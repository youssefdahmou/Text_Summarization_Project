        "body": "LOS ANGELES -- As a lively group of elderly women scurried onto a shuttle for a shopping day on a recent Tuesday afternoon, Carla and Jack Weingarten could be found snuggled under a blanket inside their Los Angeles apartment, watching \"I Love Lucy\" episodes on repeat.\n\nCarla, who's 100, and Jack, who turns 105 on Dec. 25, used to look forward to their retirement community's weekly outings. But these days, they prefer a more laid-back afternoon: Sitting side by side in their recliner chairs and watching one of Carla's favorite shows -- Jack mostly just listens because he's lost much of his vision -- as they hold hands for hours.\n\nIn August, Carla and Jack celebrated a major milestone: 82 years of marriage.\n\n\"We're very lucky,\" said Carla, who has short-term memory loss. Then she leaned over toward her husband to encourage him to chime in.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he said in agreement, before kissing her hand tenderly. Jack, whose speech and memory have faded in recent years, used to tell their two sons that the key to a healthy marriage is \"the man always having the last word: 'Yes dear.'\" Jack doesn't talk much nowadays, but when he does, he's typically calling out for Carla or telling her that he loves her multiple times a day.\n\n\"I love you too, Jackie,\" she always responds.\n\nAn estimated 17,000 centenarians live in California, with nearly 6,500 of them in Los Angeles County, according to the California Department of Finance. That number gets even smaller -- roughly 25% as estimated by the Census Bureau's American Community Survey -- when it comes to how many Californians ages 90 and up are still married. According to the Guinness World Records, the longest documented marriage in the world is 86 years.\n\nIn other words, Carla and Jack's long-lasting relationship is somewhat of an anomaly.\n\nThe couple's Hollywood-like love story began in Vienna, where Jack and Carla had been neighbors and family friends since they were kids. Their families also attended the same synagogue, though they didn't pay much attention to each other due to their five-year age difference.\n\nThe family story goes like this: Around 1936, a teenage Jack moved to what was then known as Mandatory Palestine on the advice of a teacher because antisemitism was rapidly rising in Austria and neighboring Germany. Carla fled there a few years later during World War II. Her father thought she'd be safest there because she spoke Hebrew. He'd later be killed in a concentration camp, along with her mother, younger brother and grandparents. Before Carla left Austria, Jack's mother asked her to give him a letter. His mother didn't know exactly where he was living, but she hoped Carla would find him.\n\nSoon after she arrived, Carla ran into one of Jack's childhood friends, who told her where he was, and they reunited. Carla doesn't remember what she thought of Jack when she saw him again, but his reaction was laced with the charming sense of humor he's known for, according to their sons. \"You look a lot better now,\" Jack said to 17-year-old Carla. Knowing that she didn't have any family or resources at the time, Jack told her, \"Don't worry. I'll take care of you,\" and he suggested they get married.\n\nThey tied the knot on Aug. 12, 1941, and had their first son, Joel, four years later, then their second son, Henry, in 1950. The young family moved to New York City in 1958 and made their way to Los Angeles a few months later. Jack worked for a children's apparel company, which he eventually took over, while Carla worked as a seamstress and pattern maker. She also taught sewing classes in their garage.\n\n\"They struggled moving to America, but what I respected was that they never brought that to their children,\" said Joel. Unlike some of his friends' parents, Carla and Jack didn't remind him and his brother about the sacrifices they'd made for them, he added. \"I never heard anything from my parents about what they went through. They never looked back, they only looked forward.\"\n\nJack and Carla had a vibrant social life until a couple years ago. First, Jack hurt his head after two falls and had to recuperate during days-long hospital stays. Then he got COVID-19 and pneumonia. But before all that, Jack played bridge competitively for several years. He and Carla would go to every social event at their independent living community and encourage others to attend. If there was a dance floor, they were always on it. \"They're such a loved couple here,\" said Deborah Rivera, the community's business manager. She's known them since they moved into the retirement complex nearly 15 years ago.\n\nThe couple used to travel regularly to places like Hawaii, Austria and Germany, and they have friends of various ages around the world. They've outlived many of their longtime friends. Fluent in multiple languages, including German, Hebrew and French, they typically speak to each other in German.\n\nPhotos from their trips, along with smiling images of their sons, daughters-in-law and three granddaughters, adorn every square foot of their spacious two-bedroom apartment. Carla used to love making personalized cards on her desktop computer for her loved ones' birthdays, but she no longer does that these days.\n\n\"We're lucky,\" Carla said of their lives. \"We thank God. We have no complaints. We have a good place here. We enjoy being here with the people. We have good friends.\"",

        "body": "Our editors and contributors select their top art books of this year, featuring Pacita Abad, Nan Goldin, Marina Abramovic, Wendy Red Star, and more.\n\nAmid the devastation, delight, and general sense of cognitive dissonance that suffused this year, the best way for many of us to digest and make sense of the present is to sink deeply into books probing art's past and future. Catalogues on artists from Nan Goldin to Gwen John, feminist writings on artist-parents and the many meanings of the monstrous, modern art's overlooked religious and spiritual influences, and a host of other excellent publications provided us moments of revelation, comfort, and rousing awakening. In no particular order, our editors and writers offer you the top 20 art books from the past year. -- Lakshmi Rivera Amin, editorial coordinator\n\nWe all know Christina Sharpe is one of those rare academics who tackles her subjects with true literary skill, so I was curious about her newest book that compiles short reflections, thoughts, and insights into a collection of 249 \"notes.\" Sometimes these passages read like social media posts, other times like very short stories. This is the kind of book that pokes and prods you into considering thoughts that are often floating in our minds and bodies and need to be given form -- one of Sharpe's talents. I do find the way the images are laid out a little awkward, but regardless, this is the type of book I'll place by a reading chair, knowing it could inspire new thoughts by exploring the honest musings of someone who thinks deeply about the world around them. As she explains in note 242, \"I write these ordinary things to detail the sonic and haptic vocabularies of living life under these brutal regimes.\" I had to pause for a few minutes after reading that. -- Hrag Vartanian \"10 Art Books We're Reading This November\"\n\nBuy on Bookshop | DelMonico Books and ICA Boston, October 2023\n\nThe queen of contemporary performance art has produced an impressive visual biography harnessing that strange and galvanizing energy between the personal and systemic that her best art captures and distills. Archival images are accompanied by quotes, phrases, and diaristic entries to tell the story of an unapologetically individualistic artist.\n\nCo-created with Katya Tylevich, this volume is probably one of the easiest-to-read coffee table books I've ever held, while the weight and size of the book itself echo the artist's desire to take up space. Sure, there are parts of the tale that made me think, \"maybe you should talk to someone about that,\" but then again, she's typical of many artists of her generation who used art as a way to figure out how to exist in a world that hadn't yet figured out how to financialize the crap out of contemporary art. The one major downside? It's such a visual biography that I suspect there won't be an audiobook version coming out any time soon. -- HV\n\nBuy on Bookshop | Laurence King, November 2023\n\nCuban-American artist, writer, and activist Coco Fusco is an inveterate truth-teller and a longtime fighter for the rights of the marginalized, persecuted, and dispossessed. She is the enemy of the dictatorial state and the morally rotten art establishment. This beautiful book, released in conjunction with the opening of Fusco's namesake exhibition at KW Institute for Contemporary Art in Berlin earlier this year, looks back at her influential work, including many of her memorable performances, in the three decades since she emerged on the scene in the 1990s. It's an unfinished story as Fusco is still making work and publishing words that bring deep discomfort to the powers to be. -- Hakim Bishara, \"10 Art Books to Add to Your Shelf This December\"\n\nBuy on Bookshop | Thames & Hudson, October 2023\n\nIn an art world full of feckless, two-faced opportunists, Nan Goldin stands out as an artist who doesn't hesitate to put herself on the line for a just cause. Look at how she weaned major museums off the Sackler family's dirty money with her opioid advocacy group PAIN. That's just one of the struggles she waged throughout her life. She's taken many hits along the way -- her youth and early life marked by sexual and emotional cruelty -- but she also gained myriad golden memories, many of which she captured with her camera and organized into slideshows and films. Accompanying a namesake traveling show organized by Stockholm's Moderna Museet, this book gives you a glimpse into the work and life of this once-in-a-generation artist. Here's the best part of Goldin's story: She survived. -- HB, \"10 Art Books We're Reading This November\"\n\nBuy on Bookshop | Steidl and Moderna Museet, February 2023\n\nA project conceived by Jeffrey Gibson, nearly 20 years in the making, An Indigenous Present celebrates the work of artists working across photography, weaving, fashion design, choreography, performance, writing, and more, each of whom has creatively impacted Gibson in one way or another. The book prioritizes artists' works and voices, especially when compared to other publications that rely heavily on academic essays to establish credibility, and the nonlinear format highlights the fluid, enduring nature of creative practice. Especially compelling is its exploration of artists working with music and sound, including Laura Ortman and Raven Chacon, and those forging ahead in the realm of technology and digital tools including AI, such as Kite and Dylan McLaughlin. The book defied my expectations. It's truly a gift, showing how these Indigenous artists are setting the standards for creative realms that are yet to be defined, while also carrying their traditions and communities forward. -- Nancy Zastudil\n\nBuy on Bookshop | DelMonico Books and Big NDN Press, August 2023\n\nArtist Sophia Giovannitti's perspicacious book wends its way through her personal experiences, art history, and legal frameworks to trace the parallels between art and sex work. Both, she writes, can be understood in the context of the market, yet must not be solely examined as such. Particularly against the backdrop of sex workers' criminalization due to legislation such as SESTA and FOSTA, Giovannitti's candid writing and limpid examination of the two fields challenge the way we think about them, inspiring new understandings in the process. -- LA\n\nBuy on Bookshop | Verso Books, May 2023\n\nIn a new tome titled after a word meaning \"our side,\" referring to how Apsáalooke people speak of themselves, artist Wendy Red Star highlights the links between her vast body of work and familial history. The book includes interviews she conducted with her parents, her sister, and Indigenous art curators Annika Johnson and Adriana Greci Green. The layered transcripts and full-page spreads of her artwork -- from childhood drawings to works based on Apsáalooke cultural objects held in collections -- bring each other to life, rendering her already personal work all the more powerful. -- LA, \"14 Art Books and Catalogues We're Reading This Month\"\n\nBuy on Bookshop | Radius Books, April 2023\n\nAs some spheres of the art world catch up on the fact that motherhood and artmaking are not mutually exclusive, this slender but informative text on the failure of institutions, residencies, and galleries to provide proper support to artists who choose to become parents lays bare the progress we have yet to make. As Debra Brehmer writes, critic Hettie Judah \"provides context on the history of sexism in the art world and examples of possible solutions to abide this dilemma.\" Her interviews with artists and discussion of new programs creating sustainable ways for them to both make work and parent serve as a crucial record for the future that artist-parents are working to build. -- LA\n\nRead the Review | Buy on Bookshop | Lund Humphries, January 2023\n\nWhen We See Us: A Century of Black Figuration in Painting is a must-read catalogue that accompanies the landmark, internationally touring exhibition curated by Koyo Kouoh and Tandazani Dhlakama at Zeitz Museum of Contemporary Art in Cape Town, South Africa. The sections of the book are arranged as powerful meditations on themes from the exhibition -- the everyday, joy and revelry, repose, sensuality, spirituality, and triumph and emancipation. Each contribution from the curators and invited authors historicizes and poetically interprets the aesthetics and politics of Black figural paintings in Africa and its global diaspora. As opposed to solely offering a didactic overview of the exhibition, the book provides rich theoretical engagement with Blackness and figural representation from transnational and transhistorical perspectives. Such a text is necessary to unpack our current moment, a time when African and African diasporic portraiture is prolific and Black artists are consistently expanding the medium. -- Alexandra M. Thomas, \"11 Art Books to Add to Your Reading List This Summer\"\n\nBuy on Bookshop | Thames & Hudson, March 2023\n\nGwen John is one of the most important British painters of the early 20th century. Yet, until recently, she was largely relegated to the margins of canonical art history. She was overshadowed by the men in her orbit -- brother Augustus John and lover Auguste Rodin -- and dismissed as an unambitious recluse during her lifetime, but since her death in 1939, her significance has slowly come to light. CuratorAlicia Foster's illustrated biography of John (published alongside an exhibition at the Pallant House Gallery) frames the artist as an intrepid, bohemian figure who defied the norms of her time, with a vibrant social sphere and complex interior life that both found their way into her work. After moving to Paris in 1904 with the goal of becoming a great artist, John found her signature focus: painting anonymous, solitary women in muted interiors. She went on to create dozens of indelible portraits, always of women (and occasionally of cats), many of them featured in this biography. Gwen John: Art and Life in London and Paris honors its subject's life and secures her legacy -- a truly remarkable book. -- Sophia Stewart\n\nBuy on Bookshop | Thames & Hudson, July 2023\n\nAssociating monsters and women, thanks to myths aplenty and sexism in general, is as old as patriarchy itself. But when Jenny Offill released her 2014 novel Dept. of Speculation, her use of the term \"art monster,\" specifically as it relates to women artists, struck a new chord, spawning a rich exploration and reclamation of its layered meanings. In Art Monsters: Unruly Bodies in Feminist Art, Elkin takes a poetic approach as she considers this concept in the context of feminist art and literature. She grounds her study in the symbolic duality of the forward-slash (/), which she uses to both link and distinguish her musings. Theresa Hak Kyung Cha, Virginia Woolf, Ana Mendieta, Carolee Schneemann, Sutapa Biswas, and a host of other artists with feminist perspectives on the monstrous and disobedient are threaded together and put under Elkin's magnifying glass. Straddling poetry and creative nonfiction, she invites us as readers to grapple with, and even nurture, the monsters within. -- LA, \"10 Art Books We're Reading This November\"\n\nBuy on Bookshop | Farrar, Straus and Giroux, November 2023\n\nIn art as in life, our true heroes are those who devote themselves entirely to an idea, risky as it might be. Sophie Calle belongs to that category of people. She will go wherever a project takes her, often forfeiting autonomy and control in the process. She famously shadowed a man from Paris and all the way to Venice, asked her mother to hire a private detective to follow her, worked as a hotel maid to snoop through guests' belongings, and opened her bed to strangers. She tells us the stories behind these works and others in this precious little book, combined with photographs, personal reflections, and anecdotes. However, I could've gone without art historian Clément Chéroux's overly psychoanalytical introduction to the book, which imposes too much theory on an artist who has mastered the skill of letting go. -- HB, \"11 Art Books to Add to Your Reading List This Summer\"\n\nBuy on Bookshop | Thames & Hudson, February 2023\n\nWhat caused Jackson Pollock's breakthrough moment that led to his iconic drip paintings? In her new book Spiritual Moderns, Erika Doss offers an answer that may come as a surprise. For Pollock, it wasn't just putting down the bottle and picking up a stick dripping with paint, as Hollywood and mainstream narratives suggest. It was instead the close observation of queer mystical painter Mark Tobey's \"white writing\" paintings that were inspired by Baháʼí calligraphy. The long-standing anti-religious bias in modern art glosses over how the frenetic calligraphy of the Baháʼí faith spread from Tobey to Pollock. Doss's book demonstrates that religion and mysticism have influenced modern art far more than the presentation at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City or college art history courses let on. With additional case studies on Andy Warhol, Joseph Cornell, and Agnes Pelton, Doss unearths the spiritual and religious influences that earlier generations buried. -- Daniel Larkin\n\nRead the Review | Buy on Bookshop | University of Chicago Press, May 2023\n\nBorn in 1946 in Basco, Filipina artist Pacita Abad charted an unusual course through life from the beginning. Raised in a political family that was threatened by the rise of dictator Ferdinand Marcos, Abad began studying law but was diverted into the arts during a move to San Francisco in 1971, where she witnessed the predominant counter-culture movement of the times. Abad then hitchhiked with her life partner Jack Garrity across Asia in 1973, traveling overland from Turkey to the Philippines through Iran, Afghanistan, Pakistan, India, Sri Lanka, Myanmar, Thailand, Laos, Taiwan, and Hong Kong. It was during this yearlong journey that Abad began to collect and wear traditional fabrics and jewelry and absorb the techniques and aesthetics that would ultimately shape her work for decades to come. Abad is perhaps best known for her trapunto technique, inspired by the Italian embroidery method, but this career-spanning publication, which accompanies the Pacita Abad exhibition at the Walker Art Center in Minneapolis, brings every aspect of the artist's colorful and multifaceted life and art into view. Cataloguing more than 100 works and featuring oral histories from Abad's closest interlocutors, the book extensively details the beautiful visual practice of an artist who was remarkably unbounded in lifestyle, medium, vision, and process. -- Sarah Rose Sharp\n\nRead the Review | Buy on Bookshop | Walker Art Center, June 2023\n\nPrinted in conjunction with artist Cara Levine's exhibition To Survive I Need You to Survive at the Contemporary Jewish Museum in San Francisco, This Is Not a Gun uses form and content to powerfully address police violence and gun control in the United States. Levine writes that the book, along with the eponymous long-term multidisciplinary project, \"seeks to move beyond the realms of mere empathy or sympathy and into deeply embodied self-aware conversations and actions about how race, gender, ability, and class shape our relationships to our bodies and the objects we interface with.\" What follows is over 50 entries from artists, writers, activists, and healers in creative response to 44 objects, each of which police officers say they misidentified as a gun when they shot an unarmed civilian, often fatally. Levine encouraged contributors to choose an object that resonated with them. As a reader, I approached the content in the same manner, beginning with tinfoil, cane, sub sandwich, underwear, and hands -- each inherently harmless yet circumstantially interpreted as a threat. Designed as a narrow, elongated rectangular object, the book has done more to shape my awareness of policing and bias -- whether toward race, gender, ability, class, or an intersection of these identities -- than any statistical report or DEIA training. -- NZ\n\nBuy the Book | For the Birds Trapped in Airports and Sming Sming Books, February 2023\n\nWho would've guessed that one of America's longest-running artist guilds was a group of women printmakers in a small cove along the Massachusetts shoreline? Working upstream against the growing, male-dominated Abstract Expressionist movement, the Folly Cove Designers collective was encouraged to draw from the world around them -- meaning that their designs reflect a distinct moment of their seaside hamlet in mid-century Gloucester. Scholar and curator Elena M. Sarni's book is the masterful culmination of 13 years of archival work, during which she unearthed many Folly Cove designs that haven't been seen for decades. This first-ever history of these brilliant women will be critical for lovers of ornament, printmaking, mid-century modern design, women's art history, WPA-era craft, and art pedagogy alike. -- Isabella Segalovich\n\nBuy on Bookshop | Princeton Architectural Press, August 2023\n\nI hadn't yet made it down to see Celia Álvarez Muñoz: Breaking the Binding at the New Mexico State University Museum by the end of this year, but the publication that accompanies the traveling retrospective (originating at the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego) proved worth revisiting over and over. Part career survey and part visual examination of Álvarez Muñoz's Enlightenment series, the publication's design mirrors the artist's conceptual and narrative practice of engaging text and images. Here, two books are connected by a shared cover, eschewing distinct borders and enabling a slippage of one form into the other, and a generous selection of images provides for an intimate reading. Co-curator Kate Green bookends, as it were, her essay \"Un Puro Cuento\" with recountings of Álvarez Muñoz's 1981 and 1992 performative lectures titled Petrocuatl. The essay also traces the artist's experiences in fashion illustration and advertising to her conceptual art and institutional critique, all the while foregrounding her interest in personal narrative. An exchange between Álvarez Muñoz and Roberto Tejada and essays by Josh T. Franco and Isabel Casso each delve further into the artist's experiences, influences, and collaborations. -- NZ\n\nBuy on Bookshop | Radius Books and the Museum of Contemporary Art San Diego, November 2023\n\nHow do you feel when you discover that an artist or author you love has done or said things you abhor? Does creative genius permit, even demand, a certain selfishness on the part of artists and audiences alike? What do we owe the people whom predators victimize in creating masterpieces that shape our lives, and do we partake in their monstrosity when we admire their work or embark on creative careers of our own? If you've wrestled with any of these questions, then Claire Dederer's Monsters: A Fan's Dilemma is for you. While Dederer does not break new ethical ground or offer general prescriptions, she delivers a brutally honest, compulsively readable biographical account of her struggle with these questions as they've informed her life and career -- of interest to any if not all of us invested in the arts. -- Nandini Pandey\n\nRead the Review | Buy on Bookshop | Knopf, April 2023\n\nThis second edition of The Tarot of Leonora Carrington, edited by Susan Aberth and Tere Arcq, comes courtesy of the Spanish publisher Editorial RM, with a gold cover of The Magician and The High Priestess, two cards from the surrealist artist's gorgeous tarot deck. The authors' scholarship gets more breadth in this new iteration, including a close review of each card and a deep look into how tarotic symbols and imagery appeared throughout Carrington's oeuvre. We also learn more about the artist's explorations of feminist spirituality and the alchemical possibilities of blending gender expressions -- what we might today call nonbinary or genderqueer identity. It's essential reading for surrealists and tarot practitioners alike. -- AX Mina\n\nRead the Review | Buy on Bookshop | Rm, December 2022\n\nDefinitely in the running as the book of the year, Naomi Klein's Doppelganger might not be a volume you were expecting to see on this list, but I think it is an important read for anyone into art and culture. The double, or doppelganger, is a prevalent theme in contemporary art. Klein explores the theme beautifully and poignantly, while also grappling with the practical reality that she keeps getting mixed up with Naomi Wolf, whom she describes as another White Jewish \"big idea books\" author with long brown hair. While other, weaker authors may have shunned the case of mistaken identity, Klein leans into it and uses this real-life experience as a way to examine the use of doppelgangers in everything from tech to literature, notably Philip Roth's Operation Shylock (1993) -- a favorite section of the book.\n\nWolf's own trajectory is part of the appeal of this story, notably because the former liberal intellectual darling who helped Al Gore during his 2000 Presidential bid quickly became a fixture of right-wing conspiracy podcasts in recent years, after a public fall from grace (she is a regular on a podcast hosted by former Trump advisor Steve Bannon.) Klein takes a deep dive into this alternative mediascape into which Wolf has immersed herself, offering a clear perspective on this skewed world. The book truly shines when the author steps back to make unexpected connections: her section on the doubling related to Israel, Zionism, and Palestine is a timely must-read. What you walk away with is the sense that we're all being doubled in many ways, and while we all may have our own personal experiences (I'll never forget the time someone with my same name unfriended me on Facebook,) we may have to come to terms with the fact that our online lives already function as doubles.",

        "title": "EU leader insists historic migrant deal aimed at curbing flow of asylum seekers 'does not copy the right' - 1010 WCSI",
        "body": "The European Union (EU) announced a \"historic\" new migrant deal on Wednesday meant to overhaul how the bloc processes asylum seekers ahead of next year's elections.\n\nAfter overnight talks, EU lawmakers announced that an agreement was found \"on the core political elements\" of the Pact on Asylum and Migration.\n\n\"It's truly a historic day,\" European Parliament President Roberta Metsola said, flanked by lawmakers responsible for the key parts of the agreement.\n\nWith migration likely to be a hot campaign issue ahead of EU elections next June, Metsola said it was vital to make a breakthrough.\n\n\"Let's not underestimate the risk if we had not reached such a deal,\" she told reporters. \"This means, hopefully, that member states will feel less inclined to reintroduce internal borders because the influx is being managed.\"\n\nELON MUSK JOINS ITALY PM AT FESTIVAL, SAYS 'MAKE MORE ITALIANS' TO COUNTER MIGRATION\n\nSpeaking to reporters in Brussels later Wednesday morning, Metsola admitted the deal is \"not a perfect package,\" but she championed how \"it's a center that does not copy the right, it goes on pragmatism,\" according to Politico Europe.\n\n\"Great news! We did it, we have an agreement on the whole pact of migration and asylum,\" Home Affairs Commissioner Ylva Johansson said in a video on social media celebrating the deal, which still requires a final agreement on all its 10 parts to be reached by February, and then transcribed into law before the June 6-9 elections, in order for all of its reforms to enter force.\n\nEuropean Union President Ursula von der Leyen said in a statement Wednesday that the Pact on Migration and Asylum \"will ensure that there is an effective European response to this European challenge.\"\n\n\"It means that Europeans will decide who comes to the EU and who can stay, not the smugglers. It means protecting those in need,\" she said.\n\nVon der Leyen said the pact will \"ensure that Member States share the effort responsibly, showing solidarity with those that protect our external borders while preventing illegal migration to the EU,\" as well as \"give the EU and its Member States the tools to react rapidly in situations of crisis, when Member States are faced with large numbers of illegal arrivals or instrumentalization when hostile countries deliberately attempt to destabilize the EU or its Member States.\"\n\nThe pact was touted as the answer to the EU's migration woes when it was made public in September 2020. The bloc's old rules collapsed in 2015 after well over 1 million people arrived in Europe without authorization. Most were fleeing war in Syria or Iraq, but little progress was made on the pact as the member states bickered over which country should take charge of migrants when they arrive and whether other countries should be obligated to help, according to The Associated Press.\n\nIn recent weeks, negotiators bridged differences on rules concerning the screening of migrants arriving without authorization - facial images and fingerprints will be quickly taken, including from children from the age of 6 - and the ways that this biometric data can be used. Agreement was also found on which EU countries should handle asylum applications, the procedures for doing so, and what kinds of mandatory support other countries must provide to nations struggling to cope with migrant arrivals, notably in \"crisis situations.\"\n\nThis comes as France has been on a heightened security alert since October amid the Israel-Hamas war and a series of slayings of French teachers by migrant Islamic extremists in recent years. Ireland, another European Union member state, has seen tensions rise over the resettlement of migrants in communities, and a knife attack on a woman and three children in Dublin's city center last month allegedly carried out by an Algerian immigrant prompted a night of violent riots. Afterward, authorities condemned \"far-right\" radicalization on social media.\n\nHowever, right-leaning political movements have been gaining traction across Europe as mass migration from Africa and the Middle East is seen as challenging Western values.\n\nIRELAND'S PM CONDEMNS BURNING OF HOTEL MEANT TO HOUSE MIGRANTS AS POSSIBLE ARSON ATTACK\n\nThe EU breakthrough deal was announced just after the French parliament approved a divisive immigration bill intended to strengthen France's ability to deport foreigners considered undesirable. The vote prompted a heated debate after the far-right decided to back the measure.\n\nDutch caretaker Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the deal improves \"control over migration\" with \"better asylum procedures at the external borders of the EU.\" Far-right lawmaker Geert Wilders aims to replace Rutte after sweeping to victory in last month's elections on an anti-migration platform, according to the AP.\n\nGerman Chancellor Olaf Scholz described the pact as \"a very important decision\" that will \"relieve the burden on countries that are particularly affected -- including Germany.\" Spanish Prime Minister Pedro Sánchez told parliament that the pact \"will allow us to have an improved, more humane and better coordinated management of our frontiers and migration flows.\"\n\nWednesday's deal also had its critics. In a post on X, the European Council on Refugees and Exiles - a migrant rights umbrella body - slammed the rules as \"Byzantine in their complexity and Orban-esque in their cruelty,\" a reference to Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban, who erected razor-wire fences to keep migrants out.\n\nEve Geddie, director of Amnesty International's European Institutions Office, said that it \"will set back European asylum law for decades to come,\" and \"cause more people to be put into de-facto detention at EU borders, including families with children and people in vulnerable situations.\"\n\n\"States will be able to simply pay to strengthen external borders, or fund countries outside the EU to prevent people from reaching Europe,\" Geddie added.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nOxfam's EU migration expert Stephanie Pope worried that the pact would encourage \"more detention, including of children and families in prison-like centers. They have also slammed the door on those seeking asylum with substandard procedures, fast-tracked deportation and gambled with people's lives.\"\n\nThe secretary general of the Caritas Europa charity group, Maria Nyman, said the deal shows that EU countries \"prefer to shift their asylum responsibility to non-EU countries, prevent arrivals and speed up return, exposing migrants to human rights violations.\"\n\nThe Associated Press contributed to this report.",

        "body": "The Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) appears to have scrubbed Democratic lawmakers' praise for its group from its website following blowback over its leader's controversial statements regarding Hamas, Fox News Digital has discovered.\n\nNihad Awad, CAIR's executive director, recently said he was \"happy to see\" the Oct. 7 Hamas invasion of Israel and that the Jewish state did not have a right to self-defense because it was an \"occupying power.\"\n\nAfter Awad made the contentious comments, Fox News Digital and other publications questioned Democratic lawmakers who previously expressed support for the group in letters and statements, including some posted on CAIR's endorsements and awards page.\n\nThe endorsements and awards page that contained glowing recognition from Democrats was wiped clean sometime in the past few days and now shows a '404' error.\n\nDEM LAWMAKERS HAVE HISTORY OF PRAISE FOR GROUP WHOSE LEADER SAID HE WAS 'HAPPY TO SEE' HAMAS ATTACK ISRAEL\n\nThe page was last captured by the Wayback Machine, an internet archiver, on December 4. It shows its previous state, including its \"Awards and Recognitions from Interfaith, Law Enforcement, Elected Officials and Others.\"\n\nThe page contained over 100 current and former Democratic politicians heaping praise on the group. Federal lawmakers such as Sens. Chuck Schumer of New York, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Ben Cardin of Maryland and Vice President Kamala Harris had attributable quotes on the website.\n\nAdditionally, the page contained numerous quotes from lawmakers in Congress' lower chamber, including Reps. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, Andre Carson of Indiana, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Katie Porter of California, among others.\n\nAwad caused headaches for several Democrats following his Nov. 24 speech at the 16th Annual Convention for Palestine in the U.S., where he said he was \"happy to see\" Hamas attack Israel.\n\nWHITE HOUSE SCRAMBLES TO DISTANCE ITSELF FROM ISLAMIC GROUP AFTER LEADER'S PRAISE FOR HAMAS' OCT 7TH SLAUGHTER\n\n\"The people of Gaza only decided to break the siege - the walls of the concentration camp - on Oct. 7,\" Awad said during his speech. \"And yes, I was happy to see people breaking the siege and throwing down the shackles of their own land and walk free into their land that they were not free to walk in.\"\n\n\"And yes, the people of Gaza have the right to self-defense - have the right to defend themselves. And yes, Israel as an occupying power does not have that right to self-defense,\" he said.\n\nAwad's remarks forced the White House to scramble and scrub CAIR as a committed partner to fight antisemitism on its website. A White House spokesperson also forcefully reprimanded his comments in a previous statement to Fox News Digital.\n\n\"We condemn these shocking, Antisemitic statements in the strongest terms,\" the White House spokesperson said. \"The horrific, brutal terrorist attacks committed by Hamas on October 7th were, as President Biden said, 'abhorrent' and represent 'unadulterated evil.'\"\n\nCAIR DIRECTOR SAYS HE WAS 'HAPPY' TO WITNESS OCT. 7 ATTACKS, ISRAEL 'DOES NOT HAVE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENSE'\n\nSome Democrat lawmakers who associated with or praised the group also condemned Awad's statements after facing questions about their support, while others remained silent.\n\n\"I condemn in the strongest possible terms these antisemitic statements - and anyone who tries to make excuses for Hamas' murder of innocent civilians,\" Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who also had an attributable quote on CAIR's website, previously told Fox News Digital. \"I strongly support Israel's right to defend itself and will continue to stand with the Israeli people as they fight back against Hamas' terrorism.\"\n\nSen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin told Fox News Digital that Awad exhibited \"blatantly antisemitic comments.\"\n\n\"There are no two ways about this: Hamas's October 7th terrorist attacks on Israel were completely horrific - innocent Israelis were slaughtered, hundreds of civilians were kidnapped, and now, countless families are grieving and afraid,\" Baldwin said. \"I condemn these blatantly antisemitic comments in no uncertain terms, and these remarks have led to me completely losing faith in the organization and its work.\"\n\nLikewise, Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, who previously praised a local CAIR chapter's \"diversity and equality\" efforts, pushed back against Awad's remarks.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"October 7th was a brutal and vicious attack on innocent Israeli civilians,\" Casey told Fox News Digital last week. \"I unequivocally condemn the antisemitic and hateful comments made by CAIR's leadership and any comments that celebrate the despicable acts of Hamas terrorists.\"\n\nCAIR did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment on its endorsement page.",

        "body": "TORONTO, Dec. 20, 2023 /CNW/ - Consistent with its long-established commitment to the sustainable development of Canadian critical minerals, Avalon Advanced Materials Inc. AVL AVLNF (\"Avalon\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce the publication of its 2023 Sustainability Report, which can be accessed on the Company's website found here:\n\nhttps://avalonadvancedmaterials.com/_resources/sustainability/AVL2023-Sustainability-Report.pdf\n\nThe 2023 report represents the 12 consecutive report Avalon has produced detailing our environmental impacts, health and safety reporting and economic developments as they relate to Avalon's sustainability performance.\n\n\"It has been a year of transformative change for Avalon, led by a new senior management team and reinvigorated board aligned around the creation of a vertically integrated Ontario lithium value chain,\" Scott Monteith, Avalon's Chief Executive Officer, said. \"What has not changed is Avalon's unwavering commitment to the highest standards of environmental stewardship, which can be seen in the many developments undertaken in the past 12 months. We are not talking, we are doing.\"\n\nIn addition to detailing Company developments, the 2023 Sustainability Report has transitioned to the new International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) sustainability disclosure standards, a global framework which unifies and complements existing requirements to increase efficiency and comparability and improve the overall quality of reporting. We see this as the new gold standard.\n\nThe report outlines the industry-based standards for metals and mining by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) of the IFRS Foundation, and includes all relevant metrics and analysis applicable to our projects in 2023.\n\nUnder the Company's revamped leadership, Avalon continues to embrace the principles of sustainability as core to its business practices and reaffirms its strong commitment towards implementing corporate social responsibility (\"CSR\") best practices.\n\nAvalon is committed to working closely with its Indigenous partners to create lasting economic and social benefits in the communities in which the Company operates. The Avalon management team recently completed the San'Yas Anti-Racism Indigenous Cultural Safety Training Program (Ontario) and received certification. Further, Avalon has developed and published its first Land Acknowledgement that reads as follows;\n\n\"Avalon Advanced Materials Inc. acknowledges that our work takes place within the ancestral and traditional territories of First Nations, and Métis people. We respect Indigenous rights and are committed to deepening our existing relationships while forging new lasting ties which will ensure that we and future generations benefit from the positive social and economic opportunities related to our operations.\"\n\nAvalon's leadership in applying the principles of sustainability in all of the Company's work is also benefitting the mineral exploration industry generally. Avalon is supporting the PDAC, the Ontario Mining Association and the Mining Association of Canada in their efforts to educate regulators and policymakers regarding the need to update regulations in order to encourage more and sustainable development of critical minerals resources in Canada that are vital for establishing the clean energy economy in North America and to ensure access to land for exploration purposes.\n\nOn Dec. 7, 2023 Avalon announced a non-brokered private placement of up to a maximum of 93,000,000 units of the Company (each, a \"Unit\") at a price of C$0.10 per Unit for aggregate gross proceeds of C$9.3 million (the \"Offering\"). Closing of the Offering will occur in one or multiple tranches, with the first tranche of the Offering now expected to close on or about January 31, 2024.\n\nThe net proceeds of the Offering are expected be used to fund: (i) site preparation and the preparation of a feasibility study for the Corporation's Thunder Bay Lithium Hydroxide Processing Facility; (ii) the preparation of an updated feasibility study for the Nechalacho Rare Earths & Zirconium project; (iii) repayment of the convertible debenture, including accrued interest thereon, to SCR Sibelco NV; and (iv) for working capital and general corporate purposes.\n\nAbout Avalon Advanced Materials Inc.\n\nAvalon Advanced Materials Inc. is a Canadian advanced manufacturing company focused on vertically integrating the Ontario lithium supply chain. The Company, through its joint venture with SCR-Sibelco NV, is currently developing its Separation Rapids lithium deposit near Kenora, ON, while also continuing to advance the Snowbank lithium and Lilypad lithium-caesium projects. Avalon is also working to develop its Nechalacho rare earths and zirconium project located in the Northwest Territories. This deposit contains critical minerals for use in advanced technologies in the communications and defense industries among other sectors.\n\nIn addition to these upstream activities, Avalon is executing on a key initiative to develop Ontario's first midstream lithium hydroxide processing facility in Thunder Bay, ON, a vital link bridging the lithium resources of the north with the downstream EV battery manufacturing base in the south.\n\nAvalon is listed on the TSX: AVL and OTCQB: AVLNF.\n\nThis news release contains \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation.

        "body": "As part of its activities promoting entrepreneurship and innovation in Israel, the Israel Innovation Authority (IIA) provides budgets to technology entrepreneurship projects to encourage and support their various stages, including the proof of concept (PoC) stage.\n\nEntrepreneurs may choose one of two tracks to receive IIA support and assistance to fund their PoC stage.\n\n\"Year zero\" grants are awarded in order to fund an initial PoC and knowledge transfers from academia to the company. These grants are provided through three categories of incubator tracks. The incubator tracks relevant to \"year zero\" are Benefit Track 4 (technological incubators) and Benefit Track 39 (entrepreneurship incubators in peripheral regions).\n\nAn entrepreneur interested in a supportive framework for the PoC stage may submit an incubator project proposal to an IIA-approved incubator. If the incubator is interested in the entrepreneur's proposal, they will then submit a joint application to the IIA for approval of the project through one of the following three frameworks:\n\nIf the IIA committee approves the application, the committee will determine the approved budget and the total award to grant to the applicant entrepreneur.\n\n\"Year zero\" is the PoC stage, since it precedes the incubator project's first and second operating periods. As part of \"year zero,\" the entrepreneur can receive IIA support in the form of a grant of up to 85% of the IIA-approved maximum budget of up to ILS 1.5 million, to be used for the PoC stage, technological validation, and knowledge transfers from a research institute only. The incubator in which the entrepreneur operates will provide supplementary funding of 15% of the approved budget.\n\nAn incubator project approved by the committee as a \"year zero\" PoC project will also be released from the requirement to register as a company prior to commencing activity in the incubator, and will be entitled to only one grant to fund the PoC stage.\n\nThe IIA operates another track offering a comprehensive assistance package on behalf of innovation laboratories run by leading corporations. The assistance package includes access to unique technological infrastructures, assistance with ascertaining business feasibility, conducting a pilot and identifying marketing channels, exposure to know-how, connections to investors, partners, and customers of the corporation operating the laboratory, and synergies with similar companies accepted into the laboratory.\n\nThis track is intended, inter alia, for fledgling entrepreneurs interested in establishing startup companies with global potential and who have a technological idea in one of the same fields as the laboratories operating in this track. The track makes these companies' unique infrastructure and expertise available to entrepreneurs. This is in order to provide assistance in carrying out the PoC stage and in transforming an idea into a business product.\n\nThe \"technological innovation laboratories\" track applies to four fields:\n\nThis track offers a grant of up to 85% of the IIA-approved budget up to a maximum budget of ILS 1 million. The grant is for an operating period of up to one year. It is also possible to continue receiving a grant of up to 50% of the approved budget up to a maximum budget of ILS 1 million for an additional year of operations.",

        "title": "Democrats Going Full Trump on Immigration - Lawyers, Guns & Money",
        "body": "Democrats just caving to Trumpism on immigration (at the same time that he uses the openly Nazi language Miller and Bannon are feeding him; no of course he hasn't read Mein Kampf, with that Penn education he's never read a book in his life, but he loves a good line from those who have) is just empowering Trump to do whatever he wants to immigrants if (and increasingly likely, when) he wins the presidency next year. Eric Garcia has a good piece on what this all means:\n\nNone of that should be surprising. What is more surprising is that the Senate is now negotiating how to significantly curtail immigration into the United States in exchange for aid to Ukraine. But Mr Trump's words add a new colour to the negotiations because it is entirely possible that if an agreement is reached, and he wins the election, Mr Trump could wield that new authority to implement a draconian regime for people who come to the United States.\n\nNegotiations with the bipartisan coterie on Capitol Hill have included, as friend of Inside Washington Myah Ward at Politico has reported, the potential use of \"nationwide expedited removal,\" which would allow the government to deport anyone in the country who does not have a legal basis for doing so.\n\nWhile this may register to some as Republican pablum about \"the border\" -- even though this has little to do with the US-Mexico border and may lead to removals from within the country -- Mr Trump's calls to be a dictator on \"day one\" permeate these discussions. Passing such legislation would give him tremendous latitude.\n\nUnsurprisingly, the most MAGA voices in the Senate are unfazed.\n\n\"I'm mad he wasn't tougher than that because you're seeing what's happening at the border? We're being overrun,\" Sen Tommy Tuberville of Alabama told me.\n\n...\n\nDuring Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer's press conference, I asked why Democrats were negotiating curtailing immigration with a party led by Mr Trump.\n\n\"What Donald Trump said and did was despicable, but we do have a problem at the border and Democrats know we have to solve that problem, but in keeping with our principles,\" he said.\n\nSen Bob Menendez of New Jersey, an ardent supporter of immigration reform who has criticised the negotiations, was more blunt, telling me Mr Trump was \"taking his cues from Hitler.\" But Mr Menendez has mostly been neutered in the Senate ever since his indictment, which triggered many Democrats to call for his resignation.\n\nOther Democrats vocally criticised Mr Trump's words while offering mealy-mouthed responses about giving a president this much authority to deport people.\n\n\"Also it just outrageous and he's doing it for political gain,\" Sen Catherine Cortez Masto of Nevada, the first and only Latina senator, told The Independent, noting how Mr Trump's own family includes immigrants. But when asked about negotiating on immigration, she dodged.\n\n\"I think it is important that we have Ukraine funding, Israel funding all of the above, and it needs to happen,\" she told me.\n\nFirst of all, no it doesn't. Sorry Ukraine, America giving up its basic values to fund your war with Russia is not worth it. I support funding the Ukraine war, but not at this cost. Second, Democrats are just caving on this like a house of cards. It's pathetic and sad to watch. It's also likely to send the U.S. into a spiral of committing crimes against humanity.\n\nHowever, given the racism at the core of American life, I don't doubt that the politically expedient thing to do is to place immigrants in concentration camps. Most Americans just wouldn't care.\n\nBut note that we've moved from outrage to putting babies in cages to it being bipartisan policy.",

        "body": "Investigational drugs opaganib and RHB-107 (upamostat) demonstrate distinct synergistic effect when combined individually with remdesivir, significantly improving potency while maintaining cell viability, in a new U.S. Army-funded and conducted in vitro Ebola virus study\n\nOpaganib and RHB-107 are both novel, oral, host-directed, small molecule investigational drugs that are easy to administer and distribute, with demonstrated activity against multiple viral targets, including COVID-19, and are expected to be effective against emerging viral variants\n\nOpaganib is believed to be the first host-directed molecule to show activity in Ebola virus disease, having recently delivered a statistically significant increase in survival time in a separate U.S. Army-funded in vivo Ebola virus study. RHB-107 was recently accepted for inclusion in the ACESO PROTECT adaptive platform trial for early COVID-19 outpatient treatment\n\nTEL-AVIV, Israel and RALEIGH, N.C., Dec. 20, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- RedHill Biopharma Ltd. (Nasdaq: RDHL) (\"RedHill\" or the \"Company\"), a specialty biopharmaceutical company, today announced that its two novel, oral host-directed investigational drugs, opaganib and RHB-107 (upamostat), demonstrated robust synergistic effect when combined individually with remdesivir (Veklury), significantly improving viral inhibition while maintaining cell viability, in a new U.S. Army-funded and conducted Ebola virus in vitro study.\n\n\"These encouraging in vitro results for opaganib and RHB-107 show a distinct synergy in terms of viral inhibition while maintaining cell viability (i.e., not increasing toxicity), when either is added to remdesivir, with opaganib showing the greatest synergistic effect in combination with remdesivir,\" said Jeffrey Kugelman, Ph.D., Major(P), US Army MSC, Branch Chief Synthetic Biology & Surveillance, Molecular Biology Division, U.S. Army Medical Research Institute of Infectious Diseases (USAMRIID), who led the bioinformatics analysis of the study. \"The results suggest that opaganib and upamostat may have potential or use in combination with direct antiviral agents, such as remdesivir, to improve treatment outcome, increasing efficacy while maintaining safety.\"\n\n\"Opaganib is believed to be the first host-directed molecule to show activity in Ebola virus disease, and these results add to a recent U.S. Army Ebola virus study in which opaganib delivered a statistically significant increase in mice survival time in vivo,\" said Reza Fathi, Ph.D., RedHill's SVP R&D. \"Opaganib and RHB-107 are both novel, oral, host-directed, small molecule investigational drugs with demonstrated activity against multiple viral targets, including COVID-19, and are expected to be effective against emerging viral variants. This, together with their growing safety and tolerability databases, presents a compelling hypothesis for further study of their potential in treating Ebola virus.\"\n\nUtilizing a checkerboard design to test the study compounds in combination, the study cell lines were pretreated and then infected with Ebola virus. The cells were fixed, washed and subjected to immunofluorescence staining using a virus-specific antibody. The raw data for the combination was analyzed to determine synergistic, additivity or antagonistic effects on viral inhibition while taking into account cell viability.\n\nTwice daily administered opaganib has previously demonstrated benefit in late-stage clinical studies of patients hospitalized with moderate to severe COVID-19 and was selected by the NIH Radiation and Nuclear Countermeasures Program (RNCP) for Acute Radiation Syndrome development.\n\nRHB-107 successfully met its U.S. Phase 2 study primary endpoint of safety and tolerability and delivered promising efficacy results, including marked reduction in hospitalization due to COVID-19. RHB-107 was recently accepted for inclusion in the ACESO PROTECT adaptive platform trial for early COVID-19 outpatient treatment. The 300-patient PROTECT Phase 2 RHB-107 arm, fully funded by non-dilutive external funding sources including the U.S. government, has received FDA clearance to start, with the first patient expected to be enrolled in the coming weeks. The study is being conducted in the U.S., Thailand, Ivory Coast, South Africa and Uganda, and is estimated to be completed by end of 2024.\n\nAbout Ebola virus disease:\n\nAccording to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Ebola disease is a rare and often deadly illness, caused by infection by one of a group of four viruses, known as ebolaviruses, that are found primarily in sub-Saharan Africa and are known as: Zaire, Sudan, Taï Forest (formerly Côte d'Ivoire) and Bundibugyo. Transmission of the disease is mostly through contact with an infected animal (bat or nonhuman primate), or a sick or dead person infected with an ebolavirus. The course of the illness typically progresses from \"dry\" symptoms initially (such as fever, aches and pains, and fatigue), and then progresses to \"wet\" symptoms (such as diarrhea, vomiting and unexplained hemorrhaging, bleeding or bruising) as the person becomes sicker. There are currently only two FDA-approved therapies to treat EVD caused by the Ebola virus, species Zaire ebolavirus, in adults and children; Inmazeb™, a combination of three monoclonal antibodies and Ebanga™, a single monoclonal antibody. Both are intravenously infused direct acting monoclonal antibody antivirals that bind to glycoproteins on the Ebola virus's surface to prevent the virus from entering a person's cells. There is an urgent need for host-directed small molecule therapies that may be effective against multiple strains of ebolavirus, less likely to be impacted by viral mutation, and that are easy to store, distribute and administer, especially in areas where healthcare services and infrastructures may be sub-optimal.\n\nAbout Opaganib (ABC294640)\n\nOpaganib, a proprietary investigational host-directed and potentially broad-acting drug, is a first-in-class, orally administered sphingosine kinase-2 (SPHK2) selective inhibitor with anticancer, anti-inflammatory and antiviral activity, targeting multiple potential diseases, including gastrointestinal acute radiation syndrome (GI-ARS), COVID-19, other viruses as part of pandemic preparedness, and cholangiocarcinoma (bile duct cancer).\n\nOpaganib's host-directed action is thought to work through the inhibition of multiple pathways, the induction of autophagy and apoptosis, and disruption of viral replication, through simultaneous inhibition of three sphingolipid-metabolizing enzymes in human cells (SPHK2, DES1 and GCS).\n\nOpaganib was selected by the U.S. government's Radiation and Nuclear Countermeasures Program (RNCP), led by the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases, part of the National Institutes of Health, for the nuclear medical countermeasures product development pipeline as a potential treatment for Acute Radiation Syndrome (ARS).\n\nOpaganib has received Orphan Drug designation from the FDA for the treatment of cholangiocarcinoma and has undergone studies in advanced cholangiocarcinoma (Phase 2a) and prostate cancer. Opaganib also has a Phase 1 chemoradiotherapy study protocol ready for FDA-IND submission.\n\nOpaganib has demonstrated antiviral activity against SARS-CoV-2, multiple variants, and several other viruses, such as Influenza A. Being host-targeted, and based on data accumulated to date, opaganib is expected to maintain effect against emerging viral variants. In prespecified analyses of Phase 2/3 clinical data in hospitalized patients with moderate to severe COVID-19, oral opaganib demonstrated improved viral RNA clearance, faster time to recovery and significant mortality reduction in key patient subpopulations versus placebo on top of standard of care. Data from the opaganib global Phase 2/3 study has been submitted for peer review and recently published in medRxiv.\n\nOpaganib has also shown positive preclinical results in renal fibrosis, and has the potential to target multiple oncology, radioprotection, viral, inflammatory, and gastrointestinal indications.\n\nAbout RHB-107 (upamostat)\n\nRHB-107 is a proprietary, first-in-class, once-daily orally administered investigational antiviral, that targets human serine proteases involved in preparing the spike protein for viral entry into target cells. Because it is host-cell targeted, RHB-107 is expected to also be effective against emerging viral variants with mutations in the spike protein. RHB-107 is well tolerated; in the initial COVID-19 study, among 41 patients only one reported a drug-related adverse reaction (a mild, self-limited, rash).\n\nIn addition, RHB-107 inhibits several proteases targeting cancer and inflammatory gastrointestinal disease. RHB-107 has undergone several Phase 1 studies and two Phase 2 studies, demonstrating its clinical safety profile in approximately 200 patients.\n\nRedHill acquired the exclusive worldwide rights to RHB-107, excluding China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Macao, from Germany's Heidelberg Pharmaceuticals (FSE: HPHA) (formerly WILEX AG) for all indications.\n\nAbout USAMRIID\n\nSince 1969, USAMRIID has served as the U.S. Department of Defense's lead laboratory for medical biological defense research. The core mission is to protect the warfighter from biological threats, while also investigating disease outbreaks and threats to public health. Research conducted at USAMRIID leads to medical solutions -- therapeutics, vaccines, diagnostics, and information -- that benefit both military personnel and civilians. USAMRIID is a subordinate laboratory of the U.S. Army Medical Research and Development Command.\n\nAbout RedHill Biopharma\n\nRedHill Biopharma Ltd.

        "title": "Avalon Reaffirms Commitment to Responsible Critical Minerals Development with 12th Annual Sustainability Report",
        "body": "Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - December 20, 2023) - Consistent with its long-established commitment to the sustainable development of Canadian critical minerals, Avalon Advanced Materials Inc. (TSX: AVL) (OTCQB: AVLNF) (\"Avalon\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce the publication of its 2023 Sustainability Report, which can be accessed on the Company's website found here:\n\nhttps://avalonadvancedmaterials.com/_resources/sustainability/AVL2023-Sustainability-Report.pdf\n\nThe 2023 report represents the 12 consecutive report Avalon has produced detailing our environmental impacts, health and safety reporting and economic developments as they relate to Avalon's sustainability performance.\n\n\"It has been a year of transformative change for Avalon, led by a new senior management team and reinvigorated board aligned around the creation of a vertically integrated Ontario lithium value chain,\" Scott Monteith, Avalon's Chief Executive Officer, said. \"What has not changed is Avalon's unwavering commitment to the highest standards of environmental stewardship, which can be seen in the many developments undertaken in the past 12 months. We are not talking, we are doing.\"\n\n2023 Sustainability Highlights:\n\nIn addition to detailing Company developments, the 2023 Sustainability Report has transitioned to the new International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) sustainability disclosure standards, a global framework which unifies and complements existing requirements to increase efficiency and comparability and improve the overall quality of reporting. We see this as the new gold standard.\n\nThe report outlines the industry-based standards for metals and mining by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) of the IFRS Foundation, and includes all relevant metrics and analysis applicable to our projects in 2023.\n\nUnder the Company's revamped leadership, Avalon continues to embrace the principles of sustainability as core to its business practices and reaffirms its strong commitment towards implementing corporate social responsibility (\"CSR\") best practices.\n\nIndigenous Partners\n\nAvalon is committed to working closely with its Indigenous partners to create lasting economic and social benefits in the communities in which the Company operates. The Avalon management team recently completed the San'Yas Anti-Racism Indigenous Cultural Safety Training Program (Ontario) and received certification. Further, Avalon has developed and published its first Land Acknowledgement that reads as follows;\n\n\"Avalon Advanced Materials Inc. acknowledges that our work takes place within the ancestral and traditional territories of First Nations, and Mï¿½tis people. We respect Indigenous rights and are committed to deepening our existing relationships while forging new lasting ties which will ensure that we and future generations benefit from the positive social and economic opportunities related to our operations.\"\n\nAvalon's leadership in applying the principles of sustainability in all of the Company's work is also benefitting the mineral exploration industry generally. Avalon is supporting the PDAC, the Ontario Mining Association and the Mining Association of Canada in their efforts to educate regulators and policymakers regarding the need to update regulations in order to encourage more and sustainable development of critical minerals resources in Canada that are vital for establishing the clean energy economy in North America and to ensure access to land for exploration purposes.\n\nStrategic Update\n\nOn Dec. 7, 2023 Avalon announced a non-brokered private placement of up to a maximum of 93,000,000 units of the Company (each, a \"Unit\") at a price of C$0.10 per Unit for aggregate gross proceeds of C$9.3 million (the \"Offering\"). Closing of the Offering will occur in one or multiple tranches, with the first tranche of the Offering now expected to close on or about January 31, 2024.\n\nThe net proceeds of the Offering are expected be used to fund: (i) site preparation and the preparation of a feasibility study for the Corporation's Thunder Bay Lithium Hydroxide Processing Facility; (ii) the preparation of an updated feasibility study for the Nechalacho Rare Earths & Zirconium project; (iii) repayment of the convertible debenture, including accrued interest thereon, to SCR Sibelco NV; and (iv) for working capital and general corporate purposes.\n\nAbout Avalon Advanced Materials Inc.\n\nAvalon Advanced Materials Inc. is a Canadian advanced manufacturing company focused on vertically integrating the Ontario lithium supply chain. The Company, through its joint venture with SCR-Sibelco NV, is currently developing its Separation Rapids lithium deposit near Kenora, ON, while also continuing to advance the Snowbank lithium and Lilypad lithium-caesium projects. Avalon is also working to develop its Nechalacho rare earths and zirconium project located in the Northwest Territories. This deposit contains critical minerals for use in advanced technologies in the communications and defense industries among other sectors.\n\nIn addition to these upstream activities, Avalon is executing on a key initiative to develop Ontario's first midstream lithium hydroxide processing facility in Thunder Bay, ON, a vital link bridging the lithium resources of the north with the downstream EV batery manufacturing base in the south.\n\nAvalon is listed on the TSX: AVL and OTCQB: AVLNF.\n\nFor more information and media inquiries, Zeeshan Syed, President, Avalon Advanced Materials at [email protected].\n\nForward-Looking Information\n\nThis news release contains \"forward-looking information\" within the meaning of applicable Canadian securities legislation.

Some offer instant delivery, while others spread it out over a few days or weeks to appear more natural.\n\nThis depends on the quality of the likes. Likes from real users have a higher chance of interacting with your content compared to likes from bots or inactive accounts.\n\nReputable providers often offer a retention guarantee, meaning they will replenish likes if they drop within a certain time frame.\n\nProviders usually offer a range of packages with different limits. It's advisable to choose a number that seems realistic for your page size and engagement level.\n\nIn conclusion, when it comes to boosting your Facebook presence by purchasing likes, selecting the right service is crucial.\n\nAmong the many options available, four sites have stood out for their reliability, quality, and customer satisfaction: Bulkoid, FastPromo, ViralHQ, and YtNotics.\n\nBulkoid, in particular, shines as the best choice. Its commitment to delivering real Facebook likes sets it apart, ensuring that the growth of your page is both authentic and engaging. This focus on real likes is critical for those looking to build a genuine following and foster meaningful engagement.\n\nAdditionally, Bulkoid's user-friendly interface, coupled with their excellent customer support, makes the process of buying likes seamless and stress-free.\n\nThe news and editorial staff of the Monterey Herald had no role in this post's preparation.

        "title": "Biden Admin Announces $600 Million in Taxpayer-Funded Grants for 'Environmental Justice'",
        "body": "The Biden administration is shelling out $600 million in taxpayer funds to grantmaking organizations to distribute for \"environmental justice\" projects all across the country, the Environmental Protection Agency announced Wednesday.\n\nThe funds will go to 11 different organizations, which include universities and left-wing groups that focus on advancing social justice causes in addition to their environmental advocacy, according to the EPA's announcement.\n\nEach of the recipients will in turn use the money to provide sub-grants to local organizations to pursue thousands of \"environmental justice\" projects like environmental jobs training programs and \"healthy homes\" initiatives.\n\n\"Every person has a right to drink clean water, breathe clean air, and live in a community that is healthy and safe,\" Vice President Kamala Harris said in the news release.\n\n\"For too long, however, low-income communities, immigrant communities, Native communities, and communities of color have endured disproportionate levels of air, water, and soil pollution. That is why President Joe Biden and I have put equity at the center of our nation's largest investment in climate in history.\n\n\"Today's announcement puts that commitment into action by ensuring critical resources to fund environmental justice projects across the country reach the organizations that know their communities best.\"\n\nThe funding comes from the EPA's Environmental Justice Thriving Communities Grantmaking program, which was established by the Inflation Reduction Act, President Joe Biden's bill that turned out to have very little to do with reducing inflation.\n\nThe $600 million announced on Wednesday is part of a larger $3 billion spending blitz in support of \"environmental justice\" made possible by provisions in the IRA.\n\nMost of the recipients will do their work regionally, but several of the grantees are expected to operate on a national scale, according to the EPA. Some of the grantees are universities, such as Fordham University and Texas Southern University, while others, like the Climate Justice Alliance and the Minneapolis Foundation, are left-wing groups that advocate or facilitate activism for a host of progressive causes in addition to climate advocacy.\n\nIn addition to supporting environmental activism, the Minneapolis Foundation, which is poised to receive $50 million from the EPA, provides \"racial and economic justice grants\" to groups that advance \"structural and systems change through policy advocacy, organizing and movement building,\" for example.\n\nThe Climate Justice Alliance, one of the EPA's national recipients set to reap $50 million, has repeatedly supported the Palestinian cause amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, describing the status of the Palestinians as a \"climate justice issue\" and protesting on behalf of Palestine at COP28, the United Nations' recently concluded climate summit.\n\nThe group describes itself as a leader in the movement against \"extractive systems of production, consumption and political oppression, and towards resilient, regenerative and equitable economies,\" advocating for an economic and energy transition that would \"place race, gender and class at the center of the solutions equation.\"\n\nThe group has also spread misinformation about the death of a queer and gender non-binary activist near Atlanta, Georgia.\n\nManuel Terán, known more widely by the nickname \"Tortuguita,\" opened fire on a law enforcement officer responding to unrest near the site of the \"Cop City\" training center in January. The officer returned fire, killing Tortuguita in the process, according to a racketeering indictment unveiled in September in Fulton County, Georgia.\n\nAs recently as March, Climate Justice Alliance misleadingly asserted that \"Tortuguita\" was a victim of a \"political assassination\" carried out by the police.\n\nThe Social and Environmental Entrepreneurs, a regionally focused grantee set to receive $50 million from the EPA, functions as an incubator for left-of-center activist organizations, according to its website.\n\nBeyond environmental activism, the group has also facilitated activist organizations that aspire to replace \"systems of incarceration and policing\" and boost \"voter turnout by supporting frontline voting rights organizations that mobilize communities of color, first-time voters, new Americans, youth, rural communities, returning citizens and other historically disadvantaged communities,\" for example.\n\nDaniel Turner, executive director and founder of the energy think tank Power the Future, slammed the use of taxpayer money for blatantly political purposes.\n\n\"No matter if they are dubbed grantmakers or climate corps, the mission is the same: use taxpayer dollars to build networks of political support,\" Turner said. \"And while Biden sends $600 million to his eco-friends, energy workers are stalled by Washington while families pay more for everything.\"\n\nThe White House, the EPA, Climate Justice Alliance and the Minneapolis Foundation all did not respond immediately to requests for comment. The Daily Caller News Foundation sought comment from Social and Environmental Entrepreneurs, but the organization's offices are closed for the holidays.",

        "title": "Americans haven't been this optimistic about stocks since 2021",
        "body": "Americans are getting good vibes from the US economy and stock market.\n\nNew data from the Conference Board released on Tuesday shows consumers haven't felt this good about the path forward for stocks in more than two years. According to the report, 37.4% of respondents see stocks increasing next year, up from 32.9% in November. That marks the highest level of optimism for stocks since July 2021.\n\nThe renewed optimism comes amid a blistering rally in the stock market in which the Dow Jones (^DJI) has set record highs. Meanwhile, as of Wednesday midday, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was trading just below its all-time closing high of 4,797 as investors look ahead to interest rate cuts in 2024.\n\nBroadly, the consumer confidence index reached a reading of 110.7, its highest level since the S&P 500's most recent peak in July 2023, and the second highest level in two years.\n\n\"December's increase in consumer confidence reflected more positive ratings of current business conditions and job availability, as well as less pessimistic views of business, labor market, and personal income prospects over the next six months,\" said Dana Peterson, Chief Economist at The Conference Board.\n\nPeterson added: \"December's write-in responses revealed the top issue affecting consumers remains rising prices in general, while politics, interest rates, and global conflicts all saw downticks as top concerns.\"\n\nOther key areas consumers often focus on, such as the labor market, continued to show a steady pace of job additions in November. Meanwhile, gas prices recently hit their lowest levels of 2023, contributing to the rebound in consumer optimism.\n\n\"Confidence had been waning for most of the second half of the year, which we attributed to inflation fatigue, concern that the economy would soften further next year, concern about overspending during the summer, and most recently, the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas,\" Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.\n\n\"We saw these as ongoing trends, but apparently the consumer is approaching 2024 with far more optimism than we thought.\"\n\nNotably, the shift comes as consumers feel increasingly confident that interest rates won't rise in the year ahead. More than 18% of consumers see interest rates falling next year, the highest level of conviction rates will fall since October 2021.\n\nThe sign from consumers matches recent market bets that the Federal Reserve's most likely next move with interest rates will be a cut, not a hike. As of Wednesday morning, markets have priced in a 77% chance the Fed will cut rates at its March meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool. A month ago, markets had placed a roughly 28% chance the Fed would cut in March.\n\nThe ramp up in bets comes amid a pivot in messaging from the Fed. With inflation falling faster than expected and the labor market remaining on solid ground with a historically low unemployment rate, Wall Street strategists and economists believe an ideal scenario where the Fed hits 2% inflation goal without the economy tipping into recession could be in play.\n\nJosh Schafer is a Reporter for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.",

        "title": "Americans haven't been this optimistic about stocks since 2021",
        "body": "Americans are getting good vibes from the US economy and stock market.\n\nNew data from the Conference Board released on Tuesday shows consumers haven't felt this good about the path forward for stocks in more than two years. According to the report, 37.4% of respondents see stocks increasing next year, up from 32.9% in November. That marks the highest level of optimism for stocks since July 2021.\n\nThe renewed optimism comes amid a blistering rally in the stock market in which the Dow Jones (^DJI) has set record highs. Meanwhile, as of Wednesday midday, the S&P 500 (^GSPC) was trading just below its all-time closing high of 4,797 as investors look ahead to interest rate cuts in 2024.\n\nBroadly, the consumer confidence index reached a reading of 110.7, its highest level since the S&P 500's most recent peak in July 2023, and the second highest level in two years.\n\n\"December's increase in consumer confidence reflected more positive ratings of current business conditions and job availability, as well as less pessimistic views of business, labor market, and personal income prospects over the next six months,\" said Dana Peterson, Chief Economist at The Conference Board.\n\nPeterson added: \"December's write-in responses revealed the top issue affecting consumers remains rising prices in general, while politics, interest rates, and global conflicts all saw downticks as top concerns.\"\n\nOther key areas consumers often focus on, such as the labor market, continued to show a steady pace of job additions in November. Meanwhile, gas prices recently hit their lowest levels of 2023, contributing to the rebound in consumer optimism.\n\n\"Confidence had been waning for most of the second half of the year, which we attributed to inflation fatigue, concern that the economy would soften further next year, concern about overspending during the summer, and most recently, the outbreak of war between Israel and Hamas,\" Jefferies US economist Thomas Simons wrote in a note to clients on Wednesday.\n\n\"We saw these as ongoing trends, but apparently the consumer is approaching 2024 with far more optimism than we thought.\"\n\nNotably, the shift comes as consumers feel increasingly confident that interest rates won't rise in the year ahead. More than 18% of consumers see interest rates falling next year, the highest level of conviction rates will fall since October 2021.\n\nThe sign from consumers matches recent market bets that the Federal Reserve's most likely next move with interest rates will be a cut, not a hike. As of Wednesday morning, markets have priced in a 77% chance the Fed will cut rates at its March meeting, per the CME FedWatch Tool. A month ago, markets had placed a roughly 28% chance the Fed would cut in March.\n\nThe ramp up in bets comes amid a pivot in messaging from the Fed. With inflation falling faster than expected and the labor market remaining on solid ground with a historically low unemployment rate, Wall Street strategists and economists believe an ideal scenario where the Fed hits 2% inflation goal without the economy tipping into recession could be in play.\n\nJosh Schafer is a Reporter for Yahoo Finance.\n\nClick here for in-depth analysis of the latest stock market news and events moving stock prices.",

        "title": "Beth Israel partnership offers free legal support to immigrants - The Bay State Banner",
        "body": "A new partnership between Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and Health Law Advocates will seek to provide free legal support to immigrants.\n\nThe program will allow providers at the medical center and at Bowdoin Street Health Center, which is affiliated with Beth Israel, to refer patients to Health Law Advocates for legal support, particularly around insurance access and medical debt.\n\nThrough the program, the groups hope to address social determinants of health, factors outside of medical care that affect the well-being of patients.\n\n\"While we're trying to improve the health of all patients, some things are outside of our control in terms of medical interventions but there are social interventions -- and, in this case, legal interventions -- that we can help facilitate that will actually improve patients' health, sometimes better than the medical interventions that we can do,\" said David Sontag, senior associate general counsel and director of ethics at Beth Israel Lahey Health, the health-care system that oversees the medical center.\n\nJennifer Cedor, supervising attorney at Health Law Advocates, said the partnership will work to bring greater medical equity to immigrant communities in Boston.\n\n\"Our main goal is to eliminate these systemic barriers that are in place for our immigration population to reduce health disparities within the Commonwealth and to ensure that we're providing adequate advice and representation to our immigration population,\" said Cedor, who manages the partnership and will oversee monthly clinics that will be offered.\n\nThe partnership will focus on immigrants who face several barriers to accessing medical care, including challenges with language access.\n\nTo accomplish that, Cedor, who speaks Haitian Creole, said Health Law Advocates engages a team of interpreters to assist clients.\n\nConsiderations around language are nothing new in community health centers, said Samantha Taylor, executive director at Bowdoin Street Health Center.\n\nThe center has interpreters on site, most of whom specialize in Portuguese, Cape Verdean Creole and Spanish. Many of the center's staff who help with wraparound health services are also multilingual.\n\n\"It's really the goal of many health centers to hire staff that are reflective of the community it serves,\" Taylor said. \"As you walk around the health center, whether you're encountering a community health worker or an interpreter, you're finding that our staff are able to meet the language needs of our patients.\"\n\nThe partnership will work to ensure that patients have the health benefits they are entitled to, advocate for people who have been denied services due to a lack of insurance and assist uninsured and underinsured clients with medical debt.\n\n\"We want to bridge that gap,\" Cedor said. \"We want to ensure that everyone has access to the care that they need.\"\n\nIn the longer term, the groups hope to expand and cover other legal issues, including housing, education, food security and other supplemental benefits.\n\n\"We're hoping that this is just the first piece and that then we'll build it out to be able to provide more legal services,\" Sontag said.\n\nThe three groups are sorting through how many people they will be able to assist.\n\nConversations about the medical-legal partnership started at the beginning of the year, Cedor said, with official documentation signed in March. Since then, the groups have been working to train and prepare staff, making sure they're aware of the issues that the partnership will focus on and that they're familiar with how to navigate MassHealth.\n\nAlready, staff at Beth Israel have referred a few patients but Taylor said Bowdoin Street Health Center is now ready to start sending more patients of their own.\n\n\"We're in a place now where we can really start sending a lot of referrals from Bowdoin and certainly [we are] looking to expand in the future with this partnership,\" Taylor said.\n\nOffering those services at Bowdoin Street will be an important piece of the project.\n\nThough Health Law Advocates already has partnerships with four other major health care services in the Boston area, Sontag said they traditionally tend to be found at the community health centers.",

        "body": "Congress left Washington this week without approving emergency national security spending, defying President Biden's prediction that Ukraine won't survive into the new year absent another infusion of U.S. funding.\n\nSenate leaders are vowing to take \"swift action\" on the $110 billion package for Israel, Ukraine and Taiwan early in the new year, but say talks between Republicans and Democrats on the southern border security portion need more time.\n\n\"The Senate will not let these national security challenges go unanswered,\" Majority Leader Charles E. Schumer, New York Democrat, and Minority Leader Mitch McConnell, Kentucky Republican, vowed in a rare joint statement. \"In the time remaining this year, Senate and administration negotiators will continue to work in good faith toward finalizing their agreement.\"\n\nThe Senate will return from holiday recess Jan. 8, and the House on Jan. 9.\n\nDuring Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy's visit to Washington last week, Mr. Biden said a failure by Congress to pass an additional $60 billion earmarked for Ukraine before the holidays would give Russian President Vladimir Putin \"the greatest gift they could possibly give him.\"\n\nThe U.S. has provided Ukraine with $111 billion to combat Russia's unprovoked invasion, which will officially run dry by month's end, according to the White House budget office.\n\nSen. Michael Bennet, Colorado Democrat, sought to single-handedly force passage of more Ukraine aid before year's end by blocking swift approval of a must-pass Federal Aviation Administration stopgap funding authority. The assurance from Mr. Schumer and Mr. McConnell persuaded Mr. Bennet to lift his hold, but not before assessing Mr. Biden's forecast that Ukraine's survival could be jeopardized.\n\n\"Our folks are not giving their lives in this fight, in this battle for democracy. But we are giving our treasure,\" Mr. Bennet said in a floor speech. \"We are giving our intelligence in this fight because this fight is as important for us as it is for Ukraine. I don't mean that rhetorically; I mean that literally.\"\n\nRepublicans pinned the delay squarely on Mr. Biden and Democrats, whom they accused of wasting weeks of precious negotiating time before dropping their resistance to southern border policy changes amid a record 12,000 daily illegal crossings.\n\n\"A lot of us Republicans are eager to get Ukraine the aid that it needs,\" Senate Minority Whip John Thune, South Dakota Republican, said in a floor speech. \"But we cannot -- and I say we cannot -- tend to our national security interests abroad while ignoring the national security crisis right here on our doorstep.\"\n\nOfficials from the Biden administration, including Department of Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas, became involved in the secret negotiations in recent weeks. They are being led by Sens. Chris Murphy, Connecticut Democrat; Kyrsten Sinema, Arizona Independent, and James Lankford, Oklahoma Republican.\n\nMr. Biden's more hands-on approach came after prodding from Republican and Democratic senators that the president could help talks advance. Still, Republicans are calling on the president to be more vocal.\n\nSen. John Kennedy, Louisiana Republican, said Mr. Biden would provide political \"cover\" for Democrats if he were to say what immigration policy changes he would support.",

        "title": "Biden Admin Doles Out $600 Million To Activist Groups, Universities For 'Environmental Justice'",
        "body": "The Biden administration is shelling out $600 million in taxpayer funds to grantmaking organizations to distribute for \"environmental justice\" projects all across the country, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) announced Wednesday.\n\nThe funds will go to 11 different organizations, which include universities and left-wing groups that focus on advancing social justice causes in addition to their environmental advocacy, according to the EPA's announcement. Each of the recipients will in turn use the money to provide sub-grants to local organizations to pursue thousands of \"environmental justice\" projects like environmental jobs training programs and \"healthy homes\" initiatives.\n\n\"Every person has a right to drink clean water, breathe clean air, and live in a community that is healthy and safe,\" Vice President Kamala Harris said of the funding. \"For too long, however, low-income communities, immigrant communities, Native communities, and communities of color have endured disproportionate levels of air, water, and soil pollution. That is why President Joe Biden and I have put equity at the center of our nation's largest investment in climate in history. Today's announcement puts that commitment into action by ensuring critical resources to fund environmental justice projects across the country reach the organizations that know their communities best.\"\n\nThe funding comes from the EPA's Environmental Justice Thriving Communities Grantmaking program, which was established by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), President Joe Biden's signature climate bill, according to the EPA. The $600 million announced on Wednesday is part of a larger $3 billion spending blitz in support of \"environmental justice\" made possible by provisions in the IRA.\n\nMost of the recipients will do their work regionally, but several of the grantees are expected to operate on a national scale, according to the EPA. Some of the grantees are universities, such as Fordham University and Texas Southern University, while others, like the Climate Justice Alliance and the Minneapolis Foundation, are left-wing groups that advocate or facilitate activism for a host of progressive causes in addition to climate advocacy.\n\nIn addition to supporting environmental activism, the Minneapolis Foundation, which is poised to receive $50 million from the EPA, provides \"racial and economic justice grants\" to groups that advance \"structural and systems change through policy advocacy, organizing and movement building,\" for example.\n\nThe Climate Justice Alliance, one of the EPA's national recipients set to reap $50 million, has repeatedly supported the Palestinian cause amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, describing the status of the Palestinians as a \"climate justice issue\" and protesting on behalf of Palestine at COP28, the United Nations' recently concluded climate summit. The group describes itself as a leader in the movement against \"extractive systems of production, consumption and political oppression, and towards resilient, regenerative and equitable economies,\" advocating for an economic and energy transition that would \"place race, gender and class at the center of the solutions equation.\"\n\nThe group has also spread misinformation about the death of a queer and gender non-binary activist near Atlanta, Georgia. Manuel Terán, known more widely by the nickname \"Tortuguita,\" opened fire on a law enforcement officer responding to unrest near the site of the \"Cop City\" training center in January; the officer returned fire, killing Tortuguita in the process, according to a sweeping racketeering indictment unveiled in September in Fulton County, Georgia. As recently as March, Climate Justice Alliance misleadingly asserted that \"Tortuguita\" was a victim of a \"political assassination\" carried out by the police.\n\nThe Social and Environmental Entrepreneurs, a regionally focused grantee set to receive $50 million from the EPA, functions as an incubator for left-of-center activist organizations, according to its website. Beyond environmental activism, the group has also facilitated activist organizations that aspire to replace \"systems of incarceration and policing\" and boost \"voter turnout by supporting frontline voting rights organizations that mobilize communities of color, first-time voters, new Americans, youth, rural communities, returning citizens and other historically disadvantaged communities,\" for example.\n\n\"No matter if they are dubbed grantmakers or climate corps, the mission is the same: use taxpayer dollars to build networks of political support,\" Daniel Turner, executive director and founder of Power the Future, said of the funding's announcement. \"And while Biden sends $600 million to his eco-friends, energy workers are stalled by Washington while families pay more for everything.\"\n\nThe White House, the EPA, Climate Justice Alliance and the Minneapolis Foundation all did not respond immediately to requests for comment. The Daily Caller News Foundation sought comment from Social and Environmental Entrepreneurs, but the organization's offices are closed for the holidays.",

That is why President Joe Biden and I have put equity at the center of our nation's largest investment in climate in history. Today's announcement puts that commitment into action by ensuring critical resources to fund environmental justice projects across the country reach the organizations that know their communities best.\" (RELATED: Biden's EPA Chief Says 'Environmental Justice' Is In Agency's 'DNA')\n\nThe funding comes from the EPA's Environmental Justice Thriving Communities Grantmaking program, which was established by the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA), President Joe Biden's signature climate bill, according to the EPA. The $600 million announced on Wednesday is part of a larger $3 billion spending blitz in support of \"environmental justice\" made possible by provisions in the IRA.\n\nMost of the recipients will do their work regionally, but several of the grantees are expected to operate on a national scale, according to the EPA. Some of the grantees are universities, such as Fordham University and Texas Southern University, while others, like the Climate Justice Alliance and the Minneapolis Foundation, are left-wing groups that advocate or facilitate activism for a host of progressive causes in addition to climate advocacy.\n\nIn addition to supporting environmental activism, the Minneapolis Foundation, which is poised to receive $50 million from the EPA, provides \"racial and economic justice grants\" to groups that advance \"structural and systems change through policy advocacy, organizing and movement building,\" for example.\n\nThe Climate Justice Alliance, one of the EPA's national recipients set to reap $50 million, has repeatedly supported the Palestinian cause amid the ongoing Israel-Hamas war, describing the status of the Palestinians as a \"climate justice issue\" and protesting on behalf of Palestine at COP28, the United Nations' recently concluded climate summit. The group describes itself as a leader in the movement against \"extractive systems of production, consumption and political oppression, and towards resilient, regenerative and equitable economies,\" advocating for an economic and energy transition that would \"place race, gender and class at the center of the solutions equation.\"\n\nThe group has also spread misinformation about the death of a queer and gender non-binary activist near Atlanta, Georgia. Manuel Terán, known more widely by the nickname \"Tortuguita,\" opened fire on a law enforcement officer responding to unrest near the site of the \"Cop City\" training center in January; the officer returned fire, killing Tortuguita in the process, according to a sweeping racketeering indictment unveiled in September in Fulton County, Georgia. As recently as March, Climate Justice Alliance misleadingly asserted that \"Tortuguita\" was a victim of a \"political assassination\" carried out by the police.\n\nThe Social and Environmental Entrepreneurs, a regionally focused grantee set to receive $50 million from the EPA, functions as an incubator for left-of-center activist organizations, according to its website. Beyond environmental activism, the group has also facilitated activist organizations that aspire to replace \"systems of incarceration and policing\" and boost \"voter turnout by supporting frontline voting rights organizations that mobilize communities of color, first-time voters, new Americans, youth, rural communities, returning citizens and other historically disadvantaged communities,\" for example.\n\n\"No matter if they are dubbed grantmakers or climate corps, the mission is the same: use taxpayer dollars to build networks of political support,\" Daniel Turner, executive director and founder of Power the Future, said of the funding's announcement. \"And while Biden sends $600 million to his eco-friends, energy workers are stalled by Washington while families pay more for everything.\"\n\nThe White House, the EPA, Climate Justice Alliance and the Minneapolis Foundation all did not respond immediately to requests for comment. The Daily Caller News Foundation sought comment from Social and Environmental Entrepreneurs, but the organization's offices are closed for the holidays.\n\nAll content created by the Daily Caller News Foundation, an independent and nonpartisan newswire service, is available without charge to any legitimate news publisher that can provide a large audience.

        "body": "Fox News contributor Jason Chaffetz and Israeli activist Noa Tishby join Hannity to discuss Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) director saying he was happy to witness Oct. 7 attacks.\n\nThe Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR) appears to have scrubbed Democratic lawmakers' praise for its group from its website following blowback over its leader's controversial statements regarding Hamas, Fox News Digital has discovered.\n\nNihad Awad, CAIR's executive director, recently said he was \"happy to see\" the Oct. 7 Hamas invasion of Israel and that the Jewish state did not have a right to self-defense because it was an \"occupying power.\"\n\nAfter Awad made the contentious comments, Fox News Digital and other publications questioned Democratic lawmakers who previously expressed support for the group in letters and statements, including some posted on CAIR's endorsements and awards page.\n\nThe endorsements and awards page that contained glowing recognition from Democrats was wiped clean sometime in the past few days and now shows a '404' error.\n\nDEM LAWMAKERS HAVE HISTORY OF PRAISE FOR GROUP WHOSE LEADER SAID HE WAS 'HAPPY TO SEE' HAMAS ATTACK ISRAEL\n\nThe page was last captured by the Wayback Machine, an internet archiver, on December 4. It shows its previous state, including its \"Awards and Recognitions from Interfaith, Law Enforcement, Elected Officials and Others.\"\n\nThe page contained over 100 current and former Democratic politicians heaping praise on the group. Federal lawmakers such as Sens. Chuck Schumer of New York, Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts, Cory Booker of New Jersey, Ben Cardin of Maryland and Vice President Kamala Harris had attributable quotes on the website.\n\nAdditionally, the page contained numerous quotes from lawmakers in Congress' lower chamber, including Reps. Pramila Jayapal of Washington, Andre Carson of Indiana, Ilhan Omar of Minnesota and Katie Porter of California, among others.\n\nAwad caused headaches for several Democrats following his Nov. 24 speech at the 16th Annual Convention for Palestine in the U.S., where he said he was \"happy to see\" Hamas attack Israel.\n\nWHITE HOUSE SCRAMBLES TO DISTANCE ITSELF FROM ISLAMIC GROUP AFTER LEADER'S PRAISE FOR HAMAS' OCT 7TH SLAUGHTER\n\n\"The people of Gaza only decided to break the siege - the walls of the concentration camp - on Oct. 7,\" Awad said during his speech. \"And yes, I was happy to see people breaking the siege and throwing down the shackles of their own land and walk free into their land that they were not free to walk in.\"\n\n\"And yes, the people of Gaza have the right to self-defense - have the right to defend themselves. And yes, Israel as an occupying power does not have that right to self-defense,\" he said.\n\nAwad's remarks forced the White House to scramble and scrub CAIR as a committed partner to fight antisemitism on its website. A White House spokesperson also forcefully reprimanded his comments in a previous statement to Fox News Digital.\n\n\"We condemn these shocking, Antisemitic statements in the strongest terms,\" the White House spokesperson said. \"The horrific, brutal terrorist attacks committed by Hamas on October 7th were, as President Biden said, 'abhorrent' and represent 'unadulterated evil.'\"\n\nCAIR DIRECTOR SAYS HE WAS 'HAPPY' TO WITNESS OCT. 7 ATTACKS, ISRAEL 'DOES NOT HAVE RIGHT TO SELF-DEFENSE'\n\nSome Democrat lawmakers who associated with or praised the group also condemned Awad's statements after facing questions about their support, while others remained silent.\n\n\"I condemn in the strongest possible terms these antisemitic statements - and anyone who tries to make excuses for Hamas' murder of innocent civilians,\" Sen. Sherrod Brown of Ohio, who also had an attributable quote on CAIR's website, previously told Fox News Digital. \"I strongly support Israel's right to defend itself and will continue to stand with the Israeli people as they fight back against Hamas' terrorism.\"\n\nSen. Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin told Fox News Digital that Awad exhibited \"blatantly antisemitic comments.\"\n\n\"There are no two ways about this: Hamas's October 7th terrorist attacks on Israel were completely horrific - innocent Israelis were slaughtered, hundreds of civilians were kidnapped, and now, countless families are grieving and afraid,\" Baldwin said. \"I condemn these blatantly antisemitic comments in no uncertain terms, and these remarks have led to me completely losing faith in the organization and its work.\"\n\nLikewise, Sen. Bob Casey of Pennsylvania, who previously praised a local CAIR chapter's \"diversity and equality\" efforts, pushed back against Awad's remarks.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"October 7th was a brutal and vicious attack on innocent Israeli civilians,\" Casey told Fox News Digital last week. \"I unequivocally condemn the antisemitic and hateful comments made by CAIR's leadership and any comments that celebrate the despicable acts of Hamas terrorists.\"\n\nCAIR did not respond to Fox News Digital's request for comment on its endorsement page.",

        "title": "Xi Jinping Is Fighting a Culture War at Home",
        "body": "The Chinese leader seeks to restore an earlier era of ideological indoctrination and national unity -- whether his society wants it or not.\n\nIn October, a Communist Party-run television network in the province of Hunan aired a five-episode program called When Marx Met Confucius. In it, actors portraying the European revolutionary and the ancient Chinese sage pontificate on their doctrines and discover that their ideas are in perfect harmony.\n\n\"I am longing for a supreme and far-reaching ideal world, where everyone can do their best and get what they need,\" Marx says. \"I call it a communist society.\"\n\n\"I also advocate the establishment of a society where everyone is happy and equal,\" Confucius responds. \"I call it the great unity of the world.\"\n\nThe program's message is that modern Chinese culture should be a synthesis of Marxism and China's traditions -- a fusion achieved by another great philosopher, the Chinese leader Xi Jinping. \"There has been endless debate about how traditional culture should be treated,\" one scholar on the show explains. But finally, thanks to Xi's wisdom, \"the problem was truly solved, and people's bound thoughts suddenly became clear.\"\n\nRead: The most dangerous conflict no one is talking about\n\nThe Marx and Confucius show is just one small part of Xi's campaign to fashion a new ideological conformity in China. Its apparent aim is to foster unity in preparation for struggles at home and abroad -- but with the ultimate purpose of tightening Xi's grip on China. Chinese leaders \"want to have a very powerful, socialist, ideological framework that can congeal the population, and this is of course under the party's control and guidance,\" Wang Feng, a sociologist at UC Irvine, told me. \"What's a more powerful way to centralize power than to control people's thought?\"\n\nXi's push for communist conformity might seem anachronistic in the age of social media and the global digital commons. But it's only one way he is dragging China back into an older, darker time. He has reversed decades of market liberalization in favor of renewed state intervention in the economy, returned to Cold War-style confrontation with the West after a period of fruitful cooperation, and reestablished one-man rule to a degree unseen since the days of Mao Zedong, the Communist regime's founder. Now he is attempting to restore the intense ideological indoctrination of earlier years of Communist rule -- the era of Mao's Little Red Book -- in a quest for national \"unity,\" as he defines it, and total Party dominance.\n\nIn this sense, China is in the throes of a culture war -- one that the state has been waging against society for some time, using the measures of repression available to its leader. Xi has already intensified censorship and strangled private education. Now his campaign is picking up pace. In October, he unveiled a framework he calls Xi Jinping Thought on Culture, the latest installment in a growing corpus of his \"thought\" meant to direct foreign affairs, the military, and other aspects of policy and private life. With this pronouncement, according to the state news agency Xinhua, Xi's aim is to \"provide a strong ideological guarantee, spiritual strength,\" and \"a socialist ideology that has the power to unite and inspire the people.\"\n\nRead: China changed its mind about World War II\n\nNor is this indoctrination meant to stop at China's borders. \"Profound changes in the international landscape prompt an urgent need to increase China's cultural soft power and the appeal of Chinese culture,\" Xinhua noted. In a related move in March, Xi introduced the \"Global Civilization Initiative,\" a manifesto in which he advocates \"respect for the diversity of civilizations\" and that \"coexistence transcend feelings of superiority.\" Countries, he adds, should \"refrain from imposing their own values or models on others.\"\n\nThat's Xi-speak for denying the existence of the universal rights and values that undergird the global primacy of democracy. Xi's culture war has geopolitical implications in this regard: In seeking to undercut the West's cultural influence abroad, Beijing appears to realize that winning its battle with the United States will require not just missiles and microchips, but media and messaging as well.\n\nChinese leaders have a long history of trying to control thought. In 213 B.C.E., the first emperor of the Qin dynasty became irritated with scholars who compared him and his policies unfavorably to rulers of the distant past. His solution, so the story goes, was to confiscate suspect texts on history, philosophy, and other subjects and burn them. He did this, one ancient historian commented, \"in order to make the people stupid and ensure that in all under Heaven there should be no rejection of the present by using the past.\"\n\nTwo thousand years later, Xi Jinping is attempting something similar. In October, a Chinese book distributor recalled a recent reprint of a biography of the Ming dynasty's last emperor from sellers without a clear explanation. The Chongzhen emperor, as he was known, hanged himself when his dynasty collapsed in 1644. Perhaps the book's cover language, which advertises that \"Chongzhen's repeated mistakes\" had \"hastened the nation's destruction,\" could be construed as an implicit criticism of Xi amid the country's mounting economic problems and geopolitical tensions. Whatever the reason, today's censors, much like the Qin emperor, seem to prefer that readers not compare present and past.\n\nXi's vision for China's present includes old-fashioned and supposedly \"socialist\" morality. In October, the Chinese leader shared his view that women's proper role in Chinese society is to stay home and have babies to reverse the country's population shrinkage, brought about, in part, by his party's misguided policies. He urged women to follow \"a new trend of family\" and stressed the need to \"actively cultivate a new culture of marriage and childbearing.\" In a sign of the times, Lisa, a member of the K-pop group Blackpink, was recently suspended from the Chinese social-media platform Weibo for unspecified reasons; the ban came after she had performed a burlesque show in Paris that was controversial in China. The Hong Kong celebrity Angelababy was also banned, perhaps because she may have attended the performance.\n\nOthers with lifestyles that the state considers unhealthy for communist society have also come under pressure, most notably members of the gay, lesbian, and transgender communities. In 2021, censors barred imagery of \"effeminate\" men from local television and closed dozens of social-media accounts associated with LGBTQ groups. Just this month, the government's top internet watchdog announced a crackdown on short social-media videos that have sexual content or images of cross-dressing.\n\nRead: Chinese Leaders Are Scared of Their Country's History\n\nEthnic minorities have fared still worse in this ideological framework. Xi has used his notion of national culture, largely defined by the Han Chinese majority, as a bludgeon for forcibly assimilating the country's Uyghurs, Tibetans, and other such groups. Touring Xinjiang -- home to the Uyghurs -- in 2022, Xi made the case that minority societies were all part of a greater \"Chinese culture,\" because they have been connected to Chinese civilization from time immemorial.\n\nThat narrative is inaccurate. Uyghurs and Tibetans, for instance, have their own languages and religious practices. Their societies have distinct cultural roots and have been governed by entities largely independent from China for most of their histories. Xi nevertheless instructed local officials that his version of the relationship had to be taught more concertedly in order to \"firmly forge a China heart and Chinese soul\" across the region's diverse peoples. This effort to amalgamate minorities into a single category of \"Chinese\" -- as opposed to \"citizens of China\" -- may be behind the severity of Xi's suppression of minority traditional life: The government has smothered Uyghur culture by destroying religious sites; curtailing the study of Uyghur culture, literature, and language in schools; and associating the practice of Islam with extremism. A 2020 policy reduced the study of the Mongolian language in favor of Chinese in schools in northern China, leading ethnic Mongolians to protest.\n\nThe West is subject to a parallel erasure. In a recent video that went viral on Chinese social media, Jin Canrong, an expert on U.S.-China relations at Renmin University, in Beijing, argued that \"there is a question as to whether Greece and Rome existed.\" Aristotle, he claimed, is a fabrication: No single person could have written so much on so many topics. Even the writing materials for such a volume of words would have been unavailable in antiquity, he claimed. By contrast, ancient Chinese works were relatively short -- and, by implication, more likely to be real. His listeners got the point. \"It's just common practice for European leaders to make up philosophies and philosophers in order to rule and spread their ideology,\" a commenter on Weibo opined.\n\nDuring China's decades of reform, culture and ideology took a back seat to national development and the pursuit of wealth. Xi has apparently seen fit to reverse this pragmatic turn, and to do so by promoting a new concoction of Chinese traditions and socialism. Promoting this cultural fusion, he said in a recently published speech, \"is the strongest assurance for our success,\" because \"only with cultural confidence can a nation stand firm and tall and traverse great distances.\"\n\nXi's government isn't just urging the public to adopt his new culture. He's imposing it. In October, China's rubber-stamp legislature passed the Patriotic Education Law, which mandates the intensive teaching of ideology, national defense and security, \"ethnic solidarity,\" and the \"deeds of heroes\" in schools, according to Xinhua. The purpose, a spokesperson for the legislature told local media, is to \"guide people to deeply understand the trinity of loving the country, the Party, and socialism.\"\n\nSuch heavy-handed efforts might seem poorly matched to the times. Sources of information abound, and large numbers of Chinese people travel and study abroad -- surely the government can't restrict them to state-approved ideas.\n\nBut only a small proportion of the Chinese populace possesses the interest, language skills, and resources to seek out information beyond the censors' firewall. The majority still depend on Chinese media and other sources of state-sanctioned information. Chinese authorities use this extensive control not just to keep undesirable content from the public's eyes, but also to actively shape what people believe. Throughout the crisis in Gaza, for instance, Chinese state media have fed the public a steady stream of pro-Palestinian messaging that has contributed to an upsurge in anti-Semitic and anti-Israel discourse online. Censors could easily suppress such sentiments, but they don't, because they help build domestic support for Beijing's foreign policy.\n\nThe potential consequences of Xi's culture war should worry the world. An ever more isolated, indoctrinated, and politicized Chinese populace could become that much more hostile to the West and more supportive of nationalist causes, such as a military assault to claim Taiwan. Xi's quest for social control presents risks for the Communist regime as well. Though some Chinese people may find Xi's conservative and nationalist values appealing, the segments of the population that do see beyond the firewall, or that have grown accustomed to a more open environment, are likely to bridle. As a result, \"you might see some significant polarization within Chinese society,\" Mary Gallagher, an expert on Chinese politics at the University of Michigan, told me.\n\nThe precedent for such tensions is not encouraging. Back in 1966, Mao's Cultural Revolution convulsed the country in violence, as radical Red Guards sought to stamp out ideas and practices they saw as corrupting. That campaign, too, was the work of one man determined to preserve his power.",

        "body": "Sandra (Sandie) N. Rossini, 45, of Southborough, MA, passed away surrounded by family on Thursday, December 14, 2023, at home. Sandie was the true love and devoted wife of Matt Rossini and an amazing mother to daughters Liliana (Lili) Torres and Calla Torres.\n\nSandie was born in Boston, MA, the daughter of Judie Newton and Stan Straube. Raised in Southborough, MA, and then returning after some time in Malden, MA, she cherished that ability to raise the joys of her life, Lili and Calla, in the same small town she so dearly loved.\n\nSandie is survived by her husband, Matt Rossini; daughters Liliana and Calla Torres, of Southborough, MA; mother Judie Newton of Southborough, MA; father Stan Straube and his wife, Kathy Straube, of Methuen, MA; sister Stacey Stephenson and her husband, Dan Stephenson, of Ashland, OH; brother Craig Soboleski of Rye, NH; brother Rob Soboleski and his wife, Ginger Soboleski, of Huntingtown, MD as well as many nieces and nephews, additional family members, and dear friends.\n\nFollowing her passion for music, Sandie worked for legendary music promoter, Jerry Brenner and then in marketing for Boston Radio Station 94.5 after graduating with a Bachelor of Arts at Assumption College. After the birth of Lili, Sandie pursued her entrepreneurial passion and started an artist management company for the professional beauty industry and evolved that business into an industry magazine, Your Beauty Industry, where Sandie directed photo shoots and created content covering industry manufacturers, artists, and celebrities. Sandie also went on to host a fashion show during Boston Fashion Week.\n\nIn the spring and summer of 2013, Sandie found herself struggling with increasing nausea and headaches. On July 3rd, 2013, after the discovery of a brain tumor, Sandie received emergency surgery at Beth Israel Deaconess Medical Center and was diagnosed with a Grade 4 Glioblastoma. The surgery marked the beginning of a courageous battle. Sandie refused to succumb to statistics or pay any attention to prognosis. Instead, Sandie made the immediate decision to fight, survive, and pursue a lifetime of happiness with family, friends, and her community.\n\nDrawing on her professional experience, Sandie decided to start a blog to chronicle her journey and create a product line of positive statement clothing, daily inspiration cards, and additional items. Sandie's products were carried in the Windows of Hope store at Beth Israel Hospital and Sandie carried her message to numerous local events, selling products at local businesses and through her online store.\n\nSandie connected with people battling glioblastoma and other illnesses. Sandie's ability to connect to people, relate to struggles, and empathize with others was so special and personal. Sandie appreciated everyone's struggles and challenges in life, never judging, always listening, and encouraging others to continue to fight for a positive and healthy life.\n\nSandie's greatest joy in life was her daughters. She loved the strong, independent people they'd become, their unique personalities and talents, and their massive hearts. She loved listening to them share details about their day, good and bad, and helping them through the challenges they were facing. Sandie had an unparalleled ability to listen and to allow the girls to work through situations, empowering the girls to live their lives on their terms.\n\nSandie loved simple pleasures: a sunset, a rainy day, sipping coffee, a conversation with a friend, the Boston Celtics, and horror movies. She loved trips to Cape Cod with family, thoughtful gifts, and mostly seeing others happy. She loved friends, family, and her neighbors. Sandie appreciated others' differences and points of view and was tolerant of others' beliefs regardless of her own.\n\nFamily and friends are invited to a night of remembrance on Thursday, December 21, 2023, from 4:00PM to 8:00pm at Riverview at The Hudson Portuguese Club, 13 Port Street, Hudson, MA 01749. A funeral Mass will be celebrated on Friday, December 22, 2023, at 10:00AM at St. Anne Church, 20 Boston Road, Southborough, MA 01772. Burial will follow at Southborough Rural Cemetery, 11 Cordaville Rd., Southborough, MA.\n\nIn Lieu of flowers, donations may be made to: \"A Reason to Ride Research Fund at Rhode Island Hospital\" - Attention: Mr. Andrew Miller, P.O.

Suzanne Hamner 2023-12-20 Suzanne Hamner / December 20, 2023 0 Shares Facebook Twitter Pinterest WhatsApp\n\nOn Tuesday, December 19, 2023, the Colorado State Supreme Court, in a ruling of four in favor and three against, declared that Donald Trump is \"ineligible to appear on the state's 2024 presidential primary ballot.\" The court reached this decision using Section 3 of the Fourteenth Amendment, known as the \"Insurrection Clause\".\n\nNo person shall be a Senator or Representative in Congress, or elector of President and Vice-President, or hold any office, civil or military, under the United States, or under any State, who, having previously taken an oath, as a member of Congress, or as an officer of the United States, or as a member of any State legislature, or as an executive or judicial officer of any State, to support the Constitution of the United States, shall have engaged in insurrection or rebellion against the same, or given aid or comfort to the enemies thereof. But Congress may by a vote of two-thirds of each House, remove such disability. - The Constitution for the united States of America, 14th Amendment, Section 3.\n\nSo, basically, it comes down to the question, \"Did Donald Trump engage in insurrection or rebellion when the people demonstrated outside the Capitol Building on January 6th, 2021, to have Congress address their concerns over an election that was questionable in its results?\"\n\nActivate Your Own Stem Cells & Reverse The Aging Process - Choose \"Select & Save\" OR Join, Brand Partner & Select Silver To Get Wholesale Prices Get your Vitamin B17 & Get 10% Off With Promo Code TIM How To Protect Yourself From 5G, EMF & RF Radiation Protect Your Income & Retirement Assets With Gold & Silver Grab This Bucket Of Heirloom Seeds & Get Free Shipping With Promo Code TIM Here's A Way You Can Stockpile Food For The Future Stockpile Your Ammo & Save $15 On Your First Order Preparing Also Means Detoxifying - Here's One Simple Way To Detoxify\n\nLet me issue this disclaimer. I am NOT a Trump supporter; I am NOT a Biden supporter. I support neither party, as both are unconstitutional. I am a supporter of God's law (common law), the organic law of the united States (The Declaration of Independence, The Constitution for the united States of America, etc.), and statute law when issued in congruence with the Constitution and the Declaration of Independence.\n\nRead the source article first before proceeding.\n\nNow, let's look at this excellent expose from Ms. Joanna Martin, aka Publius Huldah on elections.\n\n2. We must read each Part of the Constitution in the Light cast by the other Parts\n\nIt is impossible to understand any Part of the Constitution without understanding how that Part fits into the Whole; and how each individual Part is affected by the other Parts addressing the same subject. Accordingly, it is an ancient rule of construction that constitutional provisions or statutes that are on the same subject (in pari materia) must be construed together [link].\n\nSo it is a serious misconstruction of the 12th Amendment to assert that Congress's role on January 6 is the passive one of merely counting numbers; or that the Presiding Officer has discretion to do whatever he wants.\n\nAs shown below, specific provisions of the Constitution impose on Congress the Duty to determine whether the Electors were lawfully chosen; and whether the putative President elect and Vice-President elect are qualified for office.\n\n3. When it meets on January 6, Congress must enforce these Constitutional provisions respecting the Appointment of Electors\n\nArticle I, §4, clause 1; Article II, §1, clause 2; and Article II, §1, clause 4\n\nArt. I, §4, cl. 1 says that only state and federal legislatures have the power to make laws addressing the Times, Places and Manner of conducting federal elections. So Judges and State executive officials have no lawful authority to change the election laws made by the Legislatures!\n\nArt. II, §1, cl. 2 says that the Electors for President and Vice-President are to be appointed in such manner as the State Legislatures shall direct. So Judges and State executive officials have no lawful authority to change the election laws respecting how the Electors are to be chosen!\n\nSo Electors who were appointed in violation of these two provisions were unlawfully appointed and hence are not legally competent to cast votes for President and Vice President.\n\nArt. II, §1, cl. 4 provides that Congress may determine the Time of chusing the Electors. At 3 USC §1, Congress set the time for chusing Electors for November 3.\n\nSo Electors who were appointed after November 3 by means of late ballots (which was made possible by unconstitutional changes to state election laws which unlawfully extended the deadlines for receiving ballots past Nov. 3) were unlawfully appointed and hence are not legally competent to cast votes for President and Vice President. 2\n\n4. Congress must also enforce these Constitutional provisions respecting the qualifications for the Offices of President and Vice-President\n\nArticle II, §1, clause 5\n\nArt. II, §1, cl. 5 sets forth qualifications for the Office of President. After our first generation of Presidents [who were all born as subjects of the King of England] had passed away; the qualifications for President are that he must be a \"natural born citizen\", at least 35 years of age, and have been for at least 14 Years a Resident within the United States.\n\nThe last sentence of the 12th Amendment shows that no person who is ineligible to be President is eligible to be Vice-President. 3\n\nThe 22nd Amendment\n\nThe 22nd Amendment imposes term limits on the office of President. So any person who has already served two terms is constitutionally ineligible to be President.\n\nThe 20th Amendment, §3\n\n§3 of the 20th Amendment addresses what happens when the President elect and/or Vice-President elect \"fail to qualify\". So §3 underlines Art. II, §1, cl. 5; the last sentence of the 12th Amendment; and the 22nd Amendment: If the President elect or the Vice-President elect \"fail to qualify\", they are to be passed over.\n\nSo! The Constitutional scheme is that the Electors' choice is subject to Congress' determinations of:\n\n♦whether the requirements of Art. I, §4, cl. 1; Art. II, §1, cl.2; and Art. II, §1, cl. 4 were obeyed when the Electors were selected; and\n\n♦whether the persons whom the Electors chose meet the requirements of Art. II, §1, cl. 5; the last sentence of the 12th Amendment, and the term limits provision of the 22nd Amendment.\n\nIf not, Congress must disqualify the persons. [Text highlighted by me to keep Ms. Martin's emphases in Italics]\n\nSo, \"who\" engaged in insurrection here? Read Ms. Martin's expose in its entirety.\n\nLet's define \"insurrection\". According to Webster's 1828 dictionary, it is defined thusly:\n\nINSURREC'TION, noun [Latin insurgo; in and surgo, to rise.]\n\n1. A rising against civil or political authority; the open and active opposition of a number of persons to the execution of a law in a city or state. It is equivalent to sedition, except that sedition expresses a less extensive rising of citizens. It differs from rebellion, for the latter expresses a revolt, or an attempt to overthrow the government, to establish a different one or to place the country under another jurisdiction. It differs from mutiny, as it respects the civil or political government; whereas a mutiny is an open opposition to law in the army or navy. insurrection is however used with such latitude as to comprehend either sedition or rebellion.\n\nIt is found that this city of old time hath made insurrection against kings, and that rebellion and sedition have been made therein. Ezra 4:19.\n\n2. A rising in mass to oppose an enemy. [Little Used.]\n\nAre not officials of States, government workers, etc. citizens of the country and State? Yes. Did some officials of some States, government workers, etc. openly and actively oppose the execution of the law in those States as well as actively and openly oppose Constitutional law regarding elections? Yes. Did members of Congress (both chambers) rise against the authority of the Constitution, openly and actively, to violate the tenets of the Constitution? Yes. Did others, such as the media, openly and actively, skew results of the election, which was broadcast to homes in America? Yes. Television news media were recorded by citizens proving alteration of \"vote numbers\".\n\nWe will continue with Ms. Martin's expose at point number five.\n\n5. Congress is also bound by these Constitutional provisions\n\nThe Guaranty clause at Article IV, §4\n\nArt. IV, § 4 says:\n\n\"The United States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a Republican Form of Government...\" [emphasis added]\n\nSince the essence of a \"Republic\" is that power is exercised by Representatives elected by The People; 4 the violations of Art. I, §4, cl. 1; Art. II, §1, cl. 2; and Art. II, §1, cl.4 (which made massive election fraud possible) strike at the heart of our Constitutional Republic.\n\nWhen Electors are selected in violation of our Constitution by means of last-minute changes unlawfully made to state election laws; and/or an election is stolen by means of fraud, the Right of The People to choose their Representatives is taken away from them - and the Republic is destroyed.\n\nArt. IV, §4 imposes on Congress the Duty to guarantee lawful and honest federal elections. Congress can do this by enforcing Art. I, §4, cl. 1; Art. II, §1, cl.2; and Art. II, §1, cl. 4 by disqualifying the Electors chosen in contravention of those provisions.\n\nCongress may (and should) also disqualify Biden and Harris on the additional ground that their pretended election was procured by cheating. They must be stripped of their sham \"win\". 5\n\nThe Supremacy clause at Article VI, cl. 2\n\nArt. VI, cl. 2 says:\n\n\"This Constitution, and the Laws of the United States which shall be made in Pursuance thereof...shall be the supreme Law of the Land...\" [italics added]\n\nOnly those Acts of Congress which are consistent with the Constitution are part of the supreme Law of the Land. 6\n\nAccordingly, Sections 5 and 15 of the Electoral Count Act (3 USC §§1-21), are unconstitutional to the extent they purport to:\n\n♦require Congress to accept slates of Electors who were appointed in violation of Art. I, §4, cl.1; Art. II, §1, cl. 2; and Art. II, §1, cl. 4;\n\n♦require Congress, in the case of dueling slates of Electors, to choose the slate signed by the Governor of the State and reject the slate approved by the State Legislature; 7 and\n\n♦eliminate the 12th Amendment's dispute resolution procedures under which the House of Representatives chooses the President; and the Senate chooses the Vice-President. 8\n\nBut, contrary to what some have asserted, the 12th Amendment most manifestly does NOT vest exclusive authority and sole discretion in the President of the Senate (Vice-President Mike Pence) to determine which slates of Electors for a State are to be counted and which slates are to be rejected!\n\nAs President of the Senate, the Vice-President has certain Parliamentary powers at his disposal; but he has no \"discretion\" in deciding whether he will adhere to the Constitutional framework governing the Election. He - and every other Member of Congress - must adhere to and enforce each Constitutional provision. [Highlighted by me to maintain Ms. Martin's emphases.]\n\nOn January 6th, 2021, Trump was still president since Biden, as all presidents prior, would not be inaugurated until January 20th, 2021. And, according to this excellent expose by Edwin Viera, Jr., Trump, as president, can call forth the militia, organized and unorganized, to suppress insurrections.\n\nThe President, by using the militia * * * shall take such measures as he considers necessary to suppress, in a State, any insurrection, domestic violence, unlawful combination, or conspiracy, if it --\n\n(1) so hinders the execution of the laws of that State, and of the United States within the State, that any part or class of its people is deprived of a right, privilege, immunity, or protection named in the Constitution and secured by law, and the constituted authorities of that State are unable, fail, or refuse to protect that right, privilege, or immunity, or to give that protection; or\n\n(2) opposes or obstructs the execution of the laws of the United States or impedes the course of justice under those laws.\n\nI am NOT a constitutional scholar by any means. But, in light of what happened at the State and Federal level during the 2020 election and events surrounding it (before, during, and after), it becomes clear there was a \"conspiracy\" to deprive certain people in various States and in the united States of their right to lawfully choose electors and those States failed/refused to protect the rights of the people. And, under those circumstances, participants in the \"conspiracy\" were engaging in insurrection. Congress then failed in its duty under the Constitution to guarantee lawful and honest federal elections. Therefore, Trump had every authority to call forth the militia in those States to deal with the conspirators - which would be those who unlawfully denied the people the right of choosing electors. Moreover, the participation of Congress (both chambers/both parties) in the conspiracy by failure to guarantee lawful and honest federal elections, likewise, participated in insurrection.\n\nAgain, who actually participated in \"insurrection\" and who responded to acts of insurrection?\n\nNow, the Colorado Supreme Court has opined Trump is \"disqualified\" from holding office under Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, denying his name being placed on the presidential primary ballot in Colorado. Has there been any due process resulting in conviction of Trump for \"insurrection\"? Not yet. No one can be denied life, liberty (rights), or property, without due process of law according to The Constitution for the united States of America, Amendment Five.\n\nI urge you to read all the resources contained in the article and all exposes of Ms. Martin on mail-in voting. Remember the famous words of Nazi propaganda minister Josef Goebbels, \"accuse the other side of what you are guilty of.\"\n\nWe are supposed to be a nation of laws, not a nation subject to the \"rules\" and whims of men. But, we have become a nation subject to \"rules and whims\" of men - corrupt, criminal men. We must stand for the established law, regardless of \"persuasion\" and cult of personality. To not do so means we become \"subjects\" and slaves, not free men, of those who disregard law and the God-given rights of man.\n\nSuzanne Hamner Suzanne Hamner (pen name) is a registered nurse, grandmother of 4, and a political independent residing in the state of Georgia, who is trying to mobilize the Christian community in her area to stand up and speak out against tyrannical government, invasion by totalitarian political systems masquerading as religion and get back to the basics of education.

        "body": "NEW YORK--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec 20, 2023--\n\nRubicon Technologies, Inc. (\"Rubicon\" or the \"Company\") (NYSE: RBT), a leading provider of technology solutions for waste, recycling, and fleet operations, today celebrates the culmination of a year of notable achievements, where the Company completed, and in certain cases surpassed, a range of strategic goals across a variety of categories.\n\nBusiness Accomplishments\n\nIn the third quarter of 2022, Rubicon outlined its strategic plan and committed to materially improving its operational performance and strengthening its financial position. In its strategic plan, the Company laid out the steps required to achieve profitability and growth.\n\nRubicon has completed all of the highest priority tasks from its strategic plan, with certain goals achieved ahead of schedule. Specifically, the Company committed to:\n\nExtending debt maturities. Rubicon successfully pushed maturities out to 2025 from 2023.Improving its liquidity position. Rubicon closed a $75 million term loan and expanded its revolver capacity by $15 million.Reducing expenses. Rubicon reduced expenses by $55 million on an annualized basis.Expanding Adjusted Gross Profit Margin to double digits by the end of 2023. Rubicon surpassed 10% in the second quarter, ahead of its goal.Securing additional financing. Rubicon brought in an additional $24 million of equity financing from new and existing investors in Q2 of 2023.\n\nTo underscore the Company's exceptional performance during an extremely turbulent time, while completing all of the above it was able to drive 35.1% growth in Adjusted Gross Profit on a year-to-date basis in 2023 as compared to the same prior year period. All of this was accomplished while Rubicon continued to deliver for its customers, diverting over 800 thousand tons of waste from landfill equating to approximately 1.6 million MTCO2e emissions avoided for the first half of 2023.\n\n\"This year has been pivotal for Rubicon, and has exemplified our team's ability to achieve the Company's goals while improving our operational performance,\" said Phil Rodoni, CEO of Rubicon. \"The dedication, skill, and passion of our team have never been more evident, and are the reasons why we have been able to accomplish so much. Looking ahead, we will build upon these successes, continue to drive innovation within our industry, and fully deliver on our commitments to our customers, partners, and investors.\"\n\nCustomer Highlights\n\nRubicon also reported key business wins across the Company in 2023, including:\n\nNew, multi-year agreements with commercial customers in a wide range of industries, including Neiman Marcus, Vail Properties, Atlantis Management Group, True Food Kitchen, Wood Residential, Artisent Floors, GoldOller Real Estate Investments, and Acuity Brands.

Next Summit attendees are the first to hear about updates to our technology products, providing an unprecedented opportunity to provide direct feedback to our development teams.\n\nSustainability Leadership\n\nIn June 2023, Rubicon published its annual Corporate Citizenship Report which covered the calendar years 2021 and 2022. In the report, Rubicon's CEO, Phil Rodoni, is quoted: \"We are steadfast in our belief in the positive impact of business in society, and in the constructive role companies like ours can and should have on the world.\"\n\nIn August 2023, Rubicon launched its Technical Advisory Services (TAS) offering.

        "title": "Beyond Messiah: Handel and Bach Resound for the Holidays",
        "body": "The American Symphony Orchestra lovingly revived the oratorio 'Judas Maccabaeus' for Hanukkah, and the English Concert brought an unusually gripping Rodelinda to Carnegie Hall.\n\nIn December, concert halls and churches ring with baroque music, especially Handel's. But this year along with the composer's ubiquitous Messiah, the American Symphony Orchestra lovingly revived his oratorio Judas Maccabaeus for Hanukkah, and the English Concert's annual visit brought an unusually gripping Rodelinda to Carnegie Hall, where the Orchestra of St. Luke's embraced Bach with a rare complete Weihnachtsoratorium.\n\nThough Messiah is most often heard at Christmas, it rightly should be performed near Easter. However, one is more likely to encounter Bach at Easter when his two great Passions dominate, yet his lovely Christmas Oratorio is regularly offered. The Oratorio is made up of six cantatas: one each for the first three days of Christmas, followed by one for the first Sunday after the New Year and for the Feasts of Christ's Circumcision and the Epiphany. Each cantata lasts twenty to thirty minutes and consists of choruses, chorales, arias and duets and, like the Passions, is narrated by a tenor Evangelist.\n\nThe Orchestra of St. Luke's well-known devotion to Bach includes an annual June festival dedicated to the composer; therefore, the excellence of its Christmas Oratorio on December 4 under Principal Conductor Bernard Labadie came as no surprise. In addition to four fine vocal soloists, the concert featured La Chapelle de Québec, the superb thirty-member Canadian chorus founded by Labadie nearly forty years ago. Effortlessly filling Carnegie's large auditorium, it sang with exemplary precision and clarity accompanied by the alertly vivid orchestra. Particularly outstanding in their frequent obbligati were concertmaster Krista Bennion Feeney and first oboist Melanie Field.\n\nAndrew Hajj with his brightly candid tenor excelled as the Evangelist though the fiendishly challenging coloratura of his arias once or twice threatened to elude his grasp. Joshua Hopkins brought a vigorously forthright baritone to his many duties, while the enveloping warmth of Avery Amereau's contralto made one wish she had more to do. Fresh from her successful Metropolitan Opera debut as Oscar in Verdi's Un Ballo in Maschera, soprano Liv Redpath once again stepped up to replace the originally announced Lauren Snouffer. Redpath's glowing soprano grew even more radiant as it rose, and she partnered affectingly with the robust Hopkins in their duets.\n\nOne was grateful to OSL for offering a complete Weihnachtsoratorium. The repetitive structure of its six cantatas made one understand why usually only the first three are performed.\n\nAs London audiences grew weary of the Italian opera seria that brought Handel fame and fortune, the composer turned to English oratorios. Unlike Messiah, nearly all resemble his operas in presenting dramatis personae in conflict, and Saul, Jephtha and Theodora stand with the operas as compelling music dramas. However, Judas Maccabaeus is more of a pageant in which just two of its characters -- Judas and his brother Simon -- are named.\n\nJudas, greatly popular during the 18th and 19th Centuries, appears less frequently these days perhaps due to its occasionally uninspired score as well as its stolid, uninvolving libretto, originally conceived to stir up nationalistic fervor during the mid-1740s, a particularly trying time for the English monarchy. Described in the Apocrypha, Israel's underdog victory over the Seleucids proved an outstanding parallel for Handel's nationalistic audiences who were especially taken with the infectious smash hit \"See the conquering hero,\" which the composer snatched from his earlier Joshua.\n\nSoprano Brandie Sutton began uncertainly but soon warmed to a charmingly stylish, if lowkey account of the anonymous Israelitish Woman. As her male counterpart, Deborah Nansteel brought winning authority along with an uncertain grasp of Handel's idiom, so her frequent duets with Sutton failed to bloom. Tenor Jack Swanson's irresistibly virile Judas excelled in his rousing warmongering. His challengingly florid lines, however, sometimes lacked the smooth and easy flow that one heard from bass William Guanso Su as a gravely sonorous Simon.\n\nThe American Symphony Orchestra's music director and principal conductor Leon Botstein excels at resurrecting long-forgotten 19th- and 20th-century works rarely venturing into the pre-Romantic repertoire. However, he led Judas with a grand yet often lively touch, though Botstein's methodical reading framed the work in discrete blocks rather in urgent sequences. Prepared by James Bagwell, the combined forces of the Bard Festival Chorale and the Choir of Riverside Church (where the December 14 concert took place) sang the collective Israelites's at-first mournful then jubilant music with enviable unanimity and thrilling majesty.\n\nThe English Concert brought along the Clarion Choir when it presented Solomon at Carnegie Hall in March, but for this season's Handel there, just six singers assembled for Rodelinda which conductor Harry Bicket had led less than two years ago at the Met.\n\nThe last time the English Concert presented an opera in New York, Serse appeared as if the singers had been left to their own devices and lacked dramatic focus. Rodelinda proved consistently more involving as the performers (all using scores placed on the music stands in front of them) still interacted with fiery commitment. They were aided by Bicket's intensely propulsive guidance, and his skilled players on period instruments wielded with their accustomed polish.\n\nBrandon Cedel sounded as if his brash bass-baritone has been growing and may soon find Garibaldo's villainous coloratura less easy, but for the December 10 matinee he plotted with suavely devilish glee. While Christine Rice delighted in her character's predicaments, her dark mezzo consistently found her Eduige's music a bit too low for comfort. Though he conspicuously relied on his score more than the others, Aryeh Nussbaum Cohen as Unulfo showed off the beautifully seamless countertenor that European opera houses have recently been enjoying. His music also was sometimes a bit too low for him, but he wisely seized any chance to ornament his arias upwards.\n\nTheir characters pale next to the dangerous royal love triangle that dominates Rodelinda, the third of the remarkable trio of masterpieces, also including Giulio Cesare and Tamerlano, that Handel premiered in less than a year. Nicola Haym's taut libretto revolves around the usurper Grimoaldo's efforts to win Rodelinda, whose husband Bertarido he ordered murdered. But Bertarido survived and returns to reclaim his wife, child and throne.\n\nGrimoaldo must be Handel's most complex bad boy, whose biting outbursts are contrasted with exquisite arias of longing. Eric Fenning invested his doomed wooing of the mourning, yet defiant widow with a hypnotic urgency, yet his high, edgy tenor still commanded our sympathy. After Orlando and Rinaldo, Iestyn Davies returned for his third and most successful opera seria with the English Concert. If his countertenor again lacked heroic excitement, he sounded fresher and more involved than he has recently, and time stood still during his ravishing entrance aria \"Dove sei, amato bene?\"\n\nLucy Crowe proved a frustrating Rodelinda, the opera's resilient heroine. Long associated with Handel and the English Concert, Crowe thoughtfully wielded a brightly burnished soprano that in many ways was absolutely right for the role. Yet as in other recent performances and recordings, she often indulged in over-the-top ornamentation that invariably took her up to shrieky high notes and caused her to contort her face and body. By the final act, I dreaded every cadence or da capo repeat. In stark contrast, her Rodelinda colleagues added only exceedingly modest decoration to their arias. However, Crowe and Davies blended exquisitely in the opera's only duet which closed the second act sublimely.\n\nWhile the Met reportedly has co-productions of Handel's Alcina, Ariodante and Semele waiting in the wings, one hopes the English Concert will return next season with Tamerlano which, like Rodelinda, was a pandemic casualty. In the meantime, noted Czech mezzo-soprano Magdalena Kožená performs arias from Alcina at Zankel Hall with La Cetra on April 24 followed on May 6 by the Oratorio Society of New York's rendition of Samson.",

        "title": "Is There Anything Improper In Giving Non-Jewish Service Workers (Postal Workers, Bus Drivers, Etc.) A Special Holiday Tip?",
        "body": "The problem is that doing so encourages avoda zara celebration, an issued Chazal address in Masechet Avoda Zara. Much better to give the gift in connection with Thanksgiving. At best, say \"Seasons Greetings\" instead of \"Happy Holidays\" to avoid promoting an avoda zara holiday.\n\n- Rabbi Chaim Jachter is a prominent rabbi who serves as the rabbi at Congregation Shaarei Orah, the Sephardic Congregation of Teaneck, and is a popular Torah teacher at the Torah Academy of Bergen County. He also serves as a Dayan on the Beth Din of Elizabeth and has acquired an international reputation of excellence in the area of Get administration. He has authored sixteen books on issues ranging from contemporary Halacha, Tanach, Aggada, and Jewish Thought all available on Amazon.\n\nI am reminded of the time I gave a nice bottle of \"cherry brandy\" to the local vicar. I forgot that many of them don't drink. He had a dilemma: How to acknowledge my gift without acknowledging his drinking. He wrote me a letter of thanks: \"Dear Rabbi. Thank you for the lovely cherries. And the 'spirit' in which they were given.\"\n\nThe Gemarah Avoda Zarah clearly states that giving gifts to non-Jews at the very time of their pagan holiday would result in them thanking their idols for their good fortune. As a Jew, you would be directly responsible for facilitating that and thus it is forbidden.\n\nThat said, it is safely assumed that most non-Jews today are (a) not typically idolatrous and (b) are not inclined to go running to their places of worship to offer thanks for their good luck in receiving the gift.\n\nMoreover, a lot of leniencies have been offered over the years, with the goal of not causing ill-will among non-Jewish co-workers and improving general relationships (mishum aivah). More specifically, to quote the Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh Deah 148:12): \"If one is sending a gift to a non-Jew in our times on the day on which they consider it significant to receive presents on that holiday: if possible, [the Jew] should send him the gift the evening before. If not, he may send it on the holiday itself.\"\n\nAs other codifiers (Shach ibid) clarify: Delaying giving the gift until after the holiday would lead to the non-Jew resenting the Jew for having ignored the occasion, \"especially nowadays when it is uncommon for them to go and thank [their deity, for the gift].\"\n\nIn uncensored editions of Shulchan Aruch, the reference is explicated as being to, \"the eighth day after Xmas, which they call 'New Year.'\" Which would mean that giving a non-Jew a gift on Xmas itself might still be problematic as supporting idolatry. But if you give it as a New Year's gift, there'd be definite room for leniency.\n\nLeading contemporary authorities today maintain that saying, \"Merry Xmas\" and the like would be deemed problematic as it is an outright acknowledgment of a pagan festival, and thus the same could certainly be said about gift giving in that context as well. But \"Season's Greetings\" or certainly \"Happy New Year\" is not a problem. Hence, giving a gift or a tip to your mailman in that more generic manner is perfectly acceptable. (And you might even get your mail delivered intact and on time as a result).\n\n- Rabbi Yitzchak Schochet is a popular Lubavitch lecturer and rabbi of London's Mill Hill Synagogue\n\nThere is much discussion by our Sages on this question. What ostensibly is involved is whether or not by giving a gift or a tip to your non-Jewish service workers at their holiday time, you are inadvertently participating in their holiday, which in many cases could involve promoting idolatry. However, in our times, especially in countries outside Israel, such as the United States, where the majority of residents are not Jewish, most rabbis are of the opinion that because of \"darkei shalom,\" the promotion of peace, it would be permissible.\n\n- Rabbi Mordechai Weiss lives in Efrat, Israel, and previously served as an elementary and high school principal in New Jersey and Connecticut. He was also the founder and rav of Young Israel of Margate, N.J. His email is [email protected].\n\nAlthough the particular non-Jews referred to in the Torah there are the members of those seven nations, and there are indeed some authorities who limit this entire restriction against giving gifts to non-Jews to only those particular people (see Torah Temimah to Devarim there, No. 3), others hold that it applies to all non-Jews, but only if they are idolaters (see, for example, Shu\"t HaRashba 1:8, Sefer HaChinuch No. 426), and the Meiri cited above also excludes civilized nations who live by proper and just laws. Still others, though, maintain that it applies to all non-Jews (with the lone exception of a \"ger toshav,\" a kind of quasi-convert, a status which is no longer in effect today); this seems to be the position of the Rambam (Hil. Avodas Kochavim 10:6) and it is accepted by the Beis Yosef (Choshen Mishpat 249, d\"h assur) and others.\n\nIt is important to stress, however, that as pointed out by the Rosh in Avodah Zarah (1:19) as well as by the Ran in Gittin (20a in Rif, d\"h kol ha-meshachrer) and the aforementioned Meiri, if a Jew has a working relationship with or is a neighbor of a non-Jew and thus stands to get something in return for his gift, meaning that the Jew will also benefit from the gift, giving it is permissible. It is also allowed if the goal of giving the gift is to foster a peaceful communal environment. The explanation for this idea is that giving a gift in exchange for favors, past or future, is similar to a sale, which is certainly acceptable. The Shulchan Aruch, in the sources cited above, rules accordingly. To express appropriate thanks by tipping a non-Jewish worker, especially knowing that this will help guarantee proper - or even better - service in the future would thus certainly be allowed. (Although it is clearly not etymologically accurate, some suggest that the very word \"TIPS\" is an acronym for \"To Insure Proper Service\" or something similar.)\n\nIt should be noted, though, that even when giving a gift to non-Jews is permitted, there is an additional concern with giving it on his or her holiday. The Mishnah in Avodah Zarah (2a) restricts even business dealings with idolaters around the time of their holidays; the Gemara later there (64b-65a), however, indicates that this prohibition applies only to actual idolaters, a ruling codified by the Rambam (Hil. Avodas Kochavim 9:2) and the Shulchan Aruch (Yoreh Deah 148:5 and 8). Still, the Rema there (No. 12) writes that a Jew should avoid participating in any celebratory event on a non-Jewish religious holiday and adds that it is preferable to give any gifts to non-Jews prior to the actual holiday and not on the day itself. It is thus proper for one who wishes to give something to non-Jewish service workers as an expression of gratitude to do so prior to the day of their holiday.",

All of this was accomplished while Rubicon continued to deliver for its customers, diverting over 800 thousand tons of waste from landfill equating to approximately 1.6 million MTCO2e emissions avoided for the first half of 2023.\n\nâThis year has been pivotal for Rubicon, and has exemplified our teamâs ability to achieve the Companyâs goals while improving our operational performance,â said Phil Rodoni, CEO of Rubicon. âThe dedication, skill, and passion of our team have never been more evident, and are the reasons why we have been able to accomplish so much.

Next Summit attendees are the first to hear about updates to our technology products, providing an unprecedented opportunity to provide direct feedback to our development teams.\n\nSustainability Leadership\n\nIn June 2023, Rubicon published its annual Corporate Citizenship Report which covered the calendar years 2021 and 2022. In the report, Rubiconâs CEO, Phil Rodoni, is quoted: âWe are steadfast in our belief in the positive impact of business in society, and in the constructive role companies like ours can and should have on the world.â\n\nIn August 2023, Rubicon launched its Technical Advisory Services (TAS) offering.

There may be additional risks that Rubicon presently does not know of or that Rubicon currently believes are immaterial that could also cause actual results to differ from those contained in the forward-looking statements, many of which are beyond Rubiconâs control. You should not place undue reliance on forward-looking statements, which speak only as of the date they are made. Rubicon does not undertake, and expressly disclaims, any duty to update these forward-looking statements, except as otherwise required by applicable law.",

        "body": "Following the news, odds of the UK winning suddenly shortening to become the favourites for the first time since Katrina & The Waves won with Love Shine a Light in 1997.\n\nPrior to 1997's win, the UK first won in 1967 with Sandie Shaw's Puppet On A String. Then again in 1969 when Lulu pipped France, the Netherlands and Spain to be named winner of Eurovision following a four-way tie.\n\nA third win came in 1976 with Brotherhood of Man's Save Your Kisses for Me and Bucks Fizz's Makin' Your Mind Up in 1981.\n\nSo, if the public and jury votes go the way of the predictions, it means the UK would reign victorious at Eurovision for the sixth time when the next installment arrives in Malmö, Sweden.\n\nA KingCasinoBonus.uk told Metro: \"The UK has leapt to become the favourite to win Eurovision 2024 after announcing that Olly Alexander [as their representative].\n\n\"Bettors raced to back the UK to win the song contest following the news and the odds of the UK winning were slashed to 6/1. Sweden, Israel and Ukraine are the joint 7/1 second-favourites, followed by 8/1 shots Italy and Norway at 10/1.\n\n\"The popular Olly Alexander may think It's A Sin if he doesn't do better than Mae Muller's disappointing 25th finish last year - the UK will be quietly confident that their years without a victory in the song contest are over.\"\n\nThe favourable odds come after fans believe they have worked out the title of Alexander's Eurovision song.\n\nFollowing the announcement of his spot in the contest, the 33-year-old took to Twitter to share a video to celebrate the news while stood against the backdrop of a scene which included Big Ben, the Houses of Parliament, a red telephone box and a bus.\n\nIn the video, the BAFTA nominated star said: \"Hello Europe and Australia! This is Olly Alexander calling, I can't believe I'm about to say this but I am the UK entry for Eurovision.\n\n\"I can't believe it, I'm so so excited! This is a dream come true, I can't wait and I'll see you all in Sweden next year.\"\n\nWhile many congratulated the singer, more eagle-eyed fans got to work on guessing what all of the clues in the video meant and concluded that it could be the name of the track.\n\nOne fan on X, formerly Twitter, gathered all of the \"easter eggs\" and shared their theory about the post secretly including the title of the song.\n\nThey wrote: \"The Olly Alexander video features the number 4, 26, 26 and 25. The correlating letters are D Z Z Y.\n\n\"The big hand of the clock is a 1. The [dizzy] emoji is on the phone box. The UK's entry is called Dizzy.\"\n\nWhile many applauded the fan's efforts, another elaborated on the theory, which they said made more sense.\n\nThey wrote: \"Also there's 9 [dizzy] emojis. 9 + I which makes more sense than the big hand theory. I think you're onto something here!\"\n\nWhile another added: \"Clock is 5 past 4. Could that be the release date? 5 days past (4) April - 5th April? It's a Friday, which is typically when new music is released.\"",

        "title": "Pro-Israel Lebanese Composer Sings 'Save a Life, You Save Humanity' in Brussels",
        "body": "In a distinguished event held at the heart of Brussels last week, the European Commission played host to a concert of profound significance, aptly titled \"Save a Life, You Save Humanity.\" Renowned pianist and composer Omar Harfouch, serving as the honorary president of the Organization for Dialogue and Diversity, delivered a stirring performance dedicated to emphasizing the paramount importance of preserving human life in a region marred by the ravages of war.\n\nHarfouch, aged 54 and born in Tripoli, Lebanon, is celebrated in France for his appearances in elite social gatherings. Beyond his musical pursuits, he holds the esteemed position of co-owner of the international TV channel HDFashion & LifeStyle and the Supernova media group in Ukraine. Notably, Harfouch spearheaded a comprehensive anti-corruption initiative in Lebanon four years ago, collaborating with members of the European Parliament to uncover and seize foreign accounts containing $150 million, funds illicitly siphoned from Lebanon's budget.\n\nHarfouch has been noted for his positive statements on Israel, advocating for a lasting economic peace and campaigning for peaceful relations between the two countries.\n\nThe inspiration behind \"Save a Life, You Save Humanity\" draws from both the Quran and the Talmud, echoing the shared proclamation that \"he who saves one life, saves the entire world.\"\n\nDuring the concert, Harfouch implored political leaders in attendance to pledge a commitment: to save a life in response to the transformative power of his musical composition, specially crafted for the occasion. The composition, comprising two distinct parts symbolizing the dichotomies of today's world, asked a pivotal question: Which world do we aspire to inhabit -- the first, characterized by fulfillment, love, and tolerance, or the second, marked by sorrow, destruction, fear, loss of security, and hopelessness?\n\nThe event unfolded in the main hall of the European Commission, setting the stage for a musical evening on the eve of the European summit, a gathering of all European leaders, including French President Emmanuel Macron. This summit aimed to address critical decisions concerning the future of Ukraine and the tumultuous situation in the Middle East.\n\nAs the final notes reverberated through the hall, the audience, visibly moved, rose to their feet, some holding back tears. The resounding success prompted immediate requests from ambassadors present for Omar Harfouch and his orchestra to perform this composition in various European cities.\n\nHarfouch, accompanied by Ukrainian violinist Anna Bondarenko and an orchestra featuring fifteen musicians from diverse backgrounds -- French, Belgian, Syrian, Ukrainian, and Macedonian -- achieved a historic milestone with the first-ever classical music concert held within the official confines of the European Commission building in Brussels.",

        "title": "RELIGION: Why did Zacharias give praise to the Lord?",
        "body": "\"Blessed is the Lord God of Israel, for He has visited and redeemed His people, and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David, as He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets, who have been since the world began, that we should be saved from our enemies and from the hand of all who hate us, to perform the mercy promised to our fathers and to remember His holy covenant, the oath which He swore to our father Abraham: To grant us that we, being delivered from the hand of our enemies, might serve Him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before Him all the days of our life.\" Luke 1:68-75 (Read v. 67-79)\n\nIn the Song of Zacharias, his Benedictus or words of praise to the LORD God of Israel inspired by the Holy Spirit, Zacharias gives the reason for His song of praise to God: \"For He has visited and redeemed His people, and has raised up a horn of salvation for us in the house of His servant David, as He spoke by the mouth of His holy prophets, who have been since the world began. ...\"\n\nWe, too, can join together in the Benedictus and praise the LORD God of Israel because He came into this world -- He visited His people -- in the person of His Son, Jesus Christ, who is God Himself in human flesh. In Messiah Jesus, God redeemed His people by taking on human flesh and blood in the virgin Mary, fulfilling all righteousness for us and then bearing on the cross the full and just punishment for the sins of all and rising again from the dead.\n\nJesus is that horn of salvation raised up for us in the house of God's servant David (cf. 2 Sam. 22:2-4; Ps. 18:1-3; 80:17). Jesus' coming is in fulfillment of God's promises through the prophets since the world began. Jesus is the Seed of the woman who would crush the head of the serpent (Gen. 3:15), the Seed of Abraham who would bring blessing to all the nations of the world (Gen. 22:18), Shiloh, the rest-bringer (Gen. 49:10), the Son of David and the Root of Jesse who would establish an eternal kingdom (2 Sam. 7:16 and Isa. 11), the Child born of the virgin who is God Himself with us (Isa. 7:14 and 9:6-7), the One who would suffer and die to make atonement for the sins of all people and rise again in triumph (Ps. 22, Ps. 130 and Isa. 53), and that Ruler who be born in Bethlehem (Mic. 5:2-5a).\n\nBy His death and resurrection, Jesus delivered us from our old evil foe, the devil or Satan, who has held mankind captive since the fall of Genesis 3. And He will deliver us from all our enemies and bring us safely through this life to himself in heaven (2 Tim. 4:18), where we will \"serve Him without fear, in holiness and righteousness before Him all the days of our life\" -- even forever (Luke 1:74,75)!\n\nWe also learn from these inspired words (Luke 1:76-79) the mission of John the Baptist as the forerunner of Messiah Jesus: \"And you, child, will be called the prophet of the Highest; for you will go before the face of the Lord to prepare His ways, to give knowledge of salvation to His people by the remission of their sins, through the tender mercy of our God, with which the Dayspring from on high has visited us; to give light to those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.\"\n\nJohn was to prepare the people for the coming of their Lord and Savior by calling all to repent of their sinful ways and to look in faith to Jesus and His atoning sacrifice as \"the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world\" (John 1:29). He was to give his hearers \"knowledge of salvation\" ... \"by the remission of their sins, through the tender mercy of our God, with which the Dayspring from on high has visited us.\" John was to point people to Jesus and His cross for pardon and forgiveness.\n\nJohn was to \"give light to those who sit in darkness and the shadow of death, to guide our feet into the way of peace.\" He was to shine the light of God's Word into this dark and sinful world and show lost sinners the only way to have peace with God -- through faith in Jesus, God's Son made man, the only way to be made acceptable to God the Father and to dwell in His presence (cf. John 14:6; Acts 4:12).\n\nAnd that is what we are still called to do today as we await Christ's second coming and His judgment upon this world (cf. Luke 24:46-47).\n\nHas the \"Dayspring from on high\" risen in your hearts? Have you come to know of the salvation God has provided for you when He sent His only-begotten Son into this world to redeem you and give you life? (Cf. 2 Pet. 1:19; 2 Tim 3:15.)\n\nO gracious and merciful LORD God, our Creator and Redeemer, grant that we join with Zacharias and Your people of all generations in praising You for the salvation You have provided for us in Your Son, Christ Jesus, our Savior. And may we also share this knowledge of salvation with those around us in this dark and dying world. Amen.\n\nEditor's note: Scripture is taken from the New King James Version.

        "title": "Other editors: Ukraine, Israel aid package tied up in performative politics",
        "body": "Click #isupportlocal for more information on supporting our local journalists.\n\nThe New York Times published this editorial on Dec. 8. It was distributed by the Associated Press.\n\nThe Biden administration has asked Congress to approve a $105 billion military aid package, mostly to Israel and Ukraine, and lawmakers appear to be at an impasse over the border security measures included in it. It is essential that Congress overcome this opposition and approve it promptly, as an investment in America's security goals.\n\nHere's what this aid package is: a commitment against authoritarianism in Eastern Europe and Asia, as well as a commitment to regional stability in the Middle East. The bill includes $61.4 billion in military and economic assistance for Ukraine and about $14.3 billion in arms assistance to Israel, along with more than $9 billion in humanitarian assistance to both countries and to Gaza. To help win Republican support, the White House added $7.4 billion in security assistance to Taiwan and other Pacific allies -- as well as almost $14 billion to bolster security on the U.S. border with Mexico.\n\nHere's what this aid package is not: a decision to neglect security at home in favor of fighting conflict abroad. A strong and free Ukraine, one that is capable of standing up to Russian aggression, is essential to peace and stability in Europe. If Vladimir Putin's strategy of waiting for American resolve to falter is successful, he would then be in position to attack NATO allies and potentially draw American troops into a war, as President Biden said on Wednesday.\n\nNor is it a turn away from a humane and sensible approach to border security. The compromise that the Biden administration has put forward, and has urged Congress to pass, includes significant funds for additional Border Patrol agents, immigration judges and other border security measures.\n\nOne Democratic aide told NBC News that the party's negotiators have offered proposals to streamline asylum processing and change the \"credible fear\" standard for approving an asylum claim, a measure that immigration advocates oppose. But Republicans have rejected those reasonable compromises and reportedly are pushing for extreme measures that could effectively end asylum altogether and could mean giving the executive branch broad new power to shut down the border.\n\nThere are important and still unresolved questions about what kind of immigration this country requires, and how much. This board has supported the need for more effective border security, a more rational system of screening and admitting asylum seekers and legislation that would allow a level of immigration that better reflects the needs and values of the American public. This aid package can't address all those issues, but it could help add structure and safety to who is entering the country, when and how.\n\nThis package also should not be seen as a blanket approval of Israel's approach to war in Gaza. There are real concerns about the number of civilian casualties in this conflict so far, and the Biden administration has been appropriately vocal about these concerns. In February, the State Department put strict rules in place to try to reduce the risk of harm to civilians from the use of American weapons. So far, there is no indication that the United States considers either Israel or Ukraine to be in violation of American policy.\n\nPublicly, both Mr. Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have urged Israel to reduce the number of civilian casualties, and administration officials have become more forceful, in public statements and in private conversations with Israeli leaders. The recent humanitarian pause that the United States helped negotiate has saved many lives -- by halting the bombardments, allowing aid to enter Gaza and allowing the release of dozens of hostages held by Hamas.\n\nThe fighting in Gaza has resumed, and according to Mr. Blinken, Israel has put in place new steps to protect civilians, including keeping combat operations limited to designated areas of Gaza. Still, a \"gap\" remains \"between the intent to protect civilians and the actual results that we're seeing on the ground,\" Mr. Blinken said. As the fighting continues, the Biden administration should do everything it can to make sure that if Israel continues to use American weapons, it adheres to U.S. policy.\n\nWith so much at stake, the rancor on display this week by Senate leaders was difficult to watch. It is evidence of the performative nature of lawmaking in the United States right now, one that doesn't seem to benefit anyone except those trying to score political points. Passing this aid package would be a step toward protecting America's interests, as well as toward getting back to governing.",

        "body": "Chabad Lubavitch of Southern Colorado holds a Car Menorah Chanukah Parade every year to celebrate the Jewish holiday of Hanukkah, which this year begins Thursday evening. This year's parade will be on Sunday\n\nThe Jewish holiday of Hanukkah is broader than its 165 B.C.E. roots involving a miraculous lamp that had enough oil to burn for only one night but instead illuminated the holy temple in Jerusalem for eight days, as Maccabee soldiers claimed victory over the Syrian Greek army.\n\nThe liberation and rededication of the temple is marked at every year during Hanukkah, which is also known as The Festival of Lights.\n\nBut that doesn't just mean oil, candles, lightbulbs and electricity, said Rabbi Jay Sherwood of Temple Shalom, the largest Jewish congregation in the Pikes Peak region.\n\n\"We also think about spiritual light and the light of justice and peace and goodness in the world,\" he said.\n\n\"When we light the candles of the Hanukkah menorah, we're not only kindling a light to have the peace of the celebration of the holiday but as a reminder for ourselves and others that there's other light we need to bring in the world.\"\n\nHanukkah lasts for eight days, ending at sundown on Dec. 15.\n\nAround the world, Jewish people will light menorahs, which means \"lamp\" in Hebrew and refers to a candelabra used in worship and to commemorate the ancient miracle. Jewish communities will gather for prayer, services and parties featuring traditional dishes and customs.\n\nBut this year's joy is tempered by the atrocities and horrors of the current war between Israel and Hamas, said Jeff Ader, co-president of Temple Beit Torah in Colorado Springs.\n\n\"Our celebration is going to be impacted by the sadness we feel over the deaths of so many innocent people and the suffering of so many families both in Israel and in Gaza,\" he said.\n\nThe war, which began Oct. 7 when Hamas, the ruling party of Gaza, brutally attacked Israel, and Israel responded with military force, touches not only Jewish people, local leaders say.\n\n\"To publicize in modern times the miracle that happened with the Maccabees, we can emphasize bringing light in people's lives,\" Sherwood said. \"In hopes of bringing every single hostage home, we need to bring light into the world.\"\n\nUnder a temporary truce between the two factions that occurred Nov. 24 until Dec. 1, Hamas released 105 Israeli hostages that guerrillas had taken after the group's incursion in early October.\n\nAnd the Israel Prime Minister's Office recommended the release of 256 Palestinians from Gaza that had been detained or imprisoned.\n\nBut more captives remain -- 136 from Israel are still in Gaza, Israel officials have said. And thousands of Palestinians are detained in Israel for security issues, according to the Israel Prison Service.\n\n\"Every single hostage is a person who's being held in darkness; every hostage that's bought home is a beacon of light,\" Sherwood said. \"We have wars going on in multiple countries, and we have people who suffer every day from hunger and homelessness and disdain from others. We hope every one of those people will have light brought into the world as well.\"\n\nHanukkah also denotes the freedom the Maccabees' success gave the Jewish people, Ader said.\n\n\"We are not free when people have been slaughtered and families are torn asunder and there are hostages that have not or may not see freedom,\" he said.\n\nMany Jewish communities observing the holiday will light an extra candle in honor of the hostages, Ader said.\n\n\"I think we all pray for a peaceful resolution to all the horrible things that are going on and hopefully an end to the pain and suffering,\" he said.\n\nThe holiday's universal message of light overcoming darkness has particular relevance this year, said Rabbi Moshe Liberow, who for 22 years has led the Chabad Lubavitch of Southern Colorado and its Center for Jewish Life of Southern Colorado.\n\n\"Chanukah's message of freedom of the human spirit, freedom from tyranny and oppression and of the ultimate victory of good over evil has become a part of American culture,\" Liberow said.\n\nA key observance today is to publicly acknowledge the miracle of Hanukkah, which means \"dedication\" in Hebrew, he said.\n\nTo fulfill that aspect, Liberow will lead his annual Car Menorah Chanakah Parade on Sunday beginning at 3 p.m. from the synagogue at 6616-A Delmonico Drive.\n\n\"When confronted with hatred, the public menorah is more important than ever,\" Liberow said. \"We can have no better response to negativity we encounter than to proudly gather together, in even greater numbers than before, and celebrate the light of the menorah in public.\"\n\nTemple Shalom will hold a community lighting ceremony Thursday at 6 p.m. on the first night, filling the synagogue with Hanukkah songs, lighting the menorah's candles, and saying the blessings together.\n\n\"Despite the darkness in the world, we still celebrate the beauty and the light that's in the world,\" Sherwood said.\n\nAnd despite the sharp rise of antisemitism nationwide and attacks on Jews on college campuses and elsewhere since the war began, rabbis say they have not heard of any incidents happening in Colorado Springs.\n\nHowever, \"Individuals have heard verbal comments in the community,\" Sherwood said. Students at some Colorado Springs schools who asked not to be identified agree that they have been the target of antisemitic slurs.\n\nAder also said he does not know of anyone in his congregation who has experienced a hate crime in the past two months.\n\n\"But I know it's out there, and people in the congregation are anxious and concerned about the possibility,\" he said.\n\nColorado Springs police confirmed detectives were investigating a recent report of swastikas being painted on a west-side building, according to spokeswoman Caitlin Ford. But she said she was unaware of any recent uptick in antisemitic crime.",

        "title": "3 Hidden-Gem Stocks to Watch for a 900% Return by 2026",
        "body": "In the vast labyrinth of investment options lies diamonds in the rough -- companies often overlooked yet brimming with exceptional potential. Amidst information technology, electronic manufacturing services, semiconductor materials and equipment, and communication services, a triumvirate of stocks stands poised to deliver an astounding 900% return by 2026. These entities exhibit an aura of resilience and strategic prowess, navigating through turbulent financial tides with unwavering determination.\n\nThese three hidden gems share a compelling narrative -- a tale of consistent financial growth, adaptability in market fluctuations, and a keen eye for emerging opportunities. The article uncovers the essence of these companies. This showcases their ability to defy industry norms, seize untapped potential, and chart an upward trajectory despite the challenges of their respective sectors.\n\nRead more to learn the secrets behind these promising stocks and decipher the enigma of their staggering growth prospects.\n\nSanmina's (NASDAQ:SANM) consistent revenue growth trajectory is a key indicator of its market penetration and ability to attract and retain customers across diverse sectors. During fiscal 2023, the company witnessed a significant 13% increase in revenue, following a solid growth pattern, with a 17.5% increase in fiscal 2022 and 12.8% in the year before.\n\nFundamentally, Sanmina's revenue streams span multiple sectors, including industrial, medical, defense, aerospace, automotive, communication networks, and cloud infrastructure. This diversified portfolio shields the company from overdependence on any single market segment and positions it for growth opportunities across various industries.\n\nSimilarly, the company's ability to retain existing customers while attracting new ones is reflected in the sustained revenue growth figures over multiple years. This indicates successful relationships, quality of service, and competitive offerings that resonate with clients. Thus, the consistent revenue growth signifies Sanmina's competitive edge in capturing market share and expanding its business footprint.\n\nDown to the bottom line, Sanmina's focus on operational efficiency is highlighted by its non-GAAP operating margin improvements. For instance, in fiscal year 23, the non-GAAP operating margin increased to 5.8% from 5% in fiscal year 22, highlighting the company's ability to control costs and optimize operational efficiencies, contributing to the margin expansion. Such strategies might involve streamlining processes, optimizing resource allocation, or enhancing production efficiency.\n\nFinally, the company has articulated ambitious long-term growth goals to grow revenues between $10 billion and $12 billion in the next three years. Hence, these objectives align with a focus on providing leading-edge technology to customers in heavily regulated markets, emphasizing expansion in sectors like renewable energy, digital health, electric vehicles, and advanced networking infrastructure.\n\nPhotronics (NASDAQ:PLAB) exhibited an impressive compound annual growth (CAGR) of over 12% in revenue growth over the last six years. This consistent growth represents the company's ability to navigate market fluctuations and maintain a steady upward trajectory.\n\nPhotronics' sustained revenue growth fundamentally signifies effective strategic planning, market positioning, and adaptability to changing industry dynamics. Achieving a double-digit CAGR in a competitive semiconductor market showcases the company's resilience. Also, it represents a proactive approach to capturing market opportunities while mitigating risks. The ability to outpace industry norms suggests efficient operational strategies and the successful execution of long-term growth plans.\n\nIn 2023, Photronics grew its revenue by 8% year-over-year despite facing a flat photomask market and an expected contraction of up to 12% in the semiconductor industry. This growth against challenging market conditions highlights the company's agility and capability to outperform in adverse environments.\n\nStrategically, Photronics' ability to grow revenue despite market headwinds underlines its competitive edge. The company's differentiated approach to catering to design-driven photomask demand tends to be less cyclical than the overall industry. Thus, this strategy shields Photronics from extreme market volatility and underscores its capability to sustain growth momentum despite industry contractions.\n\nAt the bottom line, Photronics' operating income growth is at a compound annual growth rate of 41% over six years of 12% revenue growth. The rapid growth indicates efficient management and operational strategies.\n\nThe planned CapEx of $140 million focuses on IC capacity enhancement, technology nodes in demand (22-28 nanometers), and boosting capabilities in the U.S. (Boise and Allen sites). Finally, the anticipated growth in the semiconductor and display environment from mid-next year aligns well with Photronics' strategy to outgrow the market, leveraging its competitive advantages.\n\nPerion's (NASDAQ:PERI) consistent financial growth over the past three years suggests a robust and stable trajectory in revenue and adjusted EBITDA. This strength is rooted in the company's ability to expand its financial performance despite prevailing macroeconomic challenges continually. For instance, the Q3 2023 revenue increase of 17% year-over-year represents Perion's adaptability.\n\nNotably, this consistent growth pattern, marked by a two-year CAGR of 24%, underscores the efficacy of Perion's business strategies. Furthermore, Perion's diversified business model is a core strength that contributes significantly to its growth. The company has strategically expanded its portfolio to include retail media, CTV (connected TV), and innovative advertising solutions.\n\nFor instance, Perion's focus on CTV and retail media has resulted in remarkable growth rates. Year-to-date CTV revenue grew by an impressive 48% year-over-year, outpacing market growth. Similarly, retail media revenue saw a substantial 81% year-over-year increase, surpassing the expected U.S. retail media growth of less than 20% in 2023.\n\nAt the bottom line, the trend is the same, with a continuous improvement in margins and productivity. Similarly, adjusted EBITDA margin increased to 23% in the third quarter, up from 21% in the previous year and 15% in 2021. Thus, the company's ability to decipher trends and swiftly capitalize on them has been instrumental in achieving these results.\n\nDespite the war, Perion's financial strength remains robust, generating almost 100% of its revenue outside of Israel, mitigating potential geopolitical risks. Finally, Perion's strong liquidity, with net cash totaling $524 million as of Q3 2023, indicates stability and the ability to pursue strategic initiatives.",

        "title": "UN Security Council searching for a Gaza vote that US won't veto",
        "body": "The United Nations Security Council Chamber in New York, also known as the Norwegian Room. (UN Security Council/Wikimedia Commons)\n\nThe U.N. Security Council struggled Tuesday to come up with a resolution that will stop the fighting in Gaza -- at least for long enough to implement an effective flow of humanitarian aid into the enclave -- but that would not be vetoed by the United States.\n\nA morning meeting ended without a vote as negotiations continued over a new draft, seen by The Washington Post, that eliminated the word \"ceasefire,\" contained in an earlier version offered Monday. Instead, it demands an \"urgent suspension of hostilities to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access, and for urgent steps towards a sustainable cessation of hostilities.\"\n\nIn a briefing to the council, Tor Wennesland, the U.N. special coordinator for the Middle East peace process, said that humanitarian efforts to aid more than 2 million Gazans in dire need are \"near the brink\" of collapse, facing \"nearly insurmountable challenges, amid displacement on an unimaginable scale.\"\n\nA vote on a final resolution, sponsored by the United Arab Emirates, is possible later Tuesday, according to U.N. officials. The goal, officials said, is to obtain U.S. agreement to vote yes, or at least for Washington to abstain to allow the measure to pass.\n\n\"We fully support addressing the humanitarian needs of the people of Gaza, as this resolution should set out to do,\" State Department spokesman Matthew Miller said Tuesday. Negotiations \"are very much ongoing. We are engaging constructively with our colleagues on the Security Council to resolve outstanding issues.\"\n\nThe Biden administration has vetoed previous resolutions, arguing that a cease-fire ending Israel's offensive in Gaza would effectively be a victory for Hamas, leaving its military capabilities in place and its top leaders alive. The United States has also objected to the lack of a specific condemnation of Hamas in earlier resolutions and the failure to include a declaration of Israel's right to defend itself following the Oct. 7 attack that killed 1,200 people. The current version contains neither.\n\n\"It's important for us that the rest of the world understand what's at stake here. ... What Hamas did on the 7th of October and how Israel has a right to defend itself against those threats,\" White House National Security Council spokesman John Kirby told reporters Tuesday.\n\nThe draft \"demands the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages\" and access to address their medical needs. Although it directly criticizes neither Israel nor Hamas, referring to them only as \"parties to the conflict,\" the measure \"firmly condemns all violations of international humanitarian law, including all indiscriminate attacks against civilians and civilian objects, all violence and hostilities against civilians, and all acts of terrorism.\"\n\nIn recent visits to Israel by national security adviser Jake Sullivan and Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin, the Biden administration emphasized its continued support for the war's aims. But it has also voiced increasing discomfort with Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's government as global condemnation builds over Washington's refusal to call for an immediate humanitarian cease-fire.\n\nThe White House has pressured Israel to end what President Biden has called \"indiscriminate\" airstrikes and ground operations that have led to what Gazan health authorities have said are nearly 20,000 civilian deaths, and has asked for more \"targeted\" and \"surgical\" military operations against Hamas that avoid civilian casualties.\n\nThe three-page draft Security Council resolution calls for \"urgent and extended humanitarian pauses and corridors throughout the Gaza Strip for a sufficient number of days to enable full, rapid, safe and unhindered humanitarian access\" and to enable urgent rescue and recovery efforts.\n\nIt also demands the immediate and unconditional release of all hostages. An earlier, week-long pause in the fighting led to increased aid and the release of more than 100 Israeli and foreign hostages, leaving about 130 held by Hamas.\n\nOn Friday, Israel said it had recovered the bodies of three hostages in Gaza. On the same day, Israel Defense Force soldiers mistakenly shot and killed three additional hostages in the enclave.\n\nThe draft also establishes a monitoring mechanism, intended to speed up humanitarian aid deliveries, that turns over to the United Nations the current system of Israeli inspections of every truck entering Gaza. The U.N. mechanism was one of three options proposed to the council Monday by Secretary General António Guterres in a letter also seen by The Post. In addition to \"a more robust United Nations presence on the ground,\" Guterres alternatively suggested the establishment of \"a civilian observer mission (deployed by the United Nations or a third party) ... to monitor\" aid shipments \"with the consent or cooperation, as appropriate, of all relevant parties.\" A third option was the deployment of unarmed U.N. military observers.\n\nAll of those proposals are likely to be strongly opposed by Israel, which does not currently hold a seat on the 15-member council.\n\nThe resolution \"takes note\" of Israel's decision this week to open its Kerem Shalom crossing into Gaza to ease the current logjam through the Rafah crossing from Egypt -- the only entry to the enclave that Israel does not control. But it also demands that all \"parties ... allow and facilitate the use of all land, sea and air routes to and throughout the entire Gaza Strip.\"",

        "body": "ANNALS OF DARK MONEY: Job Creators Network, the network of conservative small business advocacy groups that helped lead this year's successful legal challenge to President Joe Biden's student debt relief plan, brought in more than $7 million in revenues in 2022, according to tax filings for the nonprofit and its affiliated charitable arm, the Job Creators Network Foundation. Neither nonprofit is required to disclose its donors.\n\n-- JCN's 501(c)(4) arm reported more than $2.8 million in revenues, including two transfers of publicly traded securities worth a little over $400,000, according to its newest filing, which was shared with PI by liberal watchdog group Accountable.US.\n\n-- The group dropped $3.2 million on three different programs, including marketing efforts to \"identify, recruit and sign up CEOs and small businesses for the purpose of educating the public in the defense and preservation of free enterprise and entrepreneurship\" and education efforts to \"sign up companies to receive employer to employee education materials to distribute to their employees to help educate them on what it takes to create jobs and how bad policy hurts good people,\" which the group said \"will generate a better informed and educated voter.\"\n\n-- JCN paid $1 million to a firm called Rigel Strategies for advertising, $752,000 to conservative PR firm Berman & Company for media services, $153,000 to the law firm Boyden Gray & Associates and $150,000 to the lobbying firm Mehlman Consulting for consulting, according to the filing. Job Creators Network, which has received $550,000 in contributions from the Leonard Leo-linked nonprofits The 85 Fund and Concord Fund over the past three years, also paid Leo's for-profit consulting firm CRC Advisors $288,000, according to the filing.\n\n-- Meanwhile the group's lone grant recipient listed on the filings appears to have little to do with issues of entrepreneurship or its student loan relief undertaking. The filing shows Job Creators Network wrote a $60,000 check last year to the Alan Dershowitz Legal Defense Trust, the legal defense fund set up to help famed legal scholar Alan Dershowitz defray the costs of a defamation lawsuit filed by an alleged Jeffrey Epstein victim and Dershowitz's own, since-dismissed defamation lawsuit against CNN.\n\n-- More curious spending on the report discloses that JCN spent an unspecified amount on a \"health club\" membership and personal trainers for the group's CEO Alfredo Ortiz. The group also reported spending more than $62,000 at the members-only Capitol Hill Club for fundraising and program expenses. \"Our 990's speak for themselves and we have no additional comments,\" JCN chief communications officer Elaine Parker told PI in a statement.\n\n-- \"It's no surprise that the group leading the charge against student debt forgiveness for Americans spent the rest of its time bankrolling extreme causes and facilitating Leo's circular profit scheme,\" Accountable.US President Caroline Ciccone said in a statement, referencing the D.C. attorney general's investigation into Leo's network.\n\n-- JCN Foundation, the entity that filed one of the two lawsuits that ultimately resulted in the Supreme Court striking down Biden's student loan relief, brought in nearly $4.3 million in revenues last year, up from $2.9 million the year before, according to a copy of its tax return that was filed over the summer. The foundation reported spending $3.7 million on programs similar to that of its 501(c)(4) arm, with the addition of $340,000 to seed its new legal action fund.\n\n-- The nonprofit paid conservative law firm Consovoy McCarthy, which represented the two plaintiffs in the student loan case, $225,000 for legal fees, according to the tax filing. But among the group's largest expenditures last year was $500,000 JCN Foundation paid to Mr. 305 Inc., Miami rapper Pitbull's record label, for a \"public education project.\" It was not immediately clear what that project was.\n\n-- At a summit in Miami Beach in March with the head of the Saudi sovereign wealth fund, and \"using his public office, including the city seal, Suarez gave the Saudi regime what it wanted: a public relations boost at a time when it was seeking to spread its influence around the globe and brand itself 'a force for good.' As a bonus, he was also able to significantly benefit a major client of the international law firm that pays him more than $1 million a year,\" Quinn Emanuel Urquhart & Sullivan.\n\n-- \"Internal communications and planning documents obtained as part of the Miami Herald's investigation into Miami City Hall show the extent to which Suarez put himself and his public office at the service of the Saudis.\"\n\n-- \"He was provided a lengthy roster of tycoons and celebrities that the Saudis wanted invited -- ranging from Marc Anthony to Shakira -- as well as a list of which sessions the mayor needed to attend, when he should show up and what talking points he should follow. Although it wasn't obvious from glossy advertisements ... the Florida summit was part of Saudi Arabia's subtle, multifaceted campaign, to use the investment power of its oil-soaked sovereign wealth fund to diversify and grow its economy, buff over the regime's bloody reputation and recast the nation as a leader in sustainability, innovation and progress.\"\n\n-- \"Now, the Miami summit is caught up in an ongoing congressional investigation into how Saudi Arabia has bought its way into popular U.S. institutions and used them to reshape the public narrative in the United States.\"\n\nFIRST IN PI: Sen. Kyrsten Sinema (I-Ariz.), who has been criticized by Democrats for her ties to and help for Wall Street, accepted a $750 donation from an Arizona man months after he pled guilty to a felony charge of stock manipulation, specifically selling unregistered securities, Daniel reports.\n\n-- Ira Gaines was sentenced to 60 months probation in June for the crime and paid almost $100,000 in restitution to the victims of the scheme in addition to a $10,000 fine. He donated the $750 on Sept. 15. A spokesperson for Sinema didn't respond to requests for comment or whether she would return the funds. Gaines also didn't respond to a request for comment.\n\nWARREN'S LATEST CRYPTO CRUSADE: \"Sen. Elizabeth Warren has a new target as she takes on the cryptocurrency industry: Its growing army of former defense, national security and law enforcement officials,\" our Zach Warmbrodt reports.\n\n-- \"The Massachusetts Democrat sent letters to Coinbase, the largest U.S. crypto exchange, as well as the Blockchain Association and Coin Center, two leading industry groups, demanding details on their employment of the former officials,\" which she described as an \"abuse of the revolving door\" designed to give the industry \"a veneer of legitimacy while fighting tooth and nail to stonewall common sense rules designed to restrict the use of crypto for terror financing -- rules that could cut into crypto company profits.\"\n\n-- \"Warren cited POLITICO reporting that outlined how the crypto lobby has been flexing its association with the experts as it faces growing scrutiny for the role digital assets play in facilitating financial crime, including funding the Oct. 7 Hamas attacks in Israel.\"\n\n-- \"Warren's letters identified Coinbase's recruitment of one-time Defense Secretary Mark Esper and Bush counterterrorism adviser Frances Townsend, as well as retired Republican Sen. Pat Toomey and former Democratic Reps. Tim Ryan and Sean Patrick Maloney, who is nominated to serve as the U.S. representative to the OECD.\"\n\n-- \"They serve on Coinbase's Global Advisory Council. She also noted a recent Blockchain Association letter to Capitol Hill signed by 40 former military officials, ex-intelligence officers and national security professionals, who downplayed illicit activity in crypto and argued against policies that would drive digital asset players overseas.\"\n\nIF YOU MISSED IT MONDAY: \"A watchdog group that has already filed several complaints against Gov. Ron DeSantis is now alleging that the Florida Republican and a super PAC aiding his presidential bid violated federal campaign finance laws,\" our Gary Fineout reports.\n\n-- \"DeSantis' reliance on Never Back Down, which was set up with an infusion of more than $80 million transferred from a committee that once was raising money for the governor's 2022 reelection campaign, has already generated a lot of questions and scrutiny.\"\n\n-- Now, campaign finance watchdog Campaign Legal Center \"wants federal election regulators to look at whether Never Back Down, which has been in turmoil lately amid a rash of firings and departures of top staff, including top strategist Jeff Roe, worked hand-in-hand with the DeSantis campaign despite federal laws that prohibit coordination between the two.\"\n\n-- \"When a super PAC like Never Back Down illegally coordinates its election spending with a candidate's campaign, the super PAC effectively becomes an arm of the campaign,\" Saurav Ghosh, director of federal campaign finance reform at Campaign Legal Center said in a statement. \"That circumvents federal contribution limits and reporting requirements, and gives the super PAC's special interest backers, including corporations and ultra-wealthy individuals, a concerning level of influence over elected officials and policymaking -- undermining voters' right to a meaningful and equitable role in the democratic process.\"\n\n-- Kia Kolderup-Lane has joined Salesforce as senior manager of state and local government affairs for California and the Southwest.

        "title": "Oscar Volley: Which Foreign Films Will Voters Choose for Best International Feature? - Blog - The Film Experience",
        "body": "Before we get the shortlist on Thursday, here's today's volley, on Best International Feature, from Elisa Giudici and Abe Friedtanzer...\n\nTHE ZONE OF INTEREST feels like a lock in this race.\n\nABE: Hi Elisa! I'm excited to talk about one of my favorite categories, Best International Feature! This year we have 88 submissions from all around the world. While I'm still hoping to catch more in the next few weeks, I think I've managed to track down a good number of the top contenders. Interestingly, this year's likely frontrunner is from a country that rarely gets noticed, in part because most of its films simply aren't eligible. That would be the United Kingdom, which has quite an intense feature in The Zone of Interest, a haunting portrait of the commandant of Auschwitz and his family, who live right next to the infamous concentration camp but live quite the serene life...\n\nI think that's the surest bet. Next up would have been Anatomy of a Fall, also starring Sandra Hüller, and while that may end up scoring a Best Picture nomination, France opted instead to submit The Taste of Things, starring Oscar winner Juliette Binoche. I don't think that tasty feast is a lock for a nomination, but it's likely to make the shortlist. What are some of the other top contenders you're anticipating?\n\nELISA: For sure, my top pick category as well! It's basically the Eurovision of cinematic prizes - everyone picks their movie, and then it's all-out war. This year, the analogy is even more spot-on, given that the competition looks even more Europe-centric than usual. It's like countries vying for the top spot, but with movies, and I'm here for it!\n\nEver since Cannes, Glazer's film seemed not just a front-runner but almost a guaranteed winner. I even heard from someone in the industry that A24 thought it could nab seven nominations - that's quite the confidence! So, I think it's locked, but there are some strong contenders rising up.\n\nDid France make a mistake by submitting THE TASTE OF THINGS instead of ANATOMY OF A FALL?\n\nDon't sleep on the French submission just because of the controversy around the movie choice. The Taste of Things is a superb film, different from Anatomy of a Fall but maybe even closer to the Academy's traditional tastes. Political issues aside, it's a tough call between the two, and the controversy might even benefit Triet's movie in the bigger category - good for both! Finland's Fallen Leaves is another strong contender on the tender side...maybe one can rule out the other?\n\nThen there are films settled far from Europe but still European entries, and the reverse too: German director Wim Wender's Perfect Days in Japan and Spain's Society of the Snow set in Chile. Both are really good and quite palatable for general audiences. The first plays on the perception of Japanese culture as super efficient yet still connected to the human factor, with a stellar performance from the protagonist already praised in Cannes. The second is a tour de force in a controversial real story, told from a sympathetic point of view, rejecting the morbidity some previous adaptations lingered in while not censoring the harsher parts. I think it could be this year's little Nothing New From the Western Front, eyeing some technical nominations.\n\nGermany's The Teachers' Lounge is considered a strong contender, although I haven't seen it yet. Have you? Do you think this year's ballot could be all European? It's shaping up to be quite the continental showdown!\n\nGermany's THE TEACHERS' LOUNGE is an impressive submission.\n\nABE: I did see The Teachers' Lounge recently and was very impressed - I think it will make the shortlist for sure. And Fallen Leaves got a big boost from its unexpected Golden Globe nomination for star Alma Pöysti, though we know that some Globe-honored films, like In the Fade, don't translate to the Oscar list.\n\nI want to mention a film I hope will make the list but I'm not entirely confident, and that's Shayda. It's Australia's submission and features the star of a shortlisted Danish submission from last year, Holy Spider. Zar Amir Ebrahiim is absolutely terrific, and the film has been winning raves since it debuted at Sundance last year. I just hope it will go far and continue to net attention.\n\nOn the note of Denmark, regular International Feature star Mads Mikkelsen is quite good in The Promised Land, which I fully expect to show up on the shortlist. It's somewhat similar to - but not nearly as dark as - another entry this year, The Settlers, from Chile. That's another film that's been making the festival circuit and which I worry has been underseen.\n\nIf Europe doesn't dominate, I think Concrete Utopia has a good chance of getting nominated, though I worry that Parasite will inexplicably remain the only South Korean film ever nominated in this category after the surprising snub of Decision to Leave last year.\n\nTHE PROMISED LAND could benefit from the Academy's Danish obsession.\n\nI have a few hopefuls that I don't expect to get nominated or shortlisted but would love to see considered. Before we get there, are we missing any other major contenders?\n\nELISA: Back in early September, hanging out in Venice, I was totally sold on The Promised Land being the big shot for an Oscar nod. But, hey, maybe I was a tad too sure of myself? Denmark's no slouch, though, with its solid history of nominations, even if it's not stealing the show.\n\nWe might've overlooked the Italian entry, Io capitano. I mean, seeing it in the final five at the Golden Globes was a genuine jaw-dropper. So, who knows, maybe it could squeeze into the longlist? It might not be Garrone's magnum opus, but it throws in some magical realism and a legit African viewpoint into a gritty migration tale -- guaranteed drama.\n\nIf the competition wasn't so cutthroat, I'd easily bet on it for the top five. Still, it would be a real win for this flick to snag a spot. Hitting the Golden Globes list and getting a shout-out in Venice, I'm thinking it deserves a longlist nod, but honestly, I'd be pretty darn surprised.\n\nNow, onto the underdogs we're rooting for in this convo. Let's shine a light on City of Wind from Mongolia -- a cool coming-of-age story about a young Shaman teenager. Directed by a woman who seems to have more tricks up her sleeve than her debut lets on. Total hidden gem!\n\nMongolia's CITY OF WIND is a hidden gem.\n\nABE: I haven't had a chance to see that one. The two that I wish had more of a shot are also both directed by women! Slow from Lithuania and Seven Blessings from Israel are both extraordinary stories of complicated relationships. Slow looks at a couple developing feelings for each other while one of them is asexual, and Seven Blessings navigates the intense dynamics of a group of adult siblings and their mother. I'd love to see either one make a surprise showing on the shortlist.\n\nWhat are your 15 predicted films to make the shortlist?\n\nELISA: Predicting the longlist feels like navigating a field of numerous strong contenders, making it more about ruling titles out than confidently placing them in. However, I'm up for the challenge of forecasting both the long and shortlists.\n\nHere's my breakdown of the longlist into sure bets and titles I think will likely make it but aren't guaranteed.\n\nNow, let's tackle the challenging part and attempt to guess the final ballot if you're up for it!\n\nFOUR DAUGHTERS could be the second Kaouther Ben Hania film to score a nomination.\n\nABE: Here's my predicted shortlist, which isn't that different from yours, in order of likelihood:\n\nMy predicted nominees:\n\nELISA: I would go with the same final five but with Japan in, Australia out. Readers, what films are we overestimating or underestimating?",

        "body": "Did you enthusiastically agree to and then completely forget about your friend's white elephant gift exchange? Are you scrambling to find a meaningful present for your significant other that doesn't reek of capitalist excess? Need a fittingly thoughtful birthday gift for your favorite Capricorn?\n\nWe've been there! That's why we've compiled a list of artsy and crafty gifts from some of our favorite creators, from rug-tufted art to quirky ceramics. Peruse our picks below -- and a reminder that a Hyperallergic membership never goes out of style! 😉 -- Valentina Di Liscia, News Editor\n\nTiny cats perched in petite armchairs, lounging bunnies gripping single flower stems, and a pair of Elton John-style sunglasses sized for a mouse are among Chilean ceramicist and illustrator Milo Hachim's charming array of offerings. The artist handshapes and handpaints her creations, which are infused with a decidedly childlike wonder. Most objects are under $50; visit the store here. -- Elaine Velie, Staff Writer\n\nPortland, Oregon-based artist Ali Cat creates prints, jewelry, and tapestries that incorporate plantlife motifs while speaking to the urgency of cultural and political movements. Her vibrant pen- and ink-drawn \"Palestinian Land Print\" (2023), commemorating the annual March 30 celebration of Land Day, is now being sold to benefit Palestine Legal, an organization that works to protect the rights of people who speak in support of Palestinian freedom. Cat's screenprint speaks to the visual language of Palestinian resistance, featuring bright-red poppies and green olive leaves framed by the words \"Liberate\" and \"Return.\" The nine-by-nine-inch print costs $30 and can be purchased here. -- EV\n\n\"Making prints is a way to bring a little bit of art to people who wouldn't normally buy it,\" New York-based artist Ruth Rodriguez told Hyperallergic. She makes deeply personal works, layering images such as photocopies of a lover's clothing with brightly colored figures to probe the experiences of womanhood. \"I wanted something that had a representation of my Dominican American culture, something funny and cute that was relatable,\" Rodriguez said of her print series Cafecito Por Favor. \"A lot of the women I draw are in their underpants or relaxing on the couch. I want to make my work feel familiar in an art space where it is often easy to feel intimidated.\" Each print costs $25 and can be purchased here; the artist also sells handmade $5 holiday cards. -- EV\n\nMultidisciplinary artist Daisy Tortuga makes everything from sculptural glassware to mohair bonnets. Her imagery and style can appear irreverent -- as evidenced in Christmas tree ornaments of ceramic cigarettes with satin and velvet bows -- but her work also conveys something deeper. In tufted rugs and clay works, Tortuga evokes eerily familiar yet perennially unnamed feelings of womanhood. Available items range from £15 (~$19) to £500 ($636). -- EV\n\nAs her shop name betrays, Brooklyn-based artist Michele Mirisola found a delightful niche in making ceramics using real sea shells, which she adorns with delicately placed strings of air-dried clay that look like piped icing. Mirisola turns conches into wine stoppers, scallops into collect-alls, and oysters into salt dishes (complete with a viscous-looking clump of resin at the bottom). The artist also creates larger pieces, such as intricately tiled mosaics and appetizer trays that could easily outshine the food they serve. Prices range from $45 to $1,700; shop here. -- EV\n\nJori Brennon, a queer Two Spirit Cree artist based in Canada, creates intricately patterned beadwork featuring traditional motifs on a wide range of forms. Current offerings include an orange, yellow, and green bolo tie; cuff bracelets adorned with the silhouettes of buffalo; and shimmering red and gold heart earrings that Brennon says \"sparkle like nobody's business.\" Prices range from $115 for earrings to $1,143 for beaded cuffs; shop the artist's store here. -- EV\n\nSkye Tafoya comes from a long line of basket weavers from the Eastern Band Cherokee and Santa Clara Pueblo Tribes, and the multidisciplinary artist continues the tradition through her paper-making and weaving practice. Tafoya's carefully arranged artworks have a vibrant and sometimes even psychedelic appearance, and are always mind-bogglingly detailed. For a more affordable option, the artist also creates prints. These are available from $90, and weavings sell for up to $1,700. -- EV\n\nUkraine-born, Missouri-based artist Larysa Bernhardt reuses vintage tapestries to craft hand-sewn moth sculptures that honor the embroidery techniques passed on by her mother. Outfitted with wired wings; shrouded in velvet, silk, and Belgian linen; and finished with glass beads, the uncanny yet elegant pieces can be placed decoratively on a surface or hung on the wall to cause a buzz among artsy house guests. Prices online range from $215 to $600; inquire here for availability. -- VD\n\nWith two storefront locations in the suburbs of southwest Chicago and Amman, Jordan, and bolstered by an online shop, Watan Palestine is a heritage-based art studio and business focused on empowering Palestinian Americans to creatively learn about their identity, cultural heritage, and history beyond a foreign lens. Through prints and posters, home decor, apparel and accessories, and stationery and stickers, Watan provides a multitude of avenues that familiarize and celebrate Palestinian culture and advocacy within the diaspora. Naturally, our top picks are of the \"Catffiyeh\" variety, but there are plenty of beautiful design tributes to Palestine to choose from. Prices vary; shop here. -- Rhea Nayyar, Staff Writer\n\nIn Marion Kadi's inventive portraits, familiar faces emerge from abstract patterning and imaginary scenes. Her subjects can be seen leaving from a lamp as a genie and heading a dinner table propped up by human legs. Kadi also takes commissions for eight-by-10-inch pet portraits: Interested parents can send her a few of their favorite animal photos and the artist will render them faithfully. \"I take some liberties with the colors and I invent a background,\" the artist told Hyperallergic, but promises to capture the pet's expression \"precisely.\" In a work completed earlier this year, Polina the cat lies majestically on a yellow-hued bluff casting her gaze at the passing ships below. Pet portraits cost $200 plus shipping; inquire here. -- EV",

        "title": "Jewish Groups Line Up In Support Of Biden's Muslim Court Pick Assailed By GOP",
        "body": "Fifteen Jewish organizations on Tuesday pledged their \"strong support\" for President Joe Biden's historic Muslim court pick Adeel Mangi -- days after Republican senators subjected him to hostile and Islamophobic questioning in his confirmation hearing.\n\n\"Having ethical and unbiased judges is ingrained in our Jewish teachings in which we are taught that 'judges need to be people of strength through good deeds,'\" reads the groups' letter to all 100 senators, obtained by HuffPost. \"It is clear to us that Adeel A. Mangi is a person of strength and good deeds, as evidenced by his career, devotion to his community, and commitment to religious freedom and civil rights.\"\n\nThe letter hails Mangi's legal record and his pro bono work on behalf of religious organizations. It also highlights the numerous amicus briefs he has filed in federal courts on behalf of religious communities relating to LGBTQ rights, unlawful surveillance of religious communities and the repeal of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\n\n\"It's important that people of faith have a voice on many of the critical issues that are before the Supreme Court and the appellate courts,\" said the organizations. \"There's something beautiful about ... more than 150 different religious groups coming together to present a common position to the Supreme Court of the United States.\"\n\nThe letter is signed by the National Council of Jewish Women, Bend the Arc: Jewish Action, Carolina Jews for Justice, The Shalom Center, and others. The groups collectively represent more than a million people nationwide.\n\nMangi, if confirmed, will be the nation's first-ever Muslim federal appeals court judge, and only the third Muslim federal judge. Biden tapped Mangi for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit, based in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Jewish groups' letter comes after Mangi, who is a partner at Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler LLP, endured a series of offensive and irrelevant questions from Republicans in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.\n\nGOP Sens. Ted Cruz (Texas), Tom Cotton (Ark.) and Josh Hawley (Mo.) yelled at and interrupted Mangi throughout his hearing. They demanded that he share his personal views on the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the Oct. 7 attack in Israel and the Israeli-Hamas conflict in general. They also repeatedly tried to tie him to pro-Palestinian comments made by people he didn't know, and to events he didn't know about.\n\nMangi repeatedly had to attest that he wasn't antisemitic or sympathetic to terrorists.\n\nCruz, for one, specifically pressed Mangi to say whether he sees any justification for the Hamas militants' terrorist attack in Israel that left some 1,200 Israelis dead.\n\n\"I have no patience -- none -- for any attempts to justify or defend those events,\" Mangi replied.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's judicial nominee Adeel Mangi testifies during his Senate confirmation hearing on Dec. 13.\n\nDemocrats on the committee later condemned Republicans for their treatment of Biden's judicial pick, including chairman Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), who banged his gavel several times in response to Cruz repeatedly interrupting Mangi.\n\nOn Friday, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the largest Muslim civil rights organization in the country, condemned all three Republican senators for their behavior.\n\n\"Singling out a Muslim judicial nominee and forcing him to answer 'gotcha questions' about the Middle East simply because of faith or because of his tangential connections to Muslims who comment on the Middle East is Islamophobic and un-American,\" said Edward Ahmed Mitchell, CAIR's national deputy director. \"So is raising the hateful trope that presumptively assumes that Muslims are antisemitic.\"",

        "title": "Jewish Groups Line Up In Support Of Biden's Muslim Court Pick Assailed By GOP",
        "body": "Fifteen Jewish organizations on Tuesday pledged their \"strong support\" for President Joe Biden's historic Muslim court pick Adeel Mangi -- days after Republican senators subjected him to hostile and Islamophobic questioning in his confirmation hearing.\n\n\"Having ethical and unbiased judges is ingrained in our Jewish teachings in which we are taught that 'judges need to be people of strength through good deeds,'\" reads the groups' letter to all 100 senators, obtained by HuffPost. \"It is clear to us that Adeel A. Mangi is a person of strength and good deeds, as evidenced by his career, devotion to his community, and commitment to religious freedom and civil rights.\"\n\nThe letter hails Mangi's legal record and his pro bono work on behalf of religious organizations. It also highlights the numerous amicus briefs he has filed in federal courts on behalf of religious communities relating to LGBTQ rights, unlawful surveillance of religious communities and the repeal of the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program.\n\n\"It's important that people of faith have a voice on many of the critical issues that are before the Supreme Court and the appellate courts,\" said the organizations. \"There's something beautiful about ... more than 150 different religious groups coming together to present a common position to the Supreme Court of the United States.\"\n\nThe letter is signed by the National Council of Jewish Women, Bend the Arc: Jewish Action, Carolina Jews for Justice, The Shalom Center, and others. The groups collectively represent more than a million people nationwide.\n\nMangi, if confirmed, will be the nation's first-ever Muslim federal appeals court judge, and only the third Muslim federal judge. Biden tapped Mangi for a seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the 3rd Circuit, based in Philadelphia.\n\nThe Jewish groups' letter comes after Mangi, who is a partner at Patterson Belknap Webb & Tyler LLP, endured a series of offensive and irrelevant questions from Republicans in the Senate Judiciary Committee on Wednesday.\n\nGOP Sens. Ted Cruz (Texas), Tom Cotton (Ark.) and Josh Hawley (Mo.) yelled at and interrupted Mangi throughout his hearing. They demanded that he share his personal views on the Sept. 11 terrorist attacks, the Oct. 7 attack in Israel and the Israeli-Hamas conflict in general. They also repeatedly tried to tie him to pro-Palestinian comments made by people he didn't know, and to events he didn't know about.\n\nMangi repeatedly had to attest that he wasn't antisemitic or sympathetic to terrorists.\n\nCruz, for one, specifically pressed Mangi to say whether he sees any justification for the Hamas militants' terrorist attack in Israel that left some 1,200 Israelis dead.\n\n\"I have no patience -- none -- for any attempts to justify or defend those events,\" Mangi replied.\n\nPresident Joe Biden's judicial nominee Adeel Mangi testifies during his Senate confirmation hearing on Dec. 13.\n\nDemocrats on the committee later condemned Republicans for their treatment of Biden's judicial pick, including chairman Dick Durbin (D-Ill.), who banged his gavel several times in response to Cruz repeatedly interrupting Mangi.\n\nOn Friday, the Council on American-Islamic Relations, the largest Muslim civil rights organization in the country, condemned all three Republican senators for their behavior.\n\n\"Singling out a Muslim judicial nominee and forcing him to answer 'gotcha questions' about the Middle East simply because of faith or because of his tangential connections to Muslims who comment on the Middle East is Islamophobic and un-American,\" said Edward Ahmed Mitchell, CAIR's national deputy director. \"So is raising the hateful trope that presumptively assumes that Muslims are antisemitic.\"\n\nMangi's nomination isn't going anywhere soon. The Senate is about to recess for the holidays and isn't expected back until Jan. 8. After that, it's up to Durbin to decide when to schedule a committee vote on Mangi's nomination.",

        "title": "Enerpac Tool Group Reports First Quarter Fiscal 2024 Results and Affirms Full-Year Guidance",
        "body": "First Quarter of Fiscal 2024 Continuing Operations Highlights*\n\n*This press release contains financial measures in accordance with U.S. Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (âGAAPâ) in addition to non-GAAP financial measures. Reconciliations of the non-GAAP financial measures to the comparable GAAP measures are presented in the tables accompanying this release.\n\n**Organic growth, formerly referred to as core growth, represents revenue growth excluding the impact of foreign exchange rates, acquisitions, and divestitures. A reconciliation of organic sales growth to the comparable net sales growth is presented in the tables accompanying this release.\n\nMILWAUKEE--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Enerpac Tool Group Corp. (NYSE: EPAC) today announced results for its fiscal first quarter ended November 30, 2023.\n\nâWe began fiscal 2024 with another good quarter, underscored by solid top-line growth and greatly expanded profitability,â said Paul Sternlieb, Enerpac Tool Groupâs President & CEO. âWhile we maintain a cautious tone regarding full-year results, given economic and geopolitical uncertainty, our performance demonstrates the continued benefits of Enerpacâs ASCEND transformation program, four-pillar growth strategy, and the permanent changes across the organization that are making Enerpac more efficient, more productive, and easier to do business with.â\n\nFirst Quarter Fiscal 2024 Consolidated Results Comparisons\n\nâFirst quarter gains in operating profit and margins reflect the success of our transformational initiatives that enhance productivity and efficiency at the gross profit and SG&A lines,â stated Tony Colucci, Executive Vice President and Chief Financial Officer. âAdditionally, reported results reflect lower ASCEND-related charges.â\n\nConsolidated net sales for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 were $142.0 million compared to $139.4 million in the prior-year period, an increase of 1.9%. Organic sales, excluding the disposition of Cortland Industrial and the impact of foreign currency, increased 5.5% year-over-year, with product sales up 4.2% and service revenues ahead 10.1%. Net sales growth for the Industrial Tools & Services (IT&S) reportable segment of 7.6%, with organic growth of 5.8%, was partly offset by a year-over-year decline at Cortland Biomedical, which comprises the Other operating segment.\n\nGross margin expanded approximately 360 basis points year-over-year to 52.3%, driven by operational improvements related to ASCEND, favorable sales mix, volume leverage, carryover price increases from fiscal 2023, and the disposition of Cortland Industrial. Selling, general and administrative expenses of $44.6 million were $9.6 million lower year-over-year. Adjusted SG&A was 29.0% of sales, down from 31.2% of sales in the year-ago period.\n\nOperating profit increased 133% year-over-year to $28.7 million, with an operating profit margin of 20.2%, up from 8.8% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023. Adjusted operating profit increased 40% to $32.4 million, with an adjusted operating margin of 22.8%, a 620 basis point expansion over the prior-year period.\n\nFirst quarter fiscal 2024 net earnings and diluted EPS were $18.3 million and $0.33 respectively, compared to $6.4 million and $0.11, respectively, in the year-ago period.\n\nFirst quarter adjusted EBITDA was $34.9 million compared to $26.6 million in the year-ago period, achieving an adjusted EBITDA margin of 24.6%, up 550 basis points from 19.1% in the first quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nNet cash used by operating activities was $6.7 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 as compared to $17.5 million of cash provided by operations in the prior-year period. The decrease in cash from operations was primarily due to the timing of annual incentive compensation payments along with payments made for the ASCEND transformation program. In fiscal 2023, the annual incentive compensation payment was recorded in the second quarter.\n\nIT&S Results Comparisons\n\nFirst quarter fiscal 2024 net sales for IT&S were $137.0 million, ahead 7.6% year-over-year with organic growth of 5.8%. Organic growth was driven by a 4.5% increase in product sales and a 10.1% increase in service revenues. The segmentâs operating profit margin increased 510 basis points to 26.0% and adjusted operating profit margin improved 520 basis points to 28.1%.\n\nCorporate Expenses from Continuing Operations\n\nCorporate expenses were $8.9 million and $15.8 million for the first quarter of fiscal 2024 and fiscal 2023, respectively. The year-over-year decline was driven by significantly lower ASCEND-related charges during the quarter. Adjusted corporate expenses(2) of $8.1 million for the first quarter increased $0.7 million compared to the prior year, as a result of higher incentive compensation.\n\nNet debt at November 30, 2023, was $96.5 million, resulting in a net debt to adjusted EBITDA ratio of 0.9x. The Company repurchased approximately one million shares of its common stock in the first quarter of fiscal 2024 for $26 million under its share repurchase program announced in March 2022.\n\nOutlook\n\nâWith the solid start to fiscal 2024, we are on track to achieve our full-year financial objectives,â concluded Sternlieb.\n\nAs such, the Company affirms its fiscal 2024 guidance, projecting a net sales range of $590 million to $605 million. The forecast anticipates organic growth of approximately 2% to 4%, with expected adjusted EBITDA in the range of $142 million to $152 million, and free cash flow between $60 million to $70 million. This forecast is based on key foreign exchange rate assumptions and assumes the absence of a broad-based global recession. The key foreign exchange rates and other guidance assumptions are included in the presentation materials accompanying the earnings webcast.\n\nConference Call Information\n\nAn investor conference call is scheduled for 7:30 am CT on December 20, 2023. Webcast information and conference call materials, including an earnings presentation, are available on the Enerpac Tool Group company website (www.enerpactoolgroup.com).\n\nSafe Harbor Statement\n\nCertain of the above comments represent forward-looking statements made pursuant to the provisions of the Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 1995.

Kennedy International Airport (JFK), Newark Liberty International Airport (EWR), Boston Logan Airport (BOS), Los Angeles International Airport (LAX), Miami International Airport (MIA), and Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport (FLL). In turn, when Delta resumes flying to Tel Aviv, they will add El Al's code to inbound flights to JFK, Boston, and Los Angeles, as well as an additional 280 flights across the United States.\n\nIn addition, members of both airlines loyalty programs will have the ability to earn and redeem miles on each other's airlines. Delta SkyMiles flyers can earn miles or use them for flights aboard El Al, while El Al Matmid members can earn points when flying aboard Delta flights.\n\n\"Delta remains steadfast in our long-time commitment to serving consumers and businesses who depend on convenient, high-quality air service to and from Tel Aviv,\" Alain Bellemare, president of international at Delta, said in a press release. \"Through our codeshare agreement with EL AL, we will offer customers more convenient travel options between North America and Israel.\"\n\nThe move comes as all three legacy U.S. carriers paused international flights to Israel amid the war with Hamas. Delta initially cancelled their schedule to Tel Aviv at the beginning of October 2023, and has not yet announced when they may continue flights to the nation.",

        "title": "Patrick Mahomes Signs With Logan Paul-Backed PRIME Drink Company: Why This Could Be Bad News For Coca-Cola And Pepsi - Celsius Holdings (NASDAQ:CELH), Keurig Dr Pepper (NASDAQ:KDP)",
        "body": "PRIME has endorsement deals with several athletes and professional sports teams with a new addition signed this week.\n\nSports and energy drink brand PRIME continues to see strong growth. The addition of another key athlete to its endorsement library could strengthen the brand going forward, putting concern on Coca-Cola Inc KO and PepsiCo PEP -- two companies that have dominated the sports drink market for many years.\n\nWhat Happened: One month after announcing the company hit one billion lifetime units sold, PRIME is back with another company announcement that could show off its strong growth profile and competition to legacy beverage companies.\n\nOn Monday, PRIME announced it has signed Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes as one of the company's PRIME Hydration Athletes.\n\n\"As a PRIME athlete, Mahomes will collaborate with the brand's team across social media, special events, charitable activations and more,\" the company said.\n\nMahomes is one of the top players in the NFL, winner of two Super Bowls, two Super Bowl MVPs and two regular season MVP awards in his short career.\n\n\"PRIME is a disruptive brand that has taken over the beverage industry since its first launched. They are gamechangers, and that's exactly what I strive to be on the field,\" Mahomes said. \"Our partnership is a winning play, merging innovation and excellence, setting a new standard both on and off the field.\"\n\nPRIME was launched in January 2022 by popular YouTubers Logan Paul and KSI. The brand has become one of the fastest-growing beverage brands.\n\n\"It's a privilege to welcome Patrick Mahomes to the PRIME family and we can't wait for you to see what we have planned in 2024,\" Paul and KSI said.\n\nRelated Link: 5 Things You Might Not Know About Kansas City Chiefs QB Patrick Mahomes\n\nWhy It's Important: The addition of Mahomes to the brand adds to a lineup that includes soccer star Erling Haaland (Manchester City), NHL star Auston Matthews (Toronto Maple Leafs) and several UFC fighters like Alexander Volkanovski and Israel Adesanya.\n\nPRIME also has deals in place with the UFC, soccer teams Arsenal, FC Barcelona and Bayern Munich and MLB team the Los Angeles Dodgers.\n\nIn its first year, PRIME hit $250 million in retail sales. The company has hit $1.2 billion in internal sales through the end of 2023. Key retail stores like Target, GNC, Kroger and Walmart carry the brand.\n\nIts caffeinated beverage, PRIME Energy, launched in 2023.\n\nPRIME competes with Coca-Cola and Pepsi in both sports drinks and energy drinks. Coca-Cola owns the Powerade, BodyArmor and Vitamin Water brands. It also has a strong position in the energy drink sector, thanks to its equity stake and distribution of Monster Beverage MNST.\n\nPepsiCo owns Gatorade, which dominates the sports drink market. It also made a major investment in fast-growing energy drink brand Celsius Holdings CELH.\n\nData shared by Darren Rovell shows PRIME with growth outpacing the beverage giants. Here's a look at the last 52 week sales of top sports drink brands through Oct. 8, 2023.\n\nThe data above could show why Coca-Cola and Pepsi should be worried about the growth of PRIME. Electrolit, which also showed double-digit growth, entered into a distribution deal with Keurig Dr Pepper Inc KDP in October. The deal could provide a further boost for the brand.\n\nMahomes' teaming up with PRIME could be a touchdown for the drink brand. It may also put further pressure on Coca-Cola and Pepsi moving forward.",

        "body": "LOS ANGELES -- As a lively group of elderly women scurried onto a shuttle for a shopping day on a recent Tuesday afternoon, Carla and Jack Weingarten could be found snuggled under a blanket inside their Los Angeles apartment, watching \"I Love Lucy\" episodes on repeat.\n\nCarla, who's 100, and Jack, who turns 105 on Dec. 25, used to look forward to their retirement community's weekly outings. But these days, they prefer a more laid-back afternoon: Sitting side by side in their recliner chairs and watching one of Carla's favorite shows -- Jack mostly just listens because he's lost much of his vision -- as they hold hands for hours.\n\nIn August, Carla and Jack celebrated a major milestone: 82 years of marriage.\n\n\"We're very lucky,\" said Carla, who has short-term memory loss. Then she leaned over toward her husband to encourage him to chime in.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he said in agreement, before kissing her hand tenderly. Jack, whose speech and memory have faded in recent years, used to tell their two sons that the key to a healthy marriage is \"the man always having the last word: 'Yes dear.'\" Jack doesn't talk much nowadays, but when he does, he's typically calling out for Carla or telling her that he loves her multiple times a day.\n\n\"I love you too, Jackie,\" she always responds.\n\nAn estimated 17,000 centenarians live in California, with nearly 6,500 of them in Los Angeles County, according to the California Department of Finance. That number gets even smaller -- roughly 25% as estimated by the Census Bureau's American Community Survey -- when it comes to how many Californians ages 90 and up are still married. According to the Guinness World Records, the longest documented marriage in the world is 86 years.\n\nIn other words, Carla and Jack's long-lasting relationship is somewhat of an anomaly.\n\nThe couple's Hollywood-like love story began in Vienna, where Jack and Carla had been neighbors and family friends since they were kids. Their families also attended the same synagogue, though they didn't pay much attention to each other due to their five-year age difference.\n\nThe family story goes like this: Around 1936, a teenage Jack moved to what was then known as Mandatory Palestine on the advice of a teacher because antisemitism was rapidly rising in Austria and neighboring Germany. Carla fled there a few years later during World War II. Her father thought she'd be safest there because she spoke Hebrew. He'd later be killed in a concentration camp, along with her mother, younger brother and grandparents. Before Carla left Austria, Jack's mother asked her to give him a letter. His mother didn't know exactly where he was living, but she hoped Carla would find him.\n\nSoon after she arrived, Carla ran into one of Jack's childhood friends, who told her where he was, and they reunited. Carla doesn't remember what she thought of Jack when she saw him again, but his reaction was laced with the charming sense of humor he's known for, according to their sons. \"You look a lot better now,\" Jack said to 17-year-old Carla. Knowing that she didn't have any family or resources at the time, Jack told her, \"Don't worry. I'll take care of you,\" and he suggested they get married.\n\nThey tied the knot on Aug. 12, 1941, and had their first son, Joel, four years later, then their second son, Henry, in 1950. The young family moved to New York City in 1958 and made their way to Los Angeles a few months later. Jack worked for a children's apparel company, which he eventually took over, while Carla worked as a seamstress and pattern maker. She also taught sewing classes in their garage.\n\n\"They struggled moving to America, but what I respected was that they never brought that to their children,\" said Joel. Unlike some of his friends' parents, Carla and Jack didn't remind him and his brother about the sacrifices they'd made for them, he added. \"I never heard anything from my parents about what they went through. They never looked back, they only looked forward.\"\n\nJack and Carla had a vibrant social life until a couple years ago. First, Jack hurt his head after two falls and had to recuperate during days-long hospital stays. Then he got COVID-19 and pneumonia. But before all that, Jack played bridge competitively for several years. He and Carla would go to every social event at their independent living community and encourage others to attend. If there was a dance floor, they were always on it. \"They're such a loved couple here,\" said Deborah Rivera, the community's business manager. She's known them since they moved into the retirement complex nearly 15 years ago.\n\nThe couple used to travel regularly to places like Hawaii, Austria and Germany, and they have friends of various ages around the world. They've outlived many of their longtime friends. Fluent in multiple languages, including German, Hebrew and French, they typically speak to each other in German.\n\nPhotos from their trips, along with smiling images of their sons, daughters-in-law and three granddaughters, adorn every square foot of their spacious two-bedroom apartment. Carla used to love making personalized cards on her desktop computer for her loved ones' birthdays, but she no longer does that these days.\n\n\"We're lucky,\" Carla said of their lives. \"We thank God. We have no complaints. We have a good place here. We enjoy being here with the people. We have good friends.\"\n\nCarla still exercises every day, and regularly gets her hair and nails done at the community's salon. And when her husband falls asleep in the evenings, she usually goes downstairs to catch up with her friends over a glass of wine. Three other centenarians live at the senior complex, but Carla and Jack are the only married couple, Rivera said.\n\nThe word \"tenderness\" comes to Rivera's mind when she thinks about the Weingartens. They have a \"spark of love that's still there after all these years,\" Rivera said. \"But with them, it's so pure. It's so genuine. You see that they truly just enjoy each other so much still. You see them walking down the hall, they're always holding hands, which is so sweet to see.\"\n\n\"I think that's what is keeping them alive,\" added their son, Joel. \"The fact they have each other.\"\n\nCarla and Jack's marriage has also made an impact on their three grandchildren.\n\n\"We all kind of look up to them as a success story and something to strive for because they do love each other so much and really do enjoy each other's company and waking up next to each other,\" said granddaughter Ashton Cohen-Weingarten, 33.\n\n\"They're so committed to each other,\" added her sister, 30-year-old Lindsay Cohen-Weingarten. \"They grew up together and now they've grown old together, and their relationship remains so strong. [Their marriage] has taught me unconditional love.\"\n\nWillie Coronado, one of Carla and Jack's caregivers, has also picked up a few gems from them. Jack told Coronado, who's been married for 23 years, that the secret to \"living happily ever after\" is making sure \"that when you go to bed at night with your wife, things are settled. Don't go to bed upset.\"\n\n\"That's something I keep with me all the time,\" said Coronado, who's worked with the couple for more than a decade. \"I know it's not easy, but I know he has so much wisdom in those words.\"\n\nBack in Carla and Jack's cozy apartment, Lucille Ball bounced on the TV screen in their living room. While a housekeeper tidied up their bedroom and a caretaker prepared their lunch, Jack began drifting off to sleep as he and his wife held hands. He didn't let go -- and neither did she.",

        "body": "Pope Francis permitted priests to bless same-sex couples, signifying a shift in the Catholic Church's approach toward LGBTQ parishioners, while also reinforcing the teaching that marriage is between a man and a woman.\n\nBlessings can now be given to same-sex couples in accordance with strict guidelines, the Vatican said in a declaration published on Dec. 18.\n\nThe declaration comes two years after the Vatican announced the Catholic Church cannot bless same-sex marriages.\n\n\"Francis' goal here is to get the Church out of the corner it painted itself into regarding same-sex couples in 2021, when it said God 'does not and cannot bless sin,'\" Vincent Miller, a theology professor at University of Dayton, told McClatchy News.\n\nThe declaration officially allows Catholic priests to provide blessings to \"couples in irregular situations and for couples of the same sex.\"\n\nPeople in \"irregular situations\" include those only in civil marriages or couples where at least one individual has been divorced, Bruce Morrill, a professor of theology at Vanderbilt University, told McClatchy News.\n\nThe declaration only allows priests to grant a certain type of blessing -- a form of prayer -- to these couples, Morill said.\n\nIt means that, rather than a \"ritual and liturgical\" blessing, priests can now confer a more informal and spontaneous type of blessing, Morill said.\n\n\"This isn't a formal blessing or recognition of their union, but blessing their desire that 'all that is true, good, and humanly valid in their lives and their relationships be enriched, healed, and elevated by the presence of the Holy Spirit,'\" Miller said.\n\nSuch blessings can only be given in certain circumstances, specifically at events that could not be conflated with marriage ceremonies or celebrations.\n\n\"This blessing should never be imparted in concurrence with the ceremonies of a civil union, and not even in connection with them,\" the declaration states. \"Nor can it be performed with any clothing, gestures, or words that are proper to a wedding.\"\n\nThe proper settings for such a blessing might include a meeting with a priest, pilgrimage or \"visit to a shrine.\"\n\n\"It is precisely in this context that one can understand the possibility of blessing couples in irregular situations and same-sex couples without officially validating their status or changing in any way the Church's perennial teaching on marriage,\" which is the \"indissoluble union between a man and a woman,\" the declaration states.\n\nIn stating that, the declaration \"goes out of its way to make very explicit that it is protecting what the church considers a sacred institution,\" Morill said.\n\nThe Vatican's declaration comes as the Catholic Church is attempting to carefully navigate the issue of same-sex marriage, which became legalized nationwide after a 2015 Supreme Court decision, Morrill said.\n\nThe church has to \"walk a fine line between what a lot of main-line protestant churches have done -- and that is to consecrate same-sex marriages -- and on the other hand, very strictly defending the Roman Catholic limit of marriage to heterosexual couples,\" Morill said.\n\nThe majority of American Catholics, 61%, favor legalized same-sex marriage, while 31% are opposed, according to a 2019 poll from the Pew Research Center. However, the poll did not survey respondents' views on the church's acceptance of same-sex marriage.\n\n\"It will be interesting to see how critics respond, how people pleased with this development respond, and how people who want the church to move toward actually allowing same-sex marriage respond,\" Catherine O'Donnell, a historian of Catholicism at the Arizona State University, told McClatchy News.\n\n\"The subtlety of this declaration could offer a temporary or even long-term compromise,\" O'Donnell said, \"or it could provoke more discontent.\"\n\nMultiple Catholic leaders across the U.S. have issued responses to Francis' declaration, including Bishop Robert McManus of the Diocese of Worcester, who emphasized the limits of the new guidelines.\n\n\"These blessings are offered for the people themselves, not their union,\" McManus said in a statement.\n\nBishop Oscar Cantú of the Diocese of San Jose also released a statement, saying, \"this declaration represents an important clarification that acknowledges and responds to the diverse realities of people's lives while upholding the Church's teachings on sacramental marriage.\"\n\nThe Vatican's declaration also comes as Catholic Church membership has fallen precipitously in the United States in recent decades, according to a 2021 Gallup survey.\n\n\"The church needs Catholics as much as Catholics need the church,\" O'Donnell said. \"The risk is that the former is more true than the latter.\"\n\nWhy is there a generational divide on Israel in the US?

        "title": "Editorial Roundup: United States",
        "body": "Excerpts from recent editorials in the United States and abroad:\n\nDec. 13\n\nThe Washington Post on the SCOTUS and Donald Trump\n\nThe essential moment in Jack Smith's 2020 election obstruction case against Donald Trump might have arrived -- and, oddly, the substance of the charges has nothing to do with it. The special counsel this week filed a motion asking the Supreme Court to speedily review the former president's claims that he is immune from prosecution, rather than allow an appeals court to do so first. The strategy is gutsy, but it might be necessary to get the case to trial before the general election -- and that is a wholly legitimate goal for Mr. Trump's prosecutor.\n\nMr. Smith has asked the justices to grant him what's known as certiorari before judgment. This is an extraordinary request, but the special counsel is hardly summoning a legal theory out of thin air. The Supreme Court has embraced the procedure in many cases involving national crises, including in United States v. Nixon, when President Richard M. Nixon refused to turn over his infamous audiotapes. That's because, as a long line of law recognizes, the public is as entitled to the fair administration of justice as anyone standing trial. Part of what makes this case extraordinary is Mr. Trump's unique potential to force a halt to the prosecution. Even when defendants use delay as a courtroom tactic, they typically still have to face prosecutors at some point.\n\nBy ignoring that timing in a case with the peaceful transition of power at its heart, the courts would allow themselves to be manipulated by a politician using his status as a candidate to avoid accountability. The gambit to prevent District Court Judge Tanya S. Chutkan from meeting a March 4 trial date, by appealing her rejection of Mr. Trump's immunity defense, is only the latest delay tactic by the Trump legal team. The former president's allies and his lawyers appear to believe his surest route to escaping accountability is to win reelection before a jury manages to convict him, then instructing the Justice Department to drop its cases. The Supreme Court would show that the justice system won't be tricked if, instead, the justices ensured the case is tried on the merits.\n\nThe merits, as it turns out, aren't too difficult to assess. A D.C. Circuit panel has already decided that a president's civil immunity for actions taken while in office is limited when those actions are taken not in the president's role as president, but in his role as a reelection seeker -- as when Mr. Trump gave his Jan. 6, 2021, speech urging supporters to march on the U.S. Capitol. The argument that a president is free from criminal liability during his tenure, meanwhile, has next to nothing to support it in doctrine or in history. There's a reason, after all, that Nixon required a pardon from Gerald Ford, and that Bill Clinton gave up his law license as part of a deal to avoid prosecution following his perjury scandal.\n\nThis makes sense: A president's duties will never require him to break the law, much less to do so intentionally. What's more, much of the conduct described in the indictment, such as pressuring electors to defect or urging Georgia Secretary of State Brad Raffensperger to \" find 11,780 votes \" cannot be construed to be inside the scope of the executive's official duties.\n\nMr. Trump also argues that charging him based on the same violations for which he was impeached by the House and acquitted by the Senate would constitute double jeopardy. Yet the Constitution's Impeachment Judgments clause says that if a president is convicted by the Senate, he can still be tried in a court of law. Reading this backward to suggest that if a president isn't convicted by the Senate, he can't be tried in a court of law defies common sense. The Framers clearly designed impeachment to serve a distinct purpose from prosecution.\n\nThe Supreme Court should grant the special counsel the speedy hearing he has asked for, because of the public interest in a decision that is quick, carefully considered and, crucially, final. If it does not the justices should at least instruct lower courts to move briskly, after which they should promptly choose once and for all whether to review the case. This procedural matter will swallow up the substance of the case unless the courts decide not to let it.\n\nONLINE: https://www.washingtonpost.com/opinions/2023/12/13/jack-smith-motion-supreme-court-trump/\n\nDec. 17\n\nThe Wall Street Journal on the IRA and rising drug costs\n\nPresident Biden keeps trying to persuade Americans his policies are helping them, but voters aren't buying it. The latest example is the Inflation Reduction Act's (IRA) Medicare drug rebates, which are raising the cost of medicines.\n\nThe White House on Thursday proclaimed that the IRA's drug rebates are already saving seniors money: \"President Biden's prescription drug law cracks down on price gouging from Big Pharma.\"\n\nUnder the IRA, drug makers must pay Medicare rebates if they raise list prices more than the rate of inflation. If a company increases the price of an immunotherapy by, say, 8% while inflation is increasing at 3%, it must pay Medicare the 5% difference. Co-insurance payments made by patients are then based on the inflation-adjusted price.\n\nRebates are deposited in the Medicare Supplementary Medical Insurance Fund, which is mainly financed by general tax revenue. In other words, politicians, not seniors, are the real beneficiary of the rebates.\n\nAccording to the Administration, IRA drug rebates save seniors \"as much as $618 per average dose on 47 prescription drugs\" (our emphasis). This is deceptive marketing. It's possible that Medicare co-insurance as a result of the IRA could be hundreds of dollars less on a cancer drug that costs tens of thousands of dollars per dose and whose list price increases by double digits. But most Medicare patients will see little benefit.\n\nOn the other hand, privately insured patients will likely pay much more for drugs owing to the rebates. Democrats tacitly conceded this when they drafted the law. They initially planned to apply the IRA inflation rebates to the private insurance market too. That's because employers worried that drug makers would offset the cost of the Medicare rebates by raising prices for their workers.\n\nThis is what has happened in Medicare with hospital and physician fees. Because Medicare typically pays less than the cost of care, providers charge privately insured patients more to compensate. Private health plans paid hospitals 224% of Medicare rates in 2020, according to a Rand Corp. study. Between 2013 and 2018, prices paid to providers increased at double the rate for commercial insurers as for Medicare fee for service.\n\nMedicaid's mandatory rebates -- 23.1% for brand drugs and 13% for generics off the average manufacturer price -- save Medicaid tens of billions of dollars a year. But drug makers have raised prices that privately insured and Medicare patients pay to offset those Medicaid rebates, especially for drugs used mostly by low-income patients. Medicaid rebates have also reduced the already slim margins for making generic drugs, contributing to the current shortages.\n\nSenate budget rules blocked Democrats from extending inflation rebates to private markets. So drug makers will invariably raise prices for privately insured patients and launch new drugs at higher prices. This may already be happening. Prescription drug prices have increased at a faster rate since the IRA passed, even as overall inflation has moderated.\n\nPrescription drug prices increased by 2% during the Trump Presidency owing to greater generic competition, yet they've increased 5.5% so far under Mr. Biden. In November they rose at an annual rate of nearly 6%. Has the White House considered that the reason Americans don't believe that the President's policies have helped them is because they haven't?\n\nONLINE: https://www.wsj.com/articles/bidens-drug-price-boomerang-630d284d?mod=editorials_article_pos7\n\nDec. 14\n\nThe Los Angeles Times says the U.S. should demand a Gaza cease-fire\n\nIsrael had broad support from the nations of the world after Hamas' murderous Oct. 7 attack, its premeditated slaughter of innocent people and its unconscionable taking of civilian hostages. Accounts of sexual assault and horrors even more unspeakable help to explain the ferocity of the Israeli counterattack.\n\nAs President Biden has noted, though, Israel is now losing sympathy and global support due to its \"indiscriminate bombing\" and Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu's rejection of any prospect of a future Palestinian state.\n\nHamas atrocities, no matter how evil, do not justify Israel's casual conflation of legitimate militant targets and Palestinian civilians.\n\nFrom the beginning of Israel's response, governments and observers urged an end to the disproportionate civilian killings and warned of starvation and rampant spread of disease in the tiny, densely populated strip of land. They called then, and are properly calling now, for a cease-fire.\n\nEarly on, Netanyahu said there would be no let-up.\n\n\"Just as the United States would not agree to a cease-fire after the bombing of Pearl Harbor or the terrorist attack of 9/11,\" he said on Oct. 30, \"Israel will not agree to the cessation of hostilities with Hamas after the horrific attack of Oct. 7.\"\n\nYet less than a month later, Israel agreed to a cease-fire -- of sorts.\n\nThe pause in military action that began Nov. 24 was set for four days, but talks mediated by Qatar resulted in two extensions. Hamas returned about 100 hostages and Israel released around 240 jailed Palestinians. Gaza civilians were given a respite for mourning their loved ones killed in the bombings and a chance to obtain water, food and medical supplies.\n\nHostilities resumed on Nov. 30. Since then, Israel's bombing of Gaza has been -- difficult as it is to fathom -- even more brutal. Having warned Palestinian civilians to leave their homes in north Gaza, and then essentially destroying Gaza City, the Israeli military is now bringing the same destruction to the southern part of the strip. Several aid groups described the humanitarian situation in the territory as in \"apocalyptic free fall.\"\n\nHorrified by the slaughter, most of the nations of the world have called for another, more-lasting cease-fire. The United Nations General Assembly adopted a resolution to that effect Tuesday, days after a Security Council vote was thwarted by a U.S. veto.\n\nIt's important to remember that from the time Hamas won Gaza elections in 2006, it and Israel have been at war, punctuated by periodic truce, pause or cease-fire (the terminology matters little to civilians trying to live their lives and raise their children).\n\nFull-scale fighting erupted in 2008, 2012, 2014 and 2021, then in each case largely abated. Each pause of a year, two years, seven years, brought not only periods relatively free from horror but also hope that cease-fires might be extended and just maybe lead to talks and a sustainable period free from cross-border attacks. Or even an accord paving the way to lasting peace.\n\nThe recent history of the Middle East consists of two urgent struggles. The obvious one pits Israel against Hamas, a terrorist organization, as each vows to annihilate the other and refers to its enemy in subhuman terms.\n\nThe second contest is even more existential. It's between the human aspiration to seek peace, despite real provocations and long-standing grievances, and the baser instinct to exterminate the enemy once and for all, notwithstanding the cost to innocent lives and gross violation of international laws of war.\n\nIn this struggle, the United States should choose a path that might make peace in the future still possible. It should reverse its position against a cease-fire.\n\nAcknowledging its own mistakes in response to 9/11 -- as President Biden noted at the start of the current war -- the U.S. should use its stature as a powerful democracy and its loyalty to and support of Israel to demand another respite from horror. And then it should work to make that pause a lasting cessation of hostilities.\n\nIsrael, as a fellow industrialized democracy with state-of-the-art intelligence, technology and defense capability, has set high standards for its response to attack. It has in the past deployed precision operations, such as the 1976 Entebbe raid to free airline passengers held hostage in Uganda by Palestinian and German hijackers.\n\nThe current indiscriminate killing in Gaza, in which two-thirds of the dead are women and children, bears little resemblance to surgical strikes and reveals little apparent distinction by Israel between legitimate Hamas targets and innocent civilians.\n\nNetanyahu's comparison with 9/11 may be more apt than he realizes. After the al Qaeda attack, the U.S. enjoyed the world's support against terrorism, then squandered it by its brutal tactics in the war. Today the Taliban again rule in Kabul. Al Qaeda is diminished, but Islamic extremism remains.\n\nEven if Israel succeeds in destroying Hamas, Palestinian statelessness, hopelessness and dehumanization will persist and are likely to give rise to new hostilities. Hope for change in this seemingly intractable conflict can begin when wholesale killing ends.\n\nONLINE: https://www.latimes.com/opinion/story/2023-12-14/gaza-ceasefire-israel-united-states-civilian-deaths\n\nDec. 14\n\nThe Guardian on the suffering of Palestinians\n\nThe scale and sheer horror of the war in Gaza has rightly captured the world's attention. But surging violence in the occupied West Bank should sound the alarm too. Last year was the bloodiest since 2005. This year is worse. Volker Türk, the UN human rights chief, has called the situation \"potentially explosive\", warning of the intensification of violence and severe discrimination against Palestinians. According to UN data, more than 450 have been killed by Israeli security forces or settlers this year, the majority following the Hamas massacre on 7 October. Twenty-eight Israelis in the West Bank have been killed by Palestinians in 2023.\n\nRaids on the Jenin refugee camp continued on Thursday, with a densely packed population living in fear and with access to healthcare severely affected, according to charities. Such operations have repeatedly led to the deaths of civilians - including children and the journalist Shireen Abu Akleh. Earlier this year, Human Rights Watch warned of \"systematic impunity\" for the killing of Palestinian children. The new wave of armed resistance has emerged in recent years amid the failure of Palestinian political leadership, anger over security force abuses and settler violence, despair at the unending occupation and the shrinking prospect of a two-state solution as illegal settlements expand.\n\nIn the last two months, thousands of Palestinians have been arrested - including, on Thursday, two key members of the West Bank's Freedom Theatre - with a record number held without charge or trial, and growing reports of humiliation and abuse of detainees. Meanwhile, settler violence has forced out multiple communities, and Palestinians face hunger as well as humiliation and danger. Hundreds of thousands have reportedly lost their jobs or had their wages frozen after Israel cancelled their work permits and severely restricted crossings. The Palestinian Authority is no longer receiving the import taxes on which it depends. Even the olive harvest is rotting on trees.\n\nThe announcement of UK and US sanctions on violent settlers is welcome. But the real issue is an extremist government that not only enables but encourages extremism. Benjamin Netanyahu handed significant powers over the West Bank to the finance minister, Bezalel Smotrich, who seeks to lay the ground for a doubling of settlers, and who claimed that there is \"no such thing\" as a Palestinian people. Itamar Ben-Gvir, the national security minister and a man with a conviction for racist incitement, has handed out firearms to settler \"security squads\". (The Biden administration is reportedly now delaying a deal for 20,000 rifles.)\n\nWhat is happening now in the West Bank is critical to the future of all Palestinians. What's left of the Palestinian Authority's credibility, already in tatters, would surely not survive economic collapse. The Israeli ambassador to the UK, Tzipi Hotovely, said \"absolutely no\" to a two-state solution this week. The sentiment is no surprise - her boss has committed to annexing parts of the West Bank and reportedly told legislators last summer that Palestinian hopes of a sovereign state \"must be eliminated\" - but her blunt contempt for the question was shocking.\n\nWhat does Mr Netanyahu's government then envisage for Palestinians? It rejects claims that it wants to force them out of Gaza. The alternative would appear to be permanent second-class status within a single state. The Israeli human rights organisation B'Tselem, Amnesty International, Human Rights Watch and a UN rapporteur have said that Palestinians are already subject to a form of apartheid. International talk of the two-state solution has long been vaguely aspirational at best and at worst a cover for inaction as it slipped further from view. It looks more hypothetical than ever now. Yet given the alternatives, it must become a spur to diplomatic action.\n\nONLINE: https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2023/dec/14/the-guardian-view-on-the-west-bank-the-suffering-of-palestinians-extends-beyond-gaza\n\nDec. 18\n\nChina Daily says the United States should leverage its influence over Israel\n\nThere are growing concerns that the military actions of Israel in the Gaza Strip may trigger a wider conflict in the Middle East.\n\nThree commercial ships in the Red Sea were attacked with missiles fired by Yemen's Houthi military organization on Sunday, while a US warship shot down three drones in self-defense during the hours-long assault.\n\nA spokesperson for the Houthi military explicitly said that their armed forces will continue to prevent all ships heading to Israeli ports from navigating in the Red Sea until food and medicine is brought into the Gaza Strip for the Palestinian people there.\n\nFour major shipping companies have already announced that they were suspending passage through a Red Sea strait vital for global trade because of the attacks on shipping.\n\nMeanwhile, two military bases housing US troops in Iraq have been repeatedly attacked by rockets and drones since early October after Israel launched its military operation against Hamas in Gaza.\n\nThere is thus the possibility that the US warships will launch an attack against Houthi military targets.\n\nThe concerns that the military conflict between Israel and Hamas in the Gaza Strip may spill over and develop into a regional war involving more countries and forces are therefore justified, thus dealing a heavy blow to world peace and global economic recovery.\n\nEven if such a military conflict does not take place right now, the Houthi military organization's continued missile and drone attacks against commercial ships in the Red Sea will have an increasingly serious impact on the development of the world economy.\n\nUS National Security Advisor Jake Sullivan said on Friday that the Houthis were a \"threat to the freedom of navigation of commercial shipping.\" The United States is working with the international community, with partners from the region and from all over the world to deal with this threat, Sullivan told journalists.\n\nSo far the US has responded with limited airstrikes against Houthi targets. But the question is will the US exert its influence on Israel to pressure it to sit at the negotiating table with Hamas?\n\nIf there is a military conflict between the US and the Houthi military forces, the situation in the Middle East will become even more complicated, and more countries may possibly get involved, and as a result, a larger scale conflict may erupt in the Middle East. This should be the last thing the world wants to see.\n\nYet if the US uses its influence to exert pressure on Israel for a cease-fire in the Gaza Strip and pushes for mediation between Israel and Palestine for a peaceful settlement of the long-lasting conflict between the two sides, the situation in the Middle East will realize a turn in the direction of lasting peace. That is what the majority of countries hope the US will do.\n\nONLINE: https://www.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202312/18/WS65802e01a31040ac301a84ee.html",

        "title": "Regulation Could Shape AI in 2024, With Big Tech Best Poised To Gain, Experts Say",
        "body": "Big tech companies could be best poised to gain from regulation, according to Goldman Sachs research, with a Wedbush Securities analyst indicating that Microsoft Corp. leads the pack.\n\nAfter President Joe Biden issued an artificial intelligence (AI)-focused executive order in 2023, experts suggest it's only the beginning of AI regulation in the U.S.\n\nWith more AI regulation anticipated in 2024, tech giants, like Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), could be best positioned to gain while regulators work to keep up with the emerging technology.\n\nAs advancing AI tech is further integrated into people's lives, regulation has become a growing priority intended to limit the risks associated with the tech.\n\n\"Privacy, safety, security, transparency, avoiding bias and discrimination, and accountability,\" are common themes considered in AI regulation, Duane Pozza, a lawyer at Wiley in Washington, D.C., who's focused on legislation involving emerging tech, told Investopedia.\n\nPresident Biden took the first steps toward widespread AI regulation in 2023.\n\nBefore issuing an executive order outlining general safeguards for AI use, Biden enlisted voluntary agreements from major companies leading the development of the tech including Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. (META), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), OpenAI Inc. and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA).\n\n\"One thing is clear: To realize the promise of AI and avoid the risks, we need to govern this technology,\" President Biden said, noting he considers the executive order \"the most significant action any government anywhere in the world has ever taken on AI safety, security, and trust.\"\n\n\"AI policy is like running a decathlon,\" White House special advisor for AI, Ben Buchanan, told Investopedia. Buchanan, who was involved in the creation of the executive order, said that \"from [the] thicket of AI and civil rights to the intersection of AI national security, AI and workers' rights, and consumers,\" the president is prepared to address \"all the different ways in which AI can affect our society.\"\n\nCompanies across the world are working on AI but regulation in the U.S. specifically could serve as an international standard.\n\n\"Right now, it's an American technology,\" Haim Israel, head of global thematic research at Bank of America, said, telling Investopedia that AI regulation is something his firm is monitoring in 2024.\n\nBiden's executive order is a step toward widespread regulation but is not the only way that the government is working to implement AI guidelines.\n\nThe \"Biden executive order is going to have a lot of impacts throughout what agencies are doing in the government, but has very limited ability to require private companies to do certain things,\" Wiley's Pozza said, highlighting that the executive branch of the federal government isn't alone in exploring regulation.\n\nSector-specific agencies, like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), work in industries that are already heavily regulated where there is \"no AI exemption from [existing] policies,\" Pozza noted, as opposed to some areas where the law is less clear.\n\nSome state governments are considering AI-focused laws, with California being \"the state to watch in 2024,\" Pozzo said, as state legislators consider proposals that would require companies to do mandatory risk assessments.\n\nA major difficulty that those creating AI policies face is keeping up with the rapidly evolving technology.\n\nBiden's 2023 executive order provides flexibility for adjustments, according to White House special advisor Buchanan, \"as time goes on because we know that technology might move in ways that we don't expect.\"\n\n\"Self-regulation by the tech industry around AI will be key,\" Dan Ives, a tech analyst at Wedbush Securities told Investopedia, saying that \"regulators are going 25 mph in the right lane while AI tech and Big Tech are in a Ferrari going 100 mph in the left lane.\"\n\nIves indicated that the firm isn't expecting robust AI regulation until 2024 or even 2025, as AI emerges as \"the biggest tech transformation since the start of the Internet.\"\n\nTech giants could be poised to benefit disproportionately from wide-reaching regulation, experts suggest.\n\n\"The impulse toward early regulation of AI technology may also favor large, well-capitalized companies,\" Goldman Sachs research found.\n\n\"Regulation typically comes with higher costs and higher barriers to entry,\" Eric Sheridan, senior equity research analyst at Goldman, said in a report, noting that the \"larger technology companies can absorb the costs of building these large language models, afford some of these computing costs, as well as comply with regulation.\"\n\nIn 2023, big tech company shares experienced a rally that outpaced the market at large, which may reflect \"investors recognizing the potential such players have to develop transformative AI applications,\" Goldman's research said.\n\nIves, the Wedbush analyst, echoed a similar sentiment, saying that the \"lack of consensus\" in Washington \"makes Big Tech the winner for now, led by Microsoft.\"",

        "title": "Cross River Bank aims to continue momentum in 2024",
        "body": "2023 was another jampacked year for Cross River Bank, and the Fort Lee-based technology infrastructure provider, which offers embedded financial solutions, is looking to carry that momentum forward as the calendar gets ready to flip to the new year.\n\nA prime example of that success can be found in its commercial real estate business. Despite operating in a tricky environment, given high interest rates and a tight credit market, in October, Cross River announced its team closed 78 loans nationwide over the previous 12 months. Totaling more than $840 million, the loans ranged from $450,000 to $81 million across multiple asset types.\n\n\"Achieving close to $1 billion in financing over the past 12 months for varying asset classes and markets speaks volumes to our drive and commitment to our clients in these challenging times,\" said Cross River Executive Vice President and Chief Lending Officer Shimon Eisikowicz in an October press release. \"While other lenders have closed the door on their clients, we've used this opportunity to work closely with our borrowers and produce tailored solutions for them without compromising on credit quality.\"\n\nNJBIZ recently caught up with Eisikowicz to talk about the year that was, what's ahead, industry challenges, areas of focus and much more.\n\nOpening that discussion, Eisikowicz acknowledged that 2023 has been a challenging environment. But, he said, that can be viewed multiple ways and as an avenue of potential opportunity - noting that Cross River was born in 2008 during the height of the financial crisis.\n\n\"There was no bigger challenge than the environment at that point - in the credit market, in the banking sector, in the real estate market, and so many others,\" Eisikowicz told NJBIZ. \"And I think that '23 has some resemblance to that environment. But we are built out of that challenge. And I think what we have built is just a small sample of what we are going to continue to build.\"\n\nHe stressed that regardless of any particular challenges or headwinds that may be present or coming down the line, the strategy for Cross River has remained the same since the beginning.\n\n\"It's really about the customer. It's really about the client,\" Eisikowicz explained. \"It's about the relationship. And, obviously, many banks use that cliché - if you would - we'll bend over backwards and we'll do this and that. We are really built on that. And, again, looking back - which is important, you've got to look behind you to know where you came from. I like to do that because it helps us stay focused. We set out to be different than other banks from our inception.\"\n\nEisikowicz referenced the early journey of the company from one branch in Teaneck during the height of the financial crisis with a lending limit of under $1 million in an expensive, challenging real estate market, to what it has grown into today.\n\n\"And how did we do it? We did it simply by focusing on the parts of the business that others aren't focusing on, can't focus on, or choose not to focus on,\" he explained. \"It may sound old-fashioned or mundane, but that's really the key ingredient to our success. It's focusing on the customer - what they need and how we can provide it. It's not always about rate. It's not always about dollars. Sometimes it's just about understanding the client's needs and figuring out a solution to their problem, to their needs.\"\n\nOn the topic of rates, which is a hot-button area of discussion and concern given current conditions, Eisikowicz again stressed that he tells clients, borrowers, attorneys and referrals that it is not just about the rate.\n\n\"I generally tell them, if your first question is about rate, we are probably not the bank for you. Not because we don't want to do business with them, but because if that's all you are looking for, there's so many banks where that's their focus,\" said Eisikowicz. \"We are not looking for market share. We are looking for real relationships.\n\n\"Real relationships often require handholding, customization, creativity, and a host of other things. So, the rate environment - sure it's a shock for everybody,\" Eisikowicz continued. \"In spite of the shock, we have been able to grow the business - not because we are smarter than anybody else, not because we are better than anybody else. But because we are willing to do more for that client - whatever more means.\"\n\nThat thinking and adherence to the company philosophy has guided Cross River in this aforementioned challenging environment, with the company viewing it as a time to not just be on defense but stay on offense -- especially as potential clients and borrowers look for solutions.\n\n\"We see it as an opportunity to earn the clients' trust and business,\" Eisikowicz explained.\n\nSpeaking in late November, Eisikowicz noted that Cross River was trying to finish the year out strong, closing as many deals as possible in the pipeline as well as unfinished business before the calendar turns.\n\nAs for 2024, he believes that current, tight conditions will linger at least through the early part of the new year.\n\n\"Unfortunately, this is the new normal,\" he said. \"And that new normal needs to settle in for many folks - whether it's the rate shock for some borrowers that expected to refi, maybe pull some of their equity out, pay some of their investors. Whether it's sellers that expected to get certain valuations that maybe they are not seeing because of where pricing and where the market has gone. There's a host of challenges that still exist. I think this is the new norm and that slowly people are going to adapt to it. And it takes time. Rates went up 500 basis points in a very condensed time. So, there's a big adjustment period for a lot of folks - lenders included.\"\n\nHe pointed out that a lot of loans are maturing and coming due in addition to troubled assets and the post-pandemic realities and challenges of office and retail space. Eisikowicz says this is why he set out to build a diversified business and not be too overly concentrated in one area.\n\n\"I try to make sure we stay diversified,\" Eisikowicz said. \"Thankfully, our portfolio is performing in spite of some of the challenges that certainly are existing in the market. The office market is absolutely more than just a headwind right now that I think is impacting many other verticals within the real estate space. And the lenders that are exposed to that - their exposure is also impacting the general real estate environment. These are all part of the unknowns as we go into '24.\"\n\nWhen asked about other potential headwinds or challenges, Eisikowicz pointed to processes that are bottlenecked in the capital markets side of the business as well as rent stabilization laws affecting multifamily assets. He says that all of that is contributing to the potential tsunami.\n\n\"All of these big challenges are coming together at the same time,\" he explained, describing it as a confluence of events. \"You've [also] got a host of maturities that are coming due - if they haven't already. And there's just so long that a bank can kick these down the road before they actually could deal with some of these issues. Early '24, I think we're going to start seeing some of these things get fleshed out because there's an expiration to the patience that a bank can have - whether it's from regulatory perspective or whether it's from shareholder perspective. So, I think that those are all going to come to a head as well -- probably early to mid '24.\"\n\nAs for Cross River's goals in 2024, Eisikowicz said the company is continuing to service its clients and help them move forward -- working through any challenges together along the way.\n\n\"Not every loan is going to perform the way people expect. Not everybody's going to have the same collections that they expected to have,\" Eisikowicz said. \"And many other issues that may come up that we are not even thinking of. The goal is to work with the clients, work with the borrowers - not just about making a loan, as I said, and putting it to bed. We're here. We are relationship builders. And I am sure we will have some challenges, but our goal is to address them the same exact way we did historically, which is being there for the client.\"\n\nOne recent example of meeting clients needs was the Cross River banking team raising rates for business and personal savings and CD accounts, which has resulted in immediate positive reception as well as branches serving more than three or four times the usual customers with new account openings.\n\nEisikowicz said that another major goal closing out 2023 was raising awareness of and educating clients and customers about these types of products and services on the banking side.\n\n\"Because, again, we are here to help them when they need loans. And I think that we'll be able to be there to help them with some of the deposit and banking products that traditionally we have not been as focused on,\" said Eisikowicz. \"But it's certainly at the forefront for us going forward.\"\n\nPartnerships, collaborations and philanthropy also continue to be major areas of focus for Cross River as the company continues to evolve and grow.\n\nIn November, Cross River marked National Scholarship Month by announcing that its philanthropic arm, Foundation@, donated a total of $740,000 in scholarships in 2023 -- ranging from youth education to university programs across both the United States and Israel. Here in the Garden State, that included contributions to Rowan University's emergency fund; Fairleigh Dickinson University; the Sinai School at Rosenbaum Yeshiva of North Jersey, which was renamed the Cross River Sinai School earlier this year; the New Jersey Institute of Technology toward the Cross River Opportunity Scholarship; and a Community Scholarship Fund, which aids local Teaneck students in need of financial assistance.\n\n\"Cross River is focused and dedicated to providing access to a fair, balanced, and quality education for all,\" said Gilles Gade, founder and CEO of Cross River, in a November press release. \"We will continue to support initiatives that equip the next generations in establishing the foundation for a better future.\"\n\n\"We are built on partnerships. We are built on giving. We are built on helping,\" said Eisikowicz. \"That's in our DNA. That's in our core - literally from the beginning.\"",

        "body": "Pope Francis has officially approved priests' blessing of same-sex marriages.\n\nThe controversial new approval of same-sex marriages has sparked recent debates among Catholics.\n\nMore conservative Catholics believe that Pope Francis is actively contradicting the word of the bible, while others are happy that same-sex couples can be saved through God.\n\nSame-sex couples can now be blessed by Catholic priests, following formal approval from Pope Francis.\n\nA new document explaining the change in Vatican policy was released Monday, saying that \"people seeking God's love and mercy shouldn't be subject to 'an exhaustive moral analysis' to receive it,\" the Associated Press reported.\n\nFrancis sent a letter to two conservative cardinals in October, suggesting that such blessings could be offered under some circumstances if those receiving the blessing did not confuse the ritual with the sacrament of marriage.\n\nThe church stands firm in its stance that marriage is a lifelong sacrament between a man and a woman, and that blessings should not be given at the same time as a civil union, using set rituals or even with other actions or clothing related to weddings.\n\nMore and more Catholics are losing faith in the Vatican.\n\nIt is no secret that Pope Francis is a historically liberal Pope, siding with many left-leaning ideologies.\n\nAdditionally, Pope Francis also spoke against Israel and said their attacks in defense against Hamas are \"terrorism.\"\n\n\"When people ask for a blessing, an exhaustive moral analysis should not be placed as a precondition for conferring it,\" the declaration, authored by Cardinal Fernandez and another official, states. \"The grace of God works in the lives of those who do not claim to be righteous but who acknowledge themselves humbly as sinners, like everyone else.\"\n\nThe new ruling says it is opening \"the possibility of blessings for couples in irregular situations and for couples of the same sex\" although says it is leaving decisions to \"the prudent and fatherly discernment of ordained ministers.\"\n\nJames Martin, a Jesuit priest who ministers to gay Catholics, described the latest move as a \"major step forward in the church's ministry to LGBTQ people,\" writing on X that it \"recognizes the deep desire in many Catholic same-sex couples for God's presence in their loving relationships.\"\n\nThe pope's attempts to shift the church's approach to LGBTQ Catholics began in 2013, when, in reply to a reporter's question about gay clergy, he said: \"Who am I to judge?\"\n\nOf course, CNN's reporting is mainly supportive of Pope Francis' approval of same-sex approval.\n\nLet me know what you guys think in the comments.\n\nIs Pope Francis over stepping his authority? Or is this something that needs to happen?",

        "body": "I've always believed that building a world where everyone shares a sense of belonging means making sure that each person has what they need to thrive. This year we continued our years-long work to put this belief into action, building bridges to greater connection, opportunity, access and knowledge - so that everyone is able to reach their full potential. Our work to make sure we can all do and become our best is far from over. And as we look back on 2023, I want to share three ways we've moved this work forward to support our employees at Google and people around the world this year:\n\nWe worked with a number of partners this year to connect more people to the educational experiences and developmental opportunities that can help them build their skills, businesses and creativity. In partnership with the American Indian Science and Engineering Society, we launched the Immersive Research Experience, a program designed to expand awareness and access to Computer Science research for Native and Indigenous students. And through Grow with Google support, we helped Technolochicas extend its impact from Mexico to the U.S. -- enabling 1,000 more young Latinas to develop the skills and experiences to pursue a career in STEM.\n\nOur work also fueled economic opportunity. Launched this year, the Google for Startups Women Founders Fund is helping woman entrepreneurs in Asia Pacific who are using AI grow their businesses in India, Japan and Korea, which are addressing critical issues ranging from mental health to housing insecurity.\n\nAcross our workplace, we built new tools and hit exciting milestones as we continue our efforts to create a Google where everyone feels supported in unlocking their best work. Building a workforce that is representative of our diverse world is an important piece.\n\nOur Diversity Annual Report this year showed we achieved our racial equity commitment goal of increasing leadership representation of Black, Latino and Native American Googlers by 30%, three years ahead of our 2025 aim. We also attained our highest-ever representation of women in tech, non-tech and leadership roles globally.\n\nAnd our onboarding program for Black Googlers, The Collective -- also part of our racial equity commitments -- reached more than 1,800 total participants across the U.S., Australia, Brazil, Canada, Ireland, Singapore, South Africa, and the U.K., with 97% finding the experience worth their time.\n\nWe showed up to support Googlers in the most difficult moments, too. As people in Israel, Gaza and around the world continue to be deeply affected by the terrorist attack and ensuing war, we took efforts to support our employees, as well as provide relief and critical resources as the crisis develops.\n\nWe continued to develop products and support research that showcases technology's immense potential for connecting more people to the information and experiences that help them do more -- and in ways that resonate with who they are.\n\nIn partnership with the National Congress of American Indians and our Google Aboriginal and Indigenous Network (GAIN) employee resource group, we made it easier to find Indigenous-owned businesses on Search and Maps through the new Indigenous-owned attribute. This is a continuation of our efforts to help businesses grow through technology and build products that reflects the diversity of our users, joining the available Asian-owned, Black-owned, disabled-owned, Latino-owned, LGBTQ+ owned, veteran-owned and women-owned business attributes.\n\nIn Maps, we'll now show our Accessible Places feature without needing to opt-in, identifying when a place has an entrance without steps -- information that can make a big difference for more confidently exploring the world around us, whether we're using a wheelchair or pushing a stroller.\n\nAnd through Project Elevate Black Voices, a first-of-its-kind partnership with Howard University launched this year, we're helping build more responsive speech technology and product experiences for Black communities.\n\nWe're excited to continue learning, creating and partnering in 2024 to deepen our work, helping people feel more connected and better supported in discovering their full potential and unlocking new possibilities that strengthen our shared world.",

        "title": "Boxing News: Christmas and International Boxing \" December 19, 2023",
        "body": "The Guadalupe-Reyes Marathon has already begun in our beloved Mexico. But what is this? December 12 is a major celebration of the appearance of the Virgin of Guadalupe. Millions come to Mexico City from all over the country to sing happy birthday to our Virgin, who appeared 500 years ago. With such also comes a great party, as it is a national holiday.\n\nReyes is the day in which the three wise kings come to deliver the toys to all children in Mexico, which is January 6. So, in between December 12 and January 6, it is known as a marathon of festivities, parties, and celebrations in which we usually gain from 10 to 15 pounds!\n\nThe cold weather we are having makes me feel the Christmas spirit even more, which we unfortunately usually forget, being from one side to the other, forever occupied, and busy. Everyday life does not allow us to pause, value, cherish, and appreciate what is happening and just how much we should be thankful for.\n\nI hope that we all achieve a much-needed moment of reflection in the company of our loved ones, and that the magic of God embraces our homes with joy, happiness, love, compassion, and gratitude during this holiday season.\n\nThis past Saturday an era of boxing concluded with the end of the Showtime Championship Boxing series. After 37 years of broadcasting, parent company Paramount decided to remove this sporting gem from its programming.\n\nShowtime is a pay channel, formerly known as cable, that also handles pay-per-view. It produced some of the most spectacular boxing shows in history.\n\nGreat boxers saw their careers pass through their screen and flourish. Marvin Hagler, Sugar Ray Leonard, Roberto Durán, and Tommy Hearns. The sellout of more than 136,000 fans at the Azteca Stadium, thrilling at Julio César Chávez vs. Greg Haugen, the two fights of Mike Tyson vs. Evander Holyfield, including the ear bite, the Israel Vázquez vs. Rafael Marquez trilogy, the glory years of Floyd Mayweather, and the monumental arrival of Saúl \"Canelo\" Álvarez, among more than hundreds of world championship fights.\n\nPromoters Don King, Dan Goosen, Tom Brown, Oscar de la Hoya, Gary Shaw, and many more had Showtime as the network to stage the best fights for four glorious decades.\n\nJust as Showtime announces its departure, Amazon Prime is coming to boxing in a big way! In addition, it was announced this week that PBC signed a multi-year contract with Amazon to carry all the boxing of this great group, which has more than 150 boxers in its lineup, including two more fights under contract with Saúl \"Canelo\" Álvarez.\n\nThis scenario happened years ago. When HBO left boxing, DAZN was born, a streaming company that has built a great position in the world of boxing. It is therefore logical to understand that we are entering the era of digital platforms, but we must not leave aside what TV is. This will always continue to exist, and the best combination will always be open television, cable, digital platforms, and pay-per-view for sport, whatever it may be.\n\nWith great pride, I watched the fight of the Mexican Yesica Nery Plata, who traveled to Germany and retained her light fly world championship by defeating the local Sarah Bormann by decision. It was a dominant and powerful performance. Fortunately two top-level judges were appointed by the WBC, since incredibly, the third, appointed by another organization, appointed a local judge who had the German fighter winning.\n\nThey also played tricks on her with the gloves by not letting her use the ones she intended (Reyes), and forced her to use the one of the sponsor of the event. But even with everything against her, she came out like a hurricane and fought a great fight. Now she is back home with her Green and Gold Belt. Bormann is a sensational fighter, also a pride of the WBC, and I am sure she will be coming back strong very soon.\n\nThe countdown begins for the day of final judgment. Day of Reckoning, a spectacular event that will take place in Saudi Arabia in celebration of the Riyadh Season: six heavyweight fights, with 12 fighters, nine that are ranked in the top 15 by WBC, including the top four, who are Deontay Wilder, Anthony Joshua, Arslanbek Makhmudov, and Frank Sánchez.\n\nIt has also been said that if they win their respective fights, Wilder and Joshua will face each other on March 8, in that same location, which is positioning itself as an epicenter of world boxing.\n\nThe last fight of the year for our organization will be on December 26, in Tokyo, when the Japanese fighter called Naoya \"Monster\" Inoue faces Filipino Marlon Tapales, a fight in which the four belts of the super bantamweight division will be at stake.\n\nThis year has been one of great professional and personal satisfaction. A very active, long, heavy, and tiring twelve months with multiple trips, but with brilliant results at the highest level. I wish to remember the first month of 2023.\n\nIn January we celebrated the ninth anniversary mass of my dear dad, José Sulaimán. It was in the old Basilica of Guadalupe in the company of hundreds of people, who, year after year, gather to remember him and hug us with such tender warmth.\n\nUnfortunately, I could not be physically present, as I had to appear before the sports arbitration court (CAS) in New York. The courage it bolstered me with when I got there was important, especially after being informed that the accusing party had decided not to travel and instead participate by zoom, not the fighter, his promoter, or lawyer flew as we did. This was a woeful lack of respect towards us, and above all, to the arbitors who flew from Europe to be in that meeting.\n\nAlso, in that month we had active participation with the IMSS, which is the National Bureau of Health, and its head, Zoé Robledo, and the sports director Héctor García, as we embarked on a nationwide campaign to promote physical activation through boxing fitness. Finally, I had the honor of meeting a legendary Dallas Cowboy, Charles Haley, a five-time Super Bowl winner, thanks to the efforts of my friend Robert González, as we are joining efforts to support Haley's educational programs in the USA.\n\nDID YOU KNOW...?\n\nIn Mexico, you can watch boxing on a large number of channels week after week: TV Azteca, Televisa, ESPN Knockout, Fox Sports, Imagen TV, Canal Space, and several digital and streaming platforms, such as DAZN, ProBox TV, and several more.\n\nTODAY'S ANECDOTE\n\nChristmas was always the happiest time for my dad. He worked hard with my mom to always give us a celebration full of happiness, harmony, and love, and also gifts, especially when we were young kids.\n\nOn one occasion when we were older, my dad arrived from a long trip on December 23, and he was out of time, so he couldn't do his Christmas shopping as he wanted and he was missing the gift for my brother Héctor: \"My son, go upstairs to my closet and bring down the black jacket that I have hanging in the back, I have hardly worn it and it is beautiful and he is going to love it.\" My dad placed it in its box and put it beneath the tree, advising: \"Don't tell anyone, it will be our secret.\" Héctor opens the gift from him and we all cheered: \"Let him put it on!\" The sleeves were at the level of his elbows! And my dad's laughter could be heard resonating all the way to the corner of the block.",

        "title": "Great Economic Holiday Gifts",
        "body": "The end of year data is giving economy watchers plenty cause for holiday cheer.\n\nConsumer spending remains robust, and the early holiday sales suggests a record year, even after controlling for inflation. That seems reasonable given that household wealth is at a record level and unemployment is lower than it has been since the Nixon administration. Last week's job reports showed record employment as part of three years of sustained employment gains.\n\nInflation-adjusted wages have been growing for several months now with the biggest gains accruing the lowest-paid 80% of workers. Credit card debt is back down to 2019 levels, and there is nothing apparent on the consumption side that would risk derailing this period of growth.\n\nStrong demand for goods and services means strong corporate profits, which has resulted in record-high stock market indices. The stock market is a poor predictor of future economic performance, but better returns further boost consumer spending, particularly among retirees.\n\nBusiness capital investment is strong but not spectacular, suggesting less volatile expectations by firms. Business expansion is broad and sustained since late 2020, but it is not at a feverish level. New business formation has been proceeding at record levels for close to three years now. Here in Indiana, applications for new businesses are up 84% since COVID, with the most recent quarter near the all-time record.\n\nFueling much of this optimistic behavior is the steadily retreating inflation. We are now 18 months past peak inflation, and the broadest measures of price change have dropped 16 out of the last 18 months. The measure of personal consumption inflation growth is actually negative over the past two quarters. This is caused by the Federal Reserve reducing the money supply, most visibly through increases to their policy interest rates.\n\nWe have now been through seven months without a rate increase, and the Fed again held rates steady this week. It now seems almost certain the Fed will begin easing rates within two quarters, and they have indicated that we should expect at least three cuts in 2024. Financial markets are anticipating this, so mortgage interest rates have declined for seven straight weeks. This will improve the home buying season this spring.\n\nAll of this is good news, but I am looking more closely at labor productivity. Typically, as labor markets tighten, productivity growth slows, or even declines. The reason for this is fairly self-evident. When unemployment rates are high, it is the least productive firms that make cuts. This boosts production per worker, since only the strong businesses survive. When unemployment rates are very low, it because of strong demand. This strong demand for goods and services means a number of less productive firms can still hang on. This slows productivity growth.\n\nFor the first 18 months after COVID, this pattern almost perfectly repeated itself. Big job losses meant that only the best firms survived, so productivity growth soared. As we got back to normal, we saw productivity growth dip into negative territory as expected. But, for close to two years productivity growth has slowly improved. Last quarter it stood at 2.4% annualized rate. This is good at any time, but when it happens when the unemployment rate is near a 50-year low, it signals something else is happening.\n\nNo one is sure about what might be happening to boost worker productivity, but the are several possibilities. First, is the cyclical nature of technology. We can go through long periods of buying and installing new technology without much effect on the productivity data. It took desktop computers almost two decades to really affect overall efficiency. We might just be in a cycle where investments in digital technology for the last decade is boosting our efficiency at making goods and delivering services.\n\nA second feature might be the expansion of remote work. For many occupations, the ability to work from home offers substantial productivity improvements. Randomized control trials from before COVID identified substantially more efficient workplaces when workers could voluntarily remain at home. There is significant evidence that businesses and workers are working out the kinks in technology and processes to make themselves more efficient.\n\nA third aspect of the economy is simple demographic change. Millennials are now the largest generation at work in the economy. These workers are entering the most productive years of their work lives, giving the U.S. a large bump in average worker productivity. This alone is large enough to boost overall economic performance.\n\nMost likely, all of these factors are working to make the current economy grow faster than we've seen so far in the 21st century. The blistering pace of GDP growth last quarter, topping 5.2%, suggests this is not a transient effect. Given a smooth patch of economic fundamentals, the U.S. might be heading for a period more reminiscent of the late 1990s than anything we've seen since. That would be most welcoming, but there are things that could derail a period of peaceful prosperity.\n\nWar and the rumor of war casts a durable shadow on the peaceful production and exchange of goods and services. As bad as war is, it is preferable to a peace that comes from victory by evil. Two major and several smaller wars pit liberal democracies against the purest of evil. Should Ukraine or Israel lose their wars, it would be disastrous for the U.S. economy. And that is if we are fortunate. Evil lurks in Tehran as well as other capitals. A major conflict will derail our economy, but failure in these wars would be worse.\n\nThe U.S. has a high debt, and though it has receded in recent quarters, remains uncomfortably high. The U.S. has weathered high debt for a lot longer than most economists thought possible a generation ago. However, higher borrowing costs threaten our ability to spend money where it is needed, and forces difficult spending and tax choices. A remedy to our deficit problem will require substantial political compromise on both spending and taxes. With the incentive structure in Congress fully condemning compromise, we should not expect action anytime soon.\n\nThis climate of opposition comes at the behest of voters. We elected these folks they reflect our values or lack thereof. We will pay for their folly, but don't blame them. We are at fault for electing people to 'fight' for us rather than 'compromise' for us. Smart, principled compromise is what we need to sustain our growing economy.",

        "title": "30 Least Peaceful Countries in the World in 2024",
        "body": "In this article, we will go over the 30 least peaceful countries in the world in 2024.\n\nPeace and economic prosperity are intertwined. Together, peace and prosperity form a virtuous cycle. The more peaceful a country is, the better its chances of enhancing its economic condition. On the other hand, a stable economy and a prospering nation ensure peace. The reverse of this situation is also true. Deteriorating peace and increasing violence hurts economic prosperity. On the other hand, declining economic conditions hurt peace. As per remarks by Dominique Strauss-Kahn, former Managing director of the International Monetary Fund (IMF), peace is a necessary condition for trade.\n\nThe United States ranks low on Vision of Humanity's Global Peace Index. The country has seen a huge decline in its ranking since 2009. According to the organization, the United States has seen a 150% degradation in the quality of information sub-category of the rankings. This subcategory measures the dissemination of false or misleading information domestically. However, despite the United States ranking low on the Peace Index, the country's actual peace level is much higher. United State's armed forces are involved in external conflicts, which hurt the peace index ranking.\n\nThe peace situation all over the world has been deteriorating. On the European side, the war between Russia and Ukraine continues to claim innocent lives. The Middle East is in the grip of conflicts that claim innocent lives every day. The conflict between Israel and Palestine is also affecting millions of people.\n\nGenerally, European countries are the most peaceful in the world. Iceland is one of the most peaceful countries in the world, and it has topped the Vision of Humanity's Peace Index since 2008. Other countries that often top the index are Denmark, Iceland, New Zealand, and Austria. On the other hand of the spectrum are countries such as Afghanistan, Yemen, and Syria, which consistently rank low on the index. African countries also do not fare so well in terms of peace. The democratic republic of Congo is one of the least peaceful countries in the world. The recent wars and conflicts have also hurt the ranking of many countries. This is especially true for Ukraine which has seen the largest drop in peace level in recent years. Then, there is the Middle East and North Africa region (MENA), which has seen the greatest deterioration in terms of peace.\n\nIn the wake of violent conflicts, defense spending globally has increased. According to SIPRI, in 2022, global military spending increased by 3.7%. All the countries in the world spent a combined $2.2 trillion on defense. The Russia-Ukraine conflict made many European countries conscious about their security too. The peaceful European countries expanded their military budgets following the war as European military expenditure increased by 13% in 2022.\n\nWhile deteriorating peace and increasing violence are bad news for the economy, it is good news for defense industries. The business of defense industries has been improving recently because of ongoing conflicts. It was one of the least impacted industries by the pandemic, as it maintained a stable growth rate. According to The Business Research Company, the global defense market expanded from $534.79 billion to $577.19 billion between the years 2022 and 2023, showing an annual compound growth rate of 7.9%. By the end of 2027, the market is expected to grow to $718.12 billion, depicting a compound annual growth rate of 5.6% from 2023 to 2027.\n\nWith that backdrop, let's look at some of the least peaceful countries in the world.\n\nWe compiled the list of the 30 least peaceful countries in the world in 2024, using the latest Peace Index Ranking by Vision of Humanity. It is the most widely accepted ranking throughout the world. The index uses 23 indicators of peace to score each country based on three domains. These domains are Ongoing domestic and internal conflict, Societal safety and security, and militarization. The higher the score, the less peaceful the country is.\n\nAlthough Palestine is the 30th least peaceful country on our list right now, going into 2024, it will be ranked much higher on this list. The Israel-Palestine conflict has claimed thousands of lives on both sides and continues to do so. According to Reuters, more than 17,0000 people have been killed in Gaza since October 7th, 2023. In addition, more than 2 million people have become homeless and are trapped in a tiny coastal enclave with a limited supply of food, water, and medical care.\n\nLebanon has been in the grip of a liquidity crisis, which has worsened the peace situation in the country. This crisis was further worsened by the sanctions imposed by the United States targetting Hezbollah and the Syrian government. In 2024, the peace situation in the country is likely to worsen because of the ongoing events in Israel and the Gaza Strip. The country already has violent clashes with Israel, which include almost daily rocket missile fires.\n\nMexico is one of the least peaceful countries in the world in 2024. The country has remained under the grip of organized crimes driven by extortion and retail drug crimes.\n\nAlthough Libya is on our list of the least peaceful countries, it is worth noting that it has recently made significant improvements. 2023 was the fourth consecutive year of its progress in the Global Peace Index.\n\nOngoing internal conflicts have sabotaged peace in Niger. The country is home to some of the most violent organized terrorist groups, such as Boko Haram, which has been persistent in its insurgency since 2009.\n\nThere is widespread violence between Cameroon's government and armed separatists in the country. The civilians in the country regularly face atrocities and violence because of the ongoing conflicts. The anglophone regions of the country are specifically targeted for violence.\n\nVenezuela has been a victim of political corruption, which has led to a social and humanitarian collapse in the country. Millions of people in the country have difficulties accessing food, education, healthcare, and shelter. There are also frequent reports of grave human rights violations.\n\nUnlawful and arbitary killing is a normal occurrence in Columbia. The country is in the grip of violent clashes between the government's security forces and armed groups, which lead to serious human rights abuse.\n\nSince achieving its independence in 1960, Chad has been in a state of constant instability and conflict. The country has remained under the grip of violent conflicts, which often lead to mass displacement of people.\n\nIsrael is in the middle of a violent conflict with Palestine and Hamas. On October 7, 2023, Hamas attacked Israel, killing 1,200 people and taking hundreds of hostages.\n\nViolent conflicts in Nigeria have left millions of people in urgent need of humanitarian assistance. The country is in the grasp of terrorism, and terrorists from the Islamic State West Africa (ISWA) and Boko Haram carry out attacks frequently.\n\nMyanmar is facing political tensions, and since the 2021 coup, its military has carried out a nationwide crackdown on millions of its people. War crimes and human rights abuse are commonplace in the country.\n\nMultiple internal and external conflicts have continuously disrupted peace in Pakistan. There is significant extremism and polarization in society based on religion and political views. In addition, state institutions have repeatedly failed to provide a peaceful environment.\n\nTurkiye is one of the least peaceful countries in the European region. Its president is blamed for ruling in an authoritarian way, targeting government critics and political opponents. There are also human rights violations against journalists, Armenians, and human rights workers.\n\nIran has a theocratic presidential system, which maintains an authoritarian hold on its people. Women do not have the same rights as men, and their appearance is heavily taxed. In September 2022, protests erupted all over the country over the detention of a girl for inappropriate dressing. However, the security forces in the country reacted with deadly force.\n\nNorth Korea is one of the least peaceful countries in the world, and the situation is likely to remain the same in 2024. The country is unpopular because of its provocative behavior and pursuit of nuclear weapons.\n\nBurkina Faso, like most other African countries, is in the grip of conflicts. Human rights violation is commonplace in the country, and deadly attacks by militant groups is a frequent occurrence.\n\nEthnic and regional conflicts have disrupted peace in Ethiopia. Its northern regions are in the grip of civil conflicts which often result in grave human rights violations.\n\nViolent conflicts are commonplace in the Central African Republic, which displaces thousands of people every year. In addition, Gender-based violence is frequent and part of everyday life in the country.\n\nSince 2021, abuses by armed Islamic groups in Mali have spiked. Security and human rights in the country have been severely compromised since then.\n\nIraq has been under several war and conflict waves over the past two decades. The downfall of Saddam Hussein's reign was followed by years of instability and political tensions in the country. The rise of extremist Islamic state groups during the second decade of this century also disrupted peace in the country. Iraq will likely remain one of the 10 least peaceful countries in 2024.\n\nMany militant groups in Sudan are up against the state-sanctioned military. The country is facing food shortages which results in violent clashes.\n\nUnlawful and arbitary killings are quite common in Somalia. Severe human rights violations are cals common in the country, and the government often resorts to degrading and inhuman punishments.\n\nThe Russia-Ukraine conflict has landed Ukraine on a list of the least peaceful countries in the world. The war will likely go on in 2024, and Ukraine will remain one of the least peaceful countries in the coming year.\n\nRussia is one of the least peaceful countries in the world. Its invasion of Ukraine has left more than 30,000 Ukrainian troops dead amid other civilian casualties.\n\nDemocratic Republic of Congo is one of the 5 least peaceful countries in the world in 2024. The country is in the grip of violent clashes, and there are severe human rights violations there.",

For our Welcome Home series, geared toward Bloomington-Normal's newest neighbors, we unpacked the Downtown and Uptown art scenes and McLean County's storied circus history.\n\nHere is a summary of some of our favorite arts stories from 2023.\n\nAmerican Passion Play's last curtain call: A 100-year-old Easter tradition in Bloomington came to an end in March with the final performances of Delmar Darrah's \"American Passion Play.\" Darrah, an influential figure in the Twin Cities, built the Scottish Rite Temple [now the Bloomington Center for the Performing Arts] expressly for his long-winded theatrical depiction of Jesus' ministry and the Passion of the Christ. \"This ministry has had its beginning and its end,\" said Bob Trefzger, who first participated in the \"American Passion Play\" in 1965 and played Judas in the final season. \"When people see the play this year, we hope they will take this additional message that they are to go -- as well as us -- and make disciples of all nations,\" he said.\n\nSurvivor Love Letters: Kylie Ashton Maurer moved her \"Survivor Love Letters\" gallery to the Coffeehouse in Uptown Normal this year, commemorating Sexual Assault Awareness Month with an interactive art instillation inviting survivors to contribute testimony and other creative ephemera. The result was a powerful love bomb of paper hearts, original artworks and impactful stories encouraging truth-telling, healing conversations and connections.\n\nAtlanta's giant boost to tourism: Atlanta's downtown centerpiece is a giant statue of Paul Bunyon with a hot dog. That's not a typo; although the statue does, indeed, resemble that mythical lumberjack. Once stationed at Bunyon's hot dogs in Cicero, the roadside attraction kicked off something of an obsession with enormous fiberglass statues in the town, realized as the now-open American Giants Museum. Just down the street, Atlanta cut the ribbon on another attraction this summer in anticipation of the Route 66 Centennial, memorializing a mine shaft that never struck coal -- but found plenty of water.\n\nGuys and planes: On any given Wednesday, some of the Prairie Aviation Museum's 30-or-so active members arrive at a nondescript tan building on Empire Street tucked between Central Illinois Regional Airport and an empty hanger once used by State Farm. They come for what they call their \"weekly meeting.\" Many are military veterans; most are men of a certain age looking for fellowship and fun during retirement. Their common bond is a love of aviation. We visited for a preview of Open Cockpit Days, a powerful experience for enthusiasts, veterans, kids -- anyone, really.\n\nThe Smithsonian in Chatsworth: A tiny town 50 miles northwest of Bloomington-Normal got some major props this fall when a Smithsonian Museum exhibit arrived thanks to the Museums on Main Street program partnered with Illinois Humanities. Chatsworth and neighboring town Fairbury were recognized for their innovation -- not the first thing you think of in post-industrial, rural America, right? Think again. Mary Catherine Carter of Central Illinois Community Connection talked to WGLT about how she uses the arts and a storefront in downtown Chatsworth to connect and invigorate small central Illinois towns.\n\nCircus Week: It was a big year for the Greatest Show on Earth, which launched a brand new, 50-city, cross-country tour this September. Bloomington-Normal got an exclusive sneak-peek in August at the Circus Historical Society's annual convention -- returning to the Twin Cities for the first time in over a decade. The keynote, by Feld Entertainment CEO Kenneth Feld, offered tidbits and insights about the new Ringling Bros. and Barnum & Bailey circus, a brand his father purchased from the Ringling family in 1967. The week capped with a rousing Sweet Corn circus, merging circus past and present in the heart of Uptown Normal.\n\nExploring the Ethnogothic: Around Halloween, scholars Stanford Carpenter and Eric Wesselmann stopped by the WGLT studios to chat horror. They taught an honors course at Illinois State University this fall about the Ethnogothic, a term coined by Carpenter and others positioning horror as a tool for understanding how people of different races and backgrounds process fearful situations. In a wide-ranging conversation on slasher flicks like \"Candyman,\" Blaxploitation and, inevitably, Pam Grier, this one ranks high among this reporter's favorites of the year.\n\n\"Maybe that's why we always wear our hats\": Days after the Hamas attack on Israel that sparked a bloody war overseas, dramaturg Morgan Rondinelli discussed her role dissecting the historical and cultural contexts of Ashkenazi Jews in Community Players' production of \"Fiddler on the Roof.\" She talked about the profound \"urge and tension\" experienced by Jewish Americans -- particularly in Christian-majority communities -- as they navigate multiple identities at once.\n\nWe had so much great stuff on the music front this year, we couldn't squeeze it all into one round-up! Check back later this week for our 2023 musical highlights.",

        "body": "What makes Christmas so special? It could be SNOW! Though a white Christmas in our area is rare, it certainly is special when there is one. It could be the Christmas tree decorated in multicolored lights, sparkling garland, and ornaments that bring back years of memories. It could be the Christmas cards with their beautiful winter scenes and thoughtful verses and the feeling of friendship when opening them. It could be the excitement that the Christmas parades bring with marching bands and festive floats.\n\nWhat else makes Christmas so special? It could be singing the treasured Christmas carols and sharing the birth of the Christ child by going caroling. It could be those tasty treats like fudge, fruitcake, eggnog, and sugar cookies cut out in Christmas designs and topped with sprinkles. It could be dining with friends and family, opening gifts, and taking priceless pictures of one another. It could be quiet time at the end of the day while sitting by a crackling fire and counting the many blessings of the year.\n\nTrue. All these things make Christmas special. But what makes Christmas most special is a place called Bethlehem, the manger, and the virgin birth -- the gift of God's Son who would one day die on a cross, rise again, and bring eternal life to those who believe -- the Savior, the King of Kings, the Prince of Peace. Without the birth of Jesus, there would be no Christmas. As the countdown to Christmas continues, may we remember to pray for our Tennessee neighbors who were devastated recently by deadly tornadoes and for peace in our country, in Israel, and around the world. God bless you and your family during this holy season. May you have a blessed, safe, and Merry Christmas!\n\nWords of Faith: \"For unto you is born this day in the city of David a Saviour, which is Christ the Lord.\" Luke 2:11 (KJV).",

        "body": "Area C-Suiters share their favorite memories, wish-list items, and New Year's resolutions.\n\nContinuing our series from the past few years, we bring you more reflections on holidays of the past, down-time tips, and goals for the coming year from C-Suiters across the region. Read on to find out which exec played a Stevie Wonder album \"3,000 times\" after getting a record player at age 10, whose lawn sports a 30-foot-tall reindeer, and which exec's three key words for 2024 are \"patience, adventure and minimize.\"\n\nBe watching in the coming days for additional posts, and read past editions from 2020, 2021, and 2022.\n\nHoliday traditions: \"Making recipes that have been in our family for decades, where there are no real measurements just terms like a \"dash\" of this, or a \"dash\" of that for instructions. Stuffing oysters is my favorite. We've also enjoyed serving the homeless and supporting the SoupMobile or other nonprofits over the years.\"\n\nFavorite gift: \"A handmade quilt from my mother made of fabrics from special moments over my childhood years. Her gifts were always something that took her a great deal of time and consideration. They were never of the highest cost but were always the most valued. She passed away years ago, and thinking of that gift is always a reminder as we get caught up in the hustle and bustle of shopping.\"\n\nOn this year's wish list: \"More time with my loved ones, and I believe that will happen because our gift each year to the kids is a family vacation.\"\n\nDown time tips: \"I'll share a quote from Dallas Mavericks CEO Cynt Marshall about juggling balls: There are two types of balls -- bouncy balls and crystal balls. Some are OK to drop, and others are not. It is just a matter of remembering to prioritize things accordingly. Give yourself some grace if a ball is dropped. Read Cynt's book, and you'll get it.\"\n\nMemorable moments from 2023: \"Meeting \"Pudge\" Rodriguez and the Rangers winning the World Series. My dad has been waiting for that moment his entire life. He had always hoped it would happen in his lifetime. He turned 80 just days afterward.\"\n\nNew Year's resolutions for 2024: \"Spend more time with my children and family. My oldest will be a senior in high school this year and will be going to college soon. I'm so proud of all of them and don't want to miss any special moments.\"\n\nHoliday traditions: \"The holidays are all about spending time with family. My favorite yearly tradition is enjoying a meal in the company of family members on Christmas Eve.\"\n\nFavorite gift: \"My first bike, at 3 years old!\"\n\nOn this year's wish list: \"I start every day with a high intensity CrossFit session. One can never have too many gym clothes!\"\n\nDown time tips: \"While enjoying spending time with family and friends, it's always important to be thankful for what we have and to give back where we can. At this time of year, it's important to donate to homeless shelters -- food, blankets, warm clothing, and more -- to ensure that those less fortunate are also able to enjoy the holiday season.\"\n\nMemorable moments from 2023: \"This was a great year for Envoy and for commercial aviation. Alongside announcing new aircraft deliveries, growing our ground handling business, expanding the scope of work at our hub locations, and so much more, nearly 20,000 employees across more than 100 airports provided outstanding service to hundreds of thousands of customers. It's a team success, and I'm looking forward to all that comes in 2024!\"\n\nNew Year's resolutions for 2024: \"What you do in your personal life lays the foundation for professional success. Some of the best leaders I've met are deeply focused on their lives outside of work. Those who are passionate about their interests, hobbies, friends, family, and communities can carry that energy into their professional lives and build on success. My resolution is to continue to work on my work/life balance. Both are critically important for success.\"\n\nHoliday traditions: \"Every year, my family visits the Dallas Arboretum's 12 Days of Christmas display. Sipping hot chocolate, we enjoy one of Dallas' gems -- marveling at the various gazebos and exploring the replica homes in the Christmas village. It feels quite special to journey through the gardens incapsulated by thousands of Christmas lights with my family.\"\n\nFavorite gift: \"One year, my children gave me a set of engraved leather-bound notebooks and pens. I enjoy writing, and I am reminded to slow down and jot down my thoughts when I see the notebooks.\"\n\nOn this year's wish list: \"Arthur Brooks' latest book, Build the Life You Want.\"\n\nDown time tips: \"For me, this is a work in progress. I have learned that it is important to create and maintain healthy boundaries with your professional life such that you spend quality time with your family. Over the years, I developed and communicated a clear work-back plan to set expectations around important deadlines or activities such that my team and I can recharge over the holidays.\"\n\nMemorable moment from 2023: \"Speaking before the Dallas City Council in support of Parkland's zoning application to build a health center located on the Dallas College Richland Campus. When the application was approved, I thought about the thousands of individuals who will now have access to compassionate and high-quality primary healthcare close to where they reside and work.\"\n\nNew Year's resolutions for 2024: \"To continue to practice bold leadership. Over the past several years, I have seen great progress in Dallas as a diverse group of organizations and individuals from the grassroots and grass tops work together to confront some of our city's most pressing challenges. We have created new green spaces, attracted new enterprises to historically underinvested neighborhoods, and strengthened our health ecosystem. At the same time, many residents in our community are locked out of the opportunity to advance our city forward. More than ever, we need a bold resurgence of what makes Dallas unique -- a cross-section of stakeholders leveraging the power of private and public resources to make substantial place-based, data-informed investments in the continuum (education, health, housing, workforce).\"\n\nHoliday traditions: \"We decorate big at our house, including a 30-foot-tall wooden reindeer in the front yard that we made ourselves. Whenever someone in the neighborhood asks where we live, we just say, 'The house with the reindeer,' and they know exactly which one. We're big-time crafters and DIYers, so there's always some new project in the works each year to add to the decor. A few years ago, I created a wreath from pinecones collected at my husband's childhood home in North Carolina that now hangs in our entryway.\n\nFavorite gift: \"Years ago, I received an Aura digital photo frame that I didn't expect to love as much as I have, particularly being able to see new photos pop up while I'm working. In fact, I love the frame so much that it's become one of my go-to gifts for relatives, including my mother and mother-in-law. We can easily add new photos of our kids to their frames as we take them.\"\n\nOn this year's wish list: \"I want a small point-and-shoot camera to use when we travel, instead of having my iPhone out all the time -- which inevitably leads me to messing around on my phone instead of soaking in the trip. The increasingly central role phones play in our lives has started to bother me, so I'm looking for easy ways to disconnect from it.\"\n\nDown time tips: \"I don't subscribe to the idea of \"work/life balance\" because, by definition, balance means they're opposing forces. I tell my team that we all have whole lives, which include interdependent professional and personal parts. The holidays traditionally slow down for us, so I encourage them to lean into the personal parts like holiday lunches with close friends, sleeping in if the night before was particularly \"festive,\" and doing their in-person shopping on weekdays so that they're not cursing themselves at NorthPark on a Saturday afternoon. I trust them to keep tabs on things as needed.\"\n\nMemorable moments from 2023: \"This summer we spent nearly two weeks in an old-school beach shack on the California coast just south of Santa Barbara. It didn't have A/C and was only about 1,000 square feet indoors, so we had the windows open the entire time and hung out as a family on the beach for most of the days. (The highest temp was in the mid-60s, so that was also a memorable respite from this year's brutal Texas summer!)\n\nNew Year's resolutions for 2024: \"I'm always being asked what products I like, how I cook something or what my twisted take is on something happening in our daily lives, so I'd like to explore my potential as a middle-aged influencer. Martha Stewart got her start at 50, so why can't I?! Speaking of 50, that's the birthday I'll be marking in 2024, so I intend to continue to focus more on my health.\n\nHoliday traditions: \"I follow the Christian faith, and my favorite tradition is the Christmas Eve Candlelight service. Something about the darkness, the candles in one hand in a congregation, as the year silently dwindles is peaceful, reflective, and meditative. My favorite treat is the yule log cake, a tradition my grandmother (Nallamah Amarasingham) started in Jaffna, Sri Lanka.\"\n\nFavorite gift: \"My wife, Naseem, once gave me a 'wall of affirmation.' It was the most heartfelt gift ever. My second favorite gift of all time was a Mechano set from U.K., which I got from my grandparents (Luther and Pushpam Jeyasingham) when I was 9.\"\n\nOn this year's wish list: \"It was a trip to Israel, which I had to cancel.\"\n\nDown time tips: \"Select one day a week where you do absolutely no work, including chores, and stick to it religiousl -- no matter what anyone says.\"\n\nMemorable moments from 2023: \"We had two mountaintop moments: First, dedicating our 2 millionth autonomously generated summary to my mentor, the great Dr. Ron J Anderson. Second, I did a 14-mile mountain hike in 24 hours with my best friend, my wife.\"\n\nNew Year's resolutions for 2024: \"I don't do New Year's resolutions per se. I have a set of five goals; at the end of the year I review them, celebrate what worked and revise what didn't. I then use the new year as the proverbial momentum builder on the same set of goals.\"\n\nHoliday traditions: \"One favorite tradition is making gingerbread cookies, decorating them with red hots and a lot of sparkling sugar, and taking to share with friends and family. We make a giant batch because we always eat a lot while we bake them.\n\nFavorite gift: \"I got a record player when I was 10. I then played a Stevie Wonder album 3,000 times. And there was a year when my parents couldn't travel and my brothers couldn't come home. I spent Christmas alone with my parents, and it was strangely quiet. I was feeling a bit blue until I opened a present from my oldest brother -- a fluorescent orange, inflatable tube man costume. I put it on, and my parents and I laughed and laughed. Knowing that he was thinking about us made the day brighter.\"\n\nOn this year's wish list: \"Some space and time to be still.\"\n\nDown time tips: \"Do something for yourself. That's hard to do, especially when there are children, parents, and friends demanding our time. But we must care for ourselves, so we have enough fuel in the tank to give to others.\"\n\nMemorable moments from 2023: \"The yin-yang of life; immense happiness at the groundbreaking at Oak Lawn Place, Resource Center's affordable housing development, and being with my father when he died.\"\n\nNew Year's resolutions for 2024: \"Keep my eye on the prize -- focus on what matters.\"\n\nHoliday traditions: \"The kids and I used to bake chocolate chip cookies together and leave those out for Santa. I still leave out cookies and milk for Santa, even though our kids are grown and out of the house. Since I am technically Santa, it gives me an excuse to eat cookies for breakfast on Christmas morning.\"\n\nFavorite gifts: \"The best gifts are the ornaments my kids made for me at school, and usually they have their pictures on them. I have had to glue some of them back together, but they all get a prominent display on the family Christmas tree. When I unwrap the ornaments every year, I look back at their pictures and it makes me smile.\"\n\nOn this year's wish list: \"I want a champagne color backpack for work, but I can't bring myself to buy it because it seems so frivolous. I am hoping Santa has heard me talk about it enough that he will get it for me!\"\n\nDown time tips: \"My best advice is to know when to say, 'No, thank you.' I have had to learn to control my FOMO and prioritize time with my boys when they come home for the holidays. I also take off the whole week after Christmas to decompress and only check work emails once a day.\"\n\nMemorable moment from 2023: \"My husband and I went to Argentina and dined with the U.S. Ambassador to Argentina and his wife at the Palacio Bosch, their official residence in Buenos Aires. I credit this once-in-a-lifetime experience to a dear friend who is like my big sister for letting us join her on this vacation.\"\n\nNew Year's resolutions for 2024: \"I don't make New Year's resolution because I feel that's setting myself up for failure. Instead, I choose words that guide me, and I try to honor them throughout the year. For 2024, my three words are patience, adventure and minimize.\"\n\nHoliday traditions: \"Growing up, my grandparents were my favorite people on the planet. Every Christmas we would go to Big Spring or Midland. Some of the best food and conversations that I've enjoyed most came from those traditions. Also, a family tradition of white elephant is a must.\"\n\nFavorite gift: \"In 1997 my dad bought me my first set of golf clubs. They were Lynx Black Cat irons with graphite shafts.\"\n\nOn this year's wish list: \"There is a small company called Artisan Golf in west Fort Worth that makes custom golf clubs. Their work requires multiple hours to build 'the perfect' golf club (putters, wedges, irons). I am an avid golfer and appreciate the small details so that would be an amazing experience.\"\n\nDown time tips: \"Be 100 percent present. Time goes by too fast to not create memories during moments of celebration.\"\n\nMemorable moments from 2023: \"Going to my son's first soccer game and watching him dominate! I'm an extremely competitive person who grew up playing every sport. Being able to watch him love competing was incredible. For the first time in Jack's life, I remember doing exactly what he was doing. For whatever reason, our bond became much stronger because of that day.\"\n\nNew Year's resolutions for 2024: \"Yoga. My state of mind creates success for myself and others. Yoga is not for everyone, but it gives me the ability to reset. This brings clarity and happiness for me personally and professionally.\"",

        "title": "MESA Open Letter to US and Canadian College and University Presidents",
        "body": "BY THE MIDDLE EAST STUDIES ASSOCIATION OF NORTH AMERICA\n\nThe following statement by the president of the Middle East Studies Association and the chair of that association's Committee on Academic Freedom was published online on December 18.\n\nOpen Letter to US and Canadian College and University Presidents\n\nWe write on behalf of the Middle East Studies Association of North America (MESA) and its Committee on Academic Freedom to urge you to uphold academic freedom on your campuses. The Palestine-Israel conflict has long been a source of passionate debate and clashing scholarship and views, but never have we witnessed the extent of threats to faculty, students and staff that we have since 7 October. During this fraught time, we call upon you to redouble efforts to protect the free speech rights and defend the academic freedom of all members of your campus community.\n\nMESA was founded in 1966 to promote scholarship and teaching on the Middle East and North Africa. The preeminent organization in the field, the Association publishes the prestigious International Journal of Middle East Studies and has nearly 2,800 members worldwide. MESA is committed to ensuring academic freedom and freedom of expression, both within the region and in connection with the study of the region in North America and outside of North America.\n\nFree speech is essential for any democratic polity, and this country's institutions of higher education should be places in which even the most controversial and unpopular views can be expressed, debated and criticized. At the same time, all students deserve equal access to education, free from harassment and discrimination. Unfortunately, we are witnessing a dramatic increase in antisemitic, anti-Palestinian, anti-Arab and anti-Muslim harassment and discrimination on our campuses. North American institutions of higher education must confront this surge and vigorously combat all forms of racism and hate speech as well as threats, violence, harassment and intimidation directed against members of our campus communities.\n\nWe also share the concern expressed by defenders of civil liberties nationally that \"ideologically motivated efforts to police speech on campus destroy the foundations on which academic communities are built.\" We note that the environment on North American campuses resembles that of the period following the attacks of 11 September 2001, when students and faculty who criticized U.S. government actions or sought to provide historical context for the attacks were subject to harassment and assault. The current attempts to police acceptable speech, suppress certain phrases and perspectives, and punish (or even criminalize) political expression are also reminiscent of the McCarthy/\"Red Scare\" period of this country's history. College and university campuses must remain vibrant spaces in which the free exchange of ideas is promoted and protected, including criticisms of Israeli policies or actions and advocacy on behalf of Palestinian rights to freedom and equality. We call on you to reject baseless demands to investigate, discipline or punish members of your campus community for exercising their constitutional right to freely express their views.\n\nAs university leaders, you have a heightened responsibility during fraught times to protect the freedom of expression, academic freedom and physical safety of all members of your campus. Undergraduate and graduate students, and untenured instructors and faculty, are especially vulnerable at a time when actors within and outside of the university increasingly resort to intimidation, harassment, threats and defamation to silence and punish those with whom they disagree. When university leaders fail to speak out in defense of faculty members, students and staff, they thereby abdicate their professional and academic responsibility and, intentionally or not, send the message that they countenance silencing, defamation and harassment. Such an abdication also emboldens individuals and organizations with a political agenda to weaponize their claims in order to disparage and silence those whose views they dislike. We note in particular the dangerous conflation of criticism of Israeli actions and policies, and of Zionism as a political ideology, with antisemitism. In our letter dated 7 December 2023 to members of Congress, we underscored how this conflation has been deployed to silence legitimate political speech and intimidate those who seek to learn about the current conflict through candid discussion and debate on our campuses. The worry that senior administrators may pay a steep price for defending campus speech codes and the rights of all campus communities has had its own chilling effect across the country. As university leaders, we urge you to resist such external pressure and counteract this atmosphere of recrimination and suspicion by reinforcing a culture of free speech and critical inquiry on your campuses.\n\nIn a statement dated 16 October 2023, MESA's Board of Directors declared that it is \"acutely concerned with and heartbroken by the loss of Israeli and Palestinian lives....There can be no justification for the targeting of civilians. Many of our members have been directly affected and we join them in grieving. We also join all those who are committed to a political solution that offers safety, dignity, and equal rights for Palestinians and Israelis.\" The same statement went on: \"We call on university leaders and administrations to affirmatively assert and protect the right to academic freedom and freedom of speech on their campuses. We reaffirm that there can be no compromise of the right and ability of students, faculty, and staff at universities across North America (and elsewhere) to express their viewpoints free of harassment, intimidation, and threats to their livelihoods and safety.\" Some two months later, our grief at the ongoing violence has grown as has our conviction that protection of rights of speech and association on campuses across the country is all the more essential.\n\nWe draw your attention once more to our Association's call to protect all of your universities' and colleges' students, faculty and staff in the exercise of their right to freedom of speech and of association, without fear of threat, harassment or intimidation. We also urge you to reiterate forcefully and clearly your commitment to resolutely defend the principles of academic freedom, which are essential to the intellectual and educational missions of institutions of higher education and to preserving a democratic society.",

        "title": "Amazing letter about fans in 1871",
        "body": "In 1871, the Cubs, then known as the White Stockings, were among the 9 members of the National Association, baseball's first true professional league.\n\nThe \"Whites\" won their first 7 games, against 5 opponents, before losing to the Mutuals, 8-5, at New York on June 5.\n\n...\n\n\"They were promised another game,\" the Chicago Tribune wrote some weeks later, \"and, a few days later, went on the field to play, but the sudden appearance of a slight rain shower gave the Mutuals a pretext for withdrawing just after play was begun, although the weather cleared up within five minutes after the Mutes had left the field.\n\n\"They were evidently only too well pleased to get out of it so, for they seemed to share in the presentiment of the Chicago boys, who went on the field with the utmost confidence, feeling that they would win beyond question.\n\n\"An effort was made to finish the postponed game on the following day, but the Mutual management would have none of it, and so the Whites were compelled to return home without the much-coveted opportunity to redeem themselves.\n\n\"Since that time the nine has looked forward, with eager interest, to the day when the Mutuals would make their appearance in Chicago, for the beating of this club was deeply-cherished hope and intention with them. They believed they could do it, and they only awaited the chance to make good their pretensions to superiority.\"\n\nThe Mutuals finally stepped onto the Union Base-ball Grounds in Chicago on Friday, July 28.\n\n\"The great game to-day promises to attract the largest attendance ever seen at a base ball match in Chicago, if not in America,\" the Tribune said that morning. \"Besides the immense throng which this city will turn out, large crowds have arrived and are expected from the surrounding country. The grounds will be pressed to their utmost capacity to accommodate the spectators . . . \"\n\nIn its coverage of the game on Saturday, the Tribune estimated that 12,000 flocked to the park. Game-by-game results of the Whites' season at baseball-reference.com put the count at 10,000. Either way, it was so many that, \"although such a step had not been contemplated, it became necessary to allow perhaps five hundred people to stand and sit along the fence in left field.\"\n\nThe Mutuals scored 2 runs in the first inning. The Whites matched that in the second and took a 3-2 lead in the fourth. Then they erupted for 8 runs in the fifth, the final 2 coming on a home run by Fred Treacey, and rolled to a 17-6 victory.\n\nTheir final 3 runs came in the bottom of the ninth. Under the rules in 1871, all innings had to be completed, even if the team batting second led after its opponent had batted 9 times. Player-manager Jimmy Wood hit a 2-run homer in the ninth. Treacey tripled and came home on a groundout.\n\nThe Whites outhit the Mutuals, 20-11, and made 53 bases to the Mutes' 14. They made only 3 errors, to New York's 10.\n\nAll in all, it was a remarkable performance.\n\n\"A Glorious Day for Base Ball in Chicago\" said the first of the 5 one-column headlines above the Tribune's account of the contest, which filled more than 2 full columns.\n\nThe following day, Sunday, July 30, the Tribune published on its editorial page something glorious in its own way: a long, humorous letter, ostensibly from \"Peregrine Pickle,\" about the game and baseball's effect on its fans.\n\nFollowing is the entire letter. Multiple paragraph breaks have been added, for easier reading; as printed, its 2,446 words were divided into just 11 paragraphs, excluding the salutation, a brief exchange of dialogue and the final 2 lines. Section breaks also have been added.\n\nThe 5-10 minutes required to read it will be well worth the time.\n\nA week ago the world was agitated with the facts that Lake Michigan was running into the Gulf of Mexico, that the Ribbonmen were having an unpleasantness with the Orangemen [in Ireland], that [Civil War hero] General Pleasonton was to resign, that Thiers had marked out a policy for France, that Spain had formed a new ministry, that the real San Juan boundary had been discovered, that the Emperor William [of Germany] was going to meet the [Russian] Czar, and that the Pope wanted to go somewhere and didn't know where to go, and other such ephemeral matters which have no interest for the Gradgrinds, and are deemed of some importance at the time.\n\nHow much importance they possessed, however, may be judged from the fact that in one day's time the Ribbon row was over, that nobody cared whether Lake Michigan flowed into the Gulf of Mexico or the Gulf of Patagonia, that General Pleasonton did not resign, that Thiers was only rumored to have made a policy, that Spain hadn't got any ministry after all, that the old San Juan boundary was a myth, that William hadn't made any arrangements to meet the Czar, and that the Pope was contented to stay where he was.\n\n...\n\nThere is but one thing in this world that is sure, that has any value or importance beyond the present, and that is Base Ball. It is a vital issue. It is the great moral, social, and religious test of the nineteenth century.\n\nThose who witnessed the game on Friday between the White Stockings and Mutuals will carry the memories of it to their latest days, and will rehearse the story to their grandchildren, innings by innings, how Treacey pasted a corker and Mills muffed a fly, how Zettlein rattled Ferguson, and Wood sent a liner over the short stop.\n\n...\n\nThose unhappy beings who did not see it will carry their gray hairs down to their graves in sorrow, and upon the tombstones will be inscribed epitaphs to the effect that, although they were good and virtuous while living (as all dead people were), and although they did much for their day and generation, and were sincerely mourned when they made their exit, they did not see the White Stocking-Mutual game, and, consequently, their lives were not complete.\n\n...\n\nYou should have seen these two this morning. Araminta drove over immediately after breakfast to see Celeste. She was radiant with smiles, and as fresh and beaming as a morning-glory, and had the score[book] with her.\n\nAraminta is the same girl who made such a sensation in Grace, last Sunday, by accidentally taking her score with her instead of her prayer book, and reading off the muffs and foul flys for responses.\n\nIt very seriously disturbed old Mrs. Brown in the slip front of her, for every time Mrs. B. came out with her last Amen -- and she usually comes out very strong on that dissyllable -- Araminta came out with \"A run\" in an excited tone of voice, at which Mrs. B. would turn round and look at her deprecatingly from under last year's bonnet, recently made over.\n\n...\n\nI was enjoying my after-breakfast cigar, and the chatter of the two Dear Creatures came to me in rather a broken manner. As near as I could make out, the conversation was somewhat after the following fashion:\n\nAraminta: \"Why! to the game, to be sure. Everybody was there.\"\n\nCeleste: \"Oh! dear! Oh! dear! That stupid pa. I asked him at breakfast, yesterday morning, if there was to be a game. He said he hadn't heard of any game.\"\n\nAraminta (in a material kind of way): \"My dear Celeste, when will you learn to find out these things yourself? What does your pa care for base ball. You should look at the sporting column of THE TRIBUNE, and then you will know how it is yourself.\"\n\n...\n\nPerhaps you have noticed that when one dear creature gets the advantage of another, she likes to explain the grounds of that advantage with a frightful degree of detail, leading to an exaggeration of the most tantalizing description.\n\nFor fully ten minutes she rattled on in a wilderness of base ball ball technique, specially dwelling upon the manner in which Zettlein made a home run by corking a paster over the home plate to the short stop of the right centre field, and then running on a foul fly which was muffed by Ferguson in consequence of Mills being rattled on to third base by wild throw from the foul flag to the left field.\n\nAnd then she took our her score and pointed to the exact spot where Zettlein achieved this remarkable feat, which will for ever secure him a place in Araminta's affection.\n\nCeleste gazed at the spot with a wistful expression and with that same irrepressible longing with which pious tourists regard the bones of the 10,000 virgins in the stinking town of Cologne.\n\n...\n\nAraminta's description of the home run, to be sure, was not altogether accurate or even plausible, but it was graphic and lively enough to plant a thorn in the heart of Celeste and to agitate her gentle breast with the feeling that she had missed something of this life's experiences, for which time could hardly make compensation.\n\nThis feeling was still more intensified when Araminta displayed a most charming pair of riding gloves, and informed her that she won them in a bet with young Boosey, who was silly enough to wager that the Mutuals would beat the Chicagos two to one.\n\nAnd thus the two went on, the one full of self-conscious pride at having fulfilled her duty, the other, meek and lowly, and crestfallen, with the mortifying knowledge that all the world was there and she was at home.\n\n...\n\nCeleste has taken time by the forelock and secured a front seat for the next game on Tuesday, and to make amends for her remissness she has bet her favorite saddle horse against a box of cigars with young Hyacinthe that the White Stockings win, and she avows that she will wear pure white in honor of the occasion. If the Whites don't win the game and save her saddle horse, under the influence of her bright eyes, and if Zettlein don't [sic] repeat that remarkable home run, they are ungallant to say the least.\n\n...\n\nAnd by the way, are not our ladies going to be as patriotic as the English ladies, who, at the boat races and on the turf, wear the colors of their favorites? Just think how the New Yorkers would play if they should espy some fair creature \"a wearing of the green,\" and how the White Stockings would bat, with the color fluttering all round the field.\n\nWith such inducements before them, King would be willing to split both hands, Zettlein to lose one eye out of his handsome face, Duffy to break an arm, Pinkham to sacrifice a rib, Wood to break all his fingers, Treacey to go on one leg, Hodes to break his back, and so on through the nine, and it would be a far exceeding eternal weight of glory for the whole nine to be carried off the field on litters.\n\n...\n\nNapoleon once mounted to the top of one of the Pyramids, and exclaimed to his army: \"The eyes of forty centuries are looking down upon you,\" or words to that effect. And it had an immense effect upon the Gauls.\n\nHow much greater effect would it have upon the White Stockings if the petite and spirituel [team president Norman] Gassette should mount to the top of the grand stand and exclaim to his boys: \"Chicago expects every man to do his duty; the eyes of a thousand of her daughters look down upon you.\"\n\nFirst at the bedside of suffering, first in all gentle deeds of charity, first to alleviate the terrors of the battle field, woman is also first upon the base ball ground, and she occupies two seats instead of one.\n\n...\n\nIsn't is curious, the effect the game has? I saw two instances of it on Friday.\n\nA grave, matronly-looking woman, who at home is looked upon as a mother in Israel, and whose time is mainly spent in preparing good little boys to die young, sat near me.\n\nDuring the first innings she was dignified. In the second she was sedate, but uneasy. In the third, she manifested some interest in the game.\n\nIn the fourth she asked her companion the nature of the game. In the fifth she smiled. In the sixth she clapped her hands in a subdued manner, and looked around rather uneasily to see if anyone had noticed her.\n\nIn the seventh she clapped her hands without regard to those about her. In the eighth she grew excited and waved her handkerchief.\n\nIn the ninth, when Jimmy Wood made his home run, she could stand it no longer. She jumped up, she laughed, she shouted, she waved her parasol, and, stopping down to her partner, a grave, gray-haired gentleman who was regarding the game with much the same expression of countenance that the Japanese stage manager exhibits when he explains the feats of his party to the audience, she hit him a slap in the middle of the back which resounded all over the stand, and exclaimed, \"Why don't you get up, old man, and shout?\"\n\nThe old man winced for a moment, and then, rising as soberly as a ghost from a grave, gave one little shout, but it was a very feeble one, and sat down again, in the vain effort to comprehend what the people around him were making such a fuss for.\n\n...\n\nThe other case was that of a good Methodist brother who was evidently deeply interested in the game and was evidently recalling the days of his boyhood. Behind him sat two young gentlemen, each of whom was anxious to get a bet out of the other as the game proceeded.\n\nAt each proposition, the old gentleman would turn round and watch the younger ones with a peculiar look. I confidently expected to see him arise and deliver a lecture to them upon the sinfulness of betting.\n\nAt last, in sheer desperation, one of the party offered to bet other fifty to twenty-five that the Mutuals would win. The party of the second part wouldn't bet.\n\nThe temptation was too strong, however, for the old man. He struggled for a moment, but the odds of two to one captured him. He quietly turned around, and in a bland, childlike manner, remarked, \"I will take that bet, my young friend.\"\n\nHe took it, and he won it, and got the money, and he will surprise his brethren to-day by making a donation of fifty dollars for the relief of the Tongaree Islanders, who recently ate up their only missionary when in a frolicsome mood, and now want another.\n\n...\n\nThe good brother did a good day's work, for he saw a good game of ball, relieved the ungodly young man's pocket of fifty dollars for missionary purposes, and has added largely to his own stock of devotional fervor, for, in the congregational singing, it is noticed that his voice is very prominent when the choir strikes up his favorite old hymn, \"Who are these in white array?\"\n\nHe knows well who they are. He knows they are not \"Our Mutual Friends,\" but the other fellows; and his knowledge has contributed fifty dollars toward another missionary fricassee for the Tongarees.\n\n...\n\nThere is a meteorological fact of some interest connected with this Base Ball business. At every game played this season the wind has blown from the east. Now an east wind in itself is not objectionable, but it is a noticeable fact that when a game is played and the wind is east, there are an unusual number of locomotives engaged in doing nothing alongside the east fence.\n\nPrecisely at half-past 3 these switch engines come racing along from all quarters, to get good positions. The engineers and firemen then make everything comfortable in their cabs by feeding the furnaces sufficiently to last a couple of hours, and mount to the top to see the game. The result is that the combined smoke-stacks keep the ball ground covered with black smoke all the afternoon.\n\n...\n\nNow as we have got to have more games this season, and it is pretty heavy works to get one of these locomotives out of the way, it is plainly Gassette's difficulty to arrange with Dr. Rauch, who has charge of the meteorology, tidal eaves and wind currents off Lake Michigan, for moving the wind to another quarter on ball days. [Rauch was head of the city's National Weather Service office.]\n\nSo much coal smoke is detrimental to the health of the spectators, and on this ground alone the doctor can shove the wind round into the west without violating his conscience, or at all transcending his prerogatives.\n\n...\n\nIs base ball popular? Two thousand people in the grand stand, 8,000 people on the tiers, 2,000 people standing up, 1,000 on the Michigan Avenue roofs, John V. Farwell's clerks at the windows, Butters looking out of an upper window, 1,000 ladies in Pullman's building, 100 people on the roofs corner of Wabash Avenue and Washington, and a solitary individual with a telescope sitting on a chimney at the corner of State and Washington, answer \"yes.\"\n\nNo wonder that Celeste wants to go on Tuesday. No wonder that she has staked her favorite saddle horse on the result!\n\n...\n\nAnd now, just one word to you, old Mulligrubs, who turns up your nose at every innocent amusement; who go through our streets every day with sour faces; who keeps your grindstones going all the time with other people's nose on them; who see no amusement in anything that does not put money in your pockets; who are slowly but surely fossilising yourselves, and preparing your selves to be nuisances to every one about you when you grow old; see if you can't arrange to have some business on Tuesday afternoon near the ball grounds, so that you can drop in a moment and see what base ball is doing for blood and brawn.\n\nSee how it develops soft flaccid legs and arms into iron, and see how people enjoy themselves. Fling down your pens, and your books, and your ledgers, and surprise yourselves with two hours of healthy and hearty enjoyment in the open air.\n\nAm I going? Well, I shall happen round in that vicinity. -- PEREGRINE PICKLE.",

        "body": "In a strategic decision following thorough deliberation and consultations with its partners, Birthright Israel, globally renowned as the premier educational tourism organization, is poised to recommence its complimentary 10-day expeditions to Israel during the week commencing January 5, 2024.

        "title": "Marriott Stock Remains An Unbeatable Giant In The Rebounding Market (NASDAQ:MAR)",
        "body": "The stock price remains undervalued with attractive upside potential.\n\nThe hotel industry plunged into its rock-bottom at the height of the pandemic. But three years later, the picture has completely changed. It has already regained its footing and is poised to reach pre-pandemic levels. It does not show a possibility of a slowdown amid macroeconomic volatility. Thanks to the resilient travel spending and changing work landscape that allow more people to make domestic and international trips.\n\nMarriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) enjoys a favorable tourism trend. It shows stable top-line growth and decent liquidity as it expands and builds more properties. Also, it has a solid market positioning with its huge operating capacity and efficiency. Even better, the stock has paid off over the years having the best returns since the Great Recession. It outperformed its close peers like Hilton (HLT) and Hyatt (H). The current price also makes the stock an excellent buy.\n\nMarriott has already escaped the pandemic quicksand and remained a hotel giant. And today, it continues to dominate the market with its impressive top-line growth and sustained expansion. Thanks to revenge travel and the company's prudent asset management.\n\nThe total operating revenue for the third quarter reached $5.93B, a 12% YoY increase. QoQ growth inched down by 2.4%, which we can attribute to the inflation uptick from July to September. This can be observed mainly in its US and Canadian markets. Yet, the opposite can be seen in its international market, particularly in Asia Pacific. In fact, its RevPAR in the region rose by 22%, driven by the sustained increase in the number of properties and occupancy and room rates. In only a year, the total number of its rooms worldwide increased by more than 70,000, bringing the total to 1,581,002. The increase was much higher than of its close peers namely Hilton and Hyatt. We will make a comprehensive comparison of these lodging companies in the next section. With its huge market presence and solid brand recognition, it has expanded its customer base domestically and internationally.\n\nGiven this, discretionary spending, particularly on tourism, has been resilient. This was mainly driven by external factors other than the pent-up travel demand. Prudent economic policies, stable labor market conditions, and digital transformation were some factors.\n\nFirst, macroeconomic improvements in the labor market have been visible. These have helped a lot of people withstand inflationary pressures. For instance, the unemployment rate in the US had an uptick in recent months. Yet, we can see it was primarily driven by the higher number of people entering and reentering the labor force. Most importantly, the average hourly wage in the US has risen continuously since its recovery from the pandemic. This helped many people with purchasing power, especially non-essential items and services. This fueled their desire to travel after being locked in homes for about a year.\n\nSecond, the labor market transformation has been very favorable for the tourism sector. The prevalence of remote work flexibility in businesses helped employees increase their travel frequency. Since 2022, its impact on the travel landscape has been evident. It increased hotel occupancy rates and improved flexibility with hotel booking rates. It was especially helpful for Marriott since its business model is mainly fee-based. It's easier for MAR to adjust rates to demand and macroeconomic changes in contrast than a lease-based model. In a study, over half of American travelers spend more on travel than they did in the previous year. Regarding frequency, over 80% are traveling more often today than they did in 2022. Pandemic-driven revenge travel remains an essential factor since 29% of the respondents agree that their travel plans today are related to delays in the past three years. Another study reveals that 40.7% of full-time employees are working either remotely or hybrid. Unsurprisingly, the estimated number of Americans working remotely may reach 32.6 million by 2025. Hence, more and more people may maintain or increase their travel spending and frequency.\n\nThird, cost pressures have started to ease as inflation decelerated to 3-4% from 9.1%. This reflects the successful action of The Fed to cushion the blow. While higher interest rates discouraged borrowings and investments, personal loans remained unfazed. More households used credit cards for their essential and non-essential spending like leisure travel. And as the Fed Rate Hike Pause continues this holiday season, travel continues to boom. Hotels like Marriott are once again encouraged to increase their capacity to accommodate more guests.\n\nGiven all these, Marriott is taking advantage of all market opportunities. As of 3Q23, its occupancy rate was already 72.1% compared to 68.9% in 3Q22. It was still much lower than in 3Q19 with 76.0% since the economy has yet to stabilize amid recession woes. The continued expansion of Marriott also contributed to the wide gap. With the continued travel uptrend and increased property construction of MAR, it is poised to fully recover by 2025. It still has a lot of growth drivers, which we will discuss thoroughly in the succeeding parts.\n\nEven better, it kept costs and expenses reasonable relative to the continued expansion. MAR showed increased efficiency with easing cost pressures as it expanded. Its prudent and competitive hotel rates helped it cover and outweigh costs and expenses. Also, the slowing inflation helped it manage variable costs better. In turn, the operating margin remained stable with a slight increase from 18.1% in 3Q22 and 18.0% in 2Q23 to 18.5% in 3Q23. Indeed, MAR enjoys solid top-line growth. As MAR increases its hotels and rooms, it has more upside in 4Q22 and the whole of FY24.\n\nMAR has endured the blows of the pandemic recession, exacerbated by zero-tolerance restrictions. But over the next three years, it has regained its footing. Although it hasn't reached pre-pandemic levels, the consistent uptrend is remarkable. It's no surprise it is poised to complete its recovery in about a year or two. The important thing is that it continues to generate high revenues while keeping costs and expenses manageable. This is an essential attribute amid the still elevated prices and interest rates. These are some of the things I consider to say Marriott is a solid company.\n\nCost reimbursements comprise 74% of Marriott's total revenue, showing it uses a managed-based model. But in reality, the majority of its business runs a fee-based model. Over 70% of revenues are from base management, franchise, and incentive fees. To prevent confusion, you may read here to better understand how cost reimbursement works for MAR. Cost reimbursement tends to understate MAR's operating income. But it also gives a clearer picture of Marriott's revenue generation from its franchisees, lessees, and customers and how it allocates it to employees.\n\nI like its fee-based model since this is very favorable for the company at this point. Tourism is booming. Revenge travel is resilient. More people are planning to travel next year. It is also flexible to macroeconomic and market changes. Since many of its hotels are under its management, it can easily adjust rates to market demand. Also, it is secure even during economic downturns since franchise fees are constant payments to MAR. It may vary depending on the revenue generated by its franchisees. This gives it an edge over many of its peers, primarily Hyatt. The latter has a greater concentration on lease revenues, which are relatively inflexible than fee revenues.\n\nMeanwhile, Hilton also concentrates more on fees than leases. But if we get the percentage of their respective leases to revenues, MAR has only 6% while HLT has 13%. With that, MAR has more flexible revenue streams. We can see how advantageous a fee-based model is in their operating revenue. Both MAR and HLT had double-digit revenue growth in 3Q23, while Hyatt decreased by 5%. Hilton has a higher revenue increase of 12.7% versus MAR with 11.7%. Nonetheless, their actual revenue gap continued to widen. In 3Q22, MAR's revenue was higher by $2.94B. In 3Q23, it rose to $3.26B. Indeed, MAR continues to dominate the hotel industry.\n\nMarriott remains a formidable hotel with its fee-based model. But what makes it a durable giant is its sustained expansion and solid brand recognition. Its prudent pricing strategy on room rates allows it to compete even with smaller peers. We can see it in its impressive RevPAR growth. Its domestic growth was a bit slower than expected, but it rose by over 20% in Asia Pacific. It amounted to $129.73 and was higher than HLT with $121.37. Yet, both were much lower than H with $194, driven by its average daily rate. Even so, we must remember that the difference in the available rooms between MAR and H is still over one million.\n\nWhat makes MAR much ahead of the competition is its swift and sustained yet prudent expansion. It is a driving force toward growth as tourism recovers and returns to pre-pandemic levels. With the prevalent remote work setup, many employees can now go on vacation despite their busy schedules. MAR is ready after opening 73,652 new rooms. The total number of 1,581,002 is much higher than Hilton, with 1,159,783 (opened 48,636 new rooms), and Hyatt with 313,257 (18,369 new rooms). Its total properties are now 8,675 (built 503 new properties) versus HLT with 7,399 (built 338 new properties) and H with 1,310 (built 99 new properties). Hence, MAR has a much larger capacity to accommodate guests all over the world and generate more revenues.\n\nMarriott is a capital-intensive company, so liquidity is a crucial aspect to consider. Cash and borrowings substantially increased from 3Q22 to 3Q23. It can be discouraging at this point. Yet, we can attribute it to its increased spending and leverage to cover its expansion. Also, interest rates are still elevated. On a lighter note, its EBITDA rose by almost 30%, showing that its expansion had been fruitful. With that, its Net Debt/EBITDA decreased from 2.67x to 2.64x, both lower than the maximum of 3.5x-4.0x. This shows the company is earning enough to cover borrowings in a short period.\n\nOver the years, the stock market has been through crests and troughs, and MAR is no exception. Despite this, MAR and the whole S&P 500 (SPX) showed resilience as the economy recovered. Even better, MAR has shown double-digit and better-than-market-average stock price returns. I compared the ten-year historical prices of MAR to HLT, H, and SPX. I assessed their performance using their actual returns and volatility using the Sharpe Ratio, Treynor Ratio, and Jensen's Alpha.\n\nBy weighing their risks and returns, the three hotel stocks have outperformed the SPX. Even better, MAR remains the most solid stock with its impressive performance. As you can notice, MAR, HLT, and H have a negative Treynor Ratio due to negative beta. Their slope relative to the SPX is negative, so we can't determine which is the best stock among them. That is why I also used Jensen's Alpha and proved that MAR was the best stock among the three hotels.\n\nHotels and other lodging properties have been experiencing a boom in the past three months. Despite the initial worries about recession, travel spending remains resilient. Primary growth drivers are the pent-up demand for travel fueled by hybrid work prevalence and credit card accessibility. Marriott enjoys this trend with its impeccable revenue growth. These drivers can help the company sustain its growth and expansion.\n\nWinter travel expectations are still rosy even if the Summer and Autumn hype have already ebbed. The extremely cold weather does not seem to stop people globally from traveling this Winter. Various studies show that revenge travel is here to stay. One shows 83% of Americans planning to take at least one trip by the end of this year.\n\nAnother noticeable trend is that air travel is increasing faster than land travel. We can attribute it to the decreasing fuel prices, which help stabilize airfares. Right now, the number of domestic travelers is seen to be up by 2.2% from December 23 to January 1. More specifically, the number of people traveling by air this holiday season will reach 115.2 million. While it is still lower than the 2019 peak of 119 million, recovery is now within reach.\n\nIn addition, the demand for RVs has decreased after RV prices skyrocketed. For a while, people have chosen campsites and domestic destinations to cope with inflation. But as inflation decelerated and the RV prices became less appealing, more travelers turned to other destinations. This is an opportunity for hotels as they also compete with RVs, which serve both for driving and lodging.\n\nAnd now, artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming the crown jewel of many companies across different sectors. Even hotels are already seeing how AI can boost digital strategy, improve system integration, enhance efficiency to reduce costs, and reach out to more customers through social media and its more responsive web design. Marriott also embraces AI to personalize customer experience. For instance, it has extended to social media using organic and paid social content to generate potential customers. Collecting relevant email addresses and leveraging analytics are also part of it. AI can customize recommendations and offer more targeted services based on consumer behavior. It is often partnered with ChatGPT for better customer service and interaction.\n\nMore interestingly, Marriott uses AI algorithms to adjust room prices dynamically based on market demand and supply to increase revenues and occupancy rates. It helps the company keep room rates competitive while keeping its demand. MAR also uses AI to adjust staffing levels and assignments based on business needs.\n\nAs inflation stabilizes again, the Fed has kept policy rates unchanged again. Given this, it is easier for people and businesses to pay their borrowings and attract investments. It is more crucial for MAR, given the high capital intensity. This can help the company keep or even increase its liquidity level. Also, people will be more confident about using their credit cards for non-essential spending like travel amid holiday spending splurge.\n\nInflation has continuously decelerated from its 9.1% peak in June 2022. Despite this, policymakers are keen on the possibility of an inflation increase. Holiday spending splurges may drive this and may affect fuel prices. Also, fuel prices may be affected by the Winter demand. They must also keep watch of the Israel-Palestine War as the OPEC oil cuts remain a concern. If it persists, fuel prices may rebound and impact transportation and airfares. Although revenge travel remains solid, this may affect travel spending.\n\nAirbnb rooms are the primary competitors of the hotel industry. They cater to many backpackers and those who wish to lodge at a more manageable price. They can be predatory and work against hotels. Thankfully, MAR appears to be ahead of the competition as it has already started offering private home rentals in 2019. It is crucial to join this niche to ensure the company can keep customer base.\n\nThe stock price of Marriott has increased over the years. Despite the sudden drop due to the pandemic and inflationary headwinds in 2022, the stock kept rebounding. It has stayed in an uptrend allowing investors to generate returns. At $221.24, it has already risen by 43% in only a year. Investors may see the price a bit high to make a buy position. Yet, MAR still shows promising upside potential. These are supported by the key drivers and the impressive aspects discussed in the previous section. MAR still has room to expand and generate more returns to support the stock price increase.\n\nIts PE Ratio of 23.44x is also much cheaper than that of HLT at 35.79x and H at 28.98x. With that, MAR is still trading at a more reasonable price relative to its earnings. And to better assess the stock price of Marriott, I used the DCF Model since MAR is capital-intensive. The DCF Model is a better method to analyze the intrinsic value of the company. I derived the growth rate in line with the target inflation of the US Fed. Also, I expect MAR's revenue growth to normalize in the next five years. The double-digit growth shows MAR is still in its recovery phase toward pre-pandemic highs. Meanwhile, I derived the WACC by getting the debt and equity components using the Capital Asset Pricing Model.\n\nThe screenshot shows how I got the target price of $304.12. I also made a sensitivity table to demonstrate how the price will vary with the growth rate and WACC. We can see that the stock price remains undervalued regardless of the percentage. The target price shows that the upside potential of the stock price is still high by 36%, so MAR is still an excellent buy.\n\nMarriott International, Inc. remains a formidable figure in the hotel industry. With its massive size and sustained expansion, it caters to a wide range of customers based on their preferences and capacity. It also maintains adequate liquidity to cover its business operations, dividends, and borrowings. Also, it has enticing growth drivers, which may allow MAR to generate more revenues. Travel is still on its way to pre-pandemic peak, and its current trajectory shows MAR will reach it in no time. Even better, the stock price remains bullish and has many upside drivers. That is why I still recommend Marriott as a great buy.",

        "title": "'Third way': Turkey's whirling dancers celebrate mystic Rumi's tolerance",
        "body": "The skirts of whirling dervishes twirl in a symphony of disco colours celebrating mystic Sufi poet Rumi at a cultural centre in central Turkey's Konya.\n\nEvery year, the \"Seb-i Arus\" (\"Wedding Night\") festival honouring Rumi's death on December 17, 1273, draws so many people that traditional venues are not large enough to contain the crowds.\n\nPilgrims, tourists, meditation enthusiasts and the curious flock to this vast Anatolian city, where Rumi -- or Mevlana as he is known in Turkey -- spent most of his life after being driven out of modern-day Afghanistan in the 12th century by Mongol invaders.\n\nHis writings have gradually spread well beyond central Asia and won acclaim in the West. Pop legend Madonna adapted one of Rumi's poems and Beyonce named her daughter after him.\n\n\"Rumi's works have been translated into almost every language, and in the United States alone more than 250 books are dedicated to him,\" said Nuri Simsekler, a specialist in Persian literature at Konya's Selcuk University.\n\n\"Rumi speaks to all humans, telling us about ourselves,\" Simsekler said of Rumi's enduring popularity seven centuries after his death.\n\n- Dance ritual -\n\nThe \"sema\" rituals -- which honour Rumi's legacy -- are performed by whirling dervishes who don a tall light brown hat, with their arms elegantly spread.\n\nThe order was established after Rumi's death by his son and descendants.\n\nTo the sounds of reed flutes and tambourines, the dervish takes off his long black cloak to dance, but keeps his cylindrical felt hat on. The \"sikke\" represents the tombstone which will one day stand at the head of his grave.\n\nThen the dance begins. Extending his right hand toward the sky and his left towards the ground, the whirling dervish forms a link between the two.\n\n\"Rumi is the first person on Earth whose death is not mourned but celebrated,\" Simsekler said.\n\nFrom her office window, Esin Celebi Bayru has a clear view of the turquoise dome that tops the mausoleum of her illustrious ancestor.\n\nLarge crowds from Turkey and Iran -- where the poet is also a national icon -- but also Britain and Singapore are expected to celebrate Rumi's 750th \"Wedding Night\" with God at his tomb.\n\nSuch a major anniversary of his death was \"an opportunity to make him even better known,\" said Celebi Bayru, a 22nd generation descendant of the Sufi poet.\n\nShe and her brother co-chair the Mevlana International Foundation, created in 1996 in Konya to perpetuate Rumi's legacy.\n\n\"In these times of war, Mevlana's word is like a light for us,\" she said of his many appeals for tolerance and peace. \"People come here from all over the world.\"\n\n- Prayer or meditation-\n\nCelebi Bayru said she has recently been invited to lecture in places as distant as Hawaii, Australia, India and Pakistan.\n\nEvery year, she also receives film scripts, and hopes one day to see a biopic of Rumi brought to the screen.\n\nEverywhere in Konya, souvenirs bearing the image of Rumi and dervishes fill stalls.\n\nIronically, the most famous master of Sufism -- who taught tolerance with the words \"come, come, whoever you are, wanderer, worshipper, lover of leaving\" -- is honoured in a city with one of Turkey's most staunchly conservative Sunni traditions.\n\nIn front of his immense green and gold tomb, a grumpy Sunni pilgrim curses as Rumi's followers sit on the ground, eyes closed, fingers pointing to the sky.\n\n\"This is not a place for meditation, it's for prayer,\" the Sunni pilgrim complained.\n\nThe incident only makes sheikh Mehmet Fatih Citlak smile.\n\nUnder a headdress lined with 20 metres of braided green ribbons, he presides over more spiritual \"semas\" at the Irfan Study and Research Centre in Konya, where prayers are interspersed with music and songs.\n\n\"We don't just twirl around all day,\" laughed the sheikh, who was recently invited to perform at Oxford University by its art history department.\n\n\"But as long as we stick to our discipline, we don't mind the public,\" he added, saying that \"between art and love, Mevlana offered us a third way.\n\n\"Everyone interprets him in their own way,\" he said.\n\n\"But if he were better understood, would the world be in the state it is in today?\"\n\nach/fo/zak/fg\n\nMore from this section\n\nWATCH: Central Cabarrus' Daniel twins discuss Hickory Ridge win, Chambers game Israel army says biggest Hamas tunnel found Cold Snap Blankets Beijing in Snow While South China Feels the Heat - TaiwanPlus News",

        "title": "'We're very lucky': He's 104, she's 100, and they've been married for 82 years",
        "body": "LOS ANGELES -- As a lively group of elderly women scurried onto a shuttle for a shopping day on a recent Tuesday afternoon, Carla and Jack Weingarten could be found snuggled under a blanket inside their Los Angeles apartment, watching \"I Love Lucy\" episodes on repeat.\n\nCarla, who's 100, and Jack, who turns 105 on Dec. 25, used to look forward to their retirement community's weekly outings. But these days, they prefer a more laid-back afternoon: Sitting side by side in their recliner chairs and watching one of Carla's favorite shows -- Jack mostly just listens because he's lost much of his vision -- as they hold hands for hours.\n\nIn August, Carla and Jack celebrated a major milestone: 82 years of marriage.\n\n\"We're very lucky,\" said Carla, who has short-term memory loss. Then she leaned over toward her husband to encourage him to chime in.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he said in agreement, before kissing her hand tenderly. Jack, whose speech and memory have faded in recent years, used to tell their two sons that the key to a healthy marriage is \"the man always having the last word: 'Yes dear.'\" Jack doesn't talk much nowadays, but when he does, he's typically calling out for Carla or telling her that he loves her multiple times a day.\n\n\"I love you too, Jackie,\" she always responds.\n\nAn estimated 17,000 centenarians live in California, with nearly 6,500 of them in Los Angeles County, according to the California Department of Finance. That number gets even smaller -- roughly 25% as estimated by the Census Bureau's American Community Survey -- when it comes to how many Californians ages 90 and up are still married. According to the Guinness World Records, the longest documented marriage in the world is 86 years.\n\nIn other words, Carla and Jack's long-lasting relationship is somewhat of an anomaly.\n\nThe couple's Hollywood-like love story began in Vienna, where Jack and Carla had been neighbors and family friends since they were kids. Their families also attended the same synagogue, though they didn't pay much attention to each other due to their five-year age difference.\n\nThe family story goes like this: Around 1936, a teenage Jack moved to what was then known as Mandatory Palestine on the advice of a teacher because antisemitism was rapidly rising in Austria and neighboring Germany. Carla fled there a few years later during World War II. Her father thought she'd be safest there because she spoke Hebrew. He'd later be killed in a concentration camp, along with her mother, younger brother and grandparents. Before Carla left Austria, Jack's mother asked her to give him a letter. His mother didn't know exactly where he was living, but she hoped Carla would find him.\n\nSoon after she arrived, Carla ran into one of Jack's childhood friends, who told her where he was, and they reunited. Carla doesn't remember what she thought of Jack when she saw him again, but his reaction was laced with the charming sense of humor he's known for, according to their sons. \"You look a lot better now,\" Jack said to 17-year-old Carla. Knowing that she didn't have any family or resources at the time, Jack told her, \"Don't worry. I'll take care of you,\" and he suggested they get married.\n\nThey tied the knot on Aug. 12, 1941, and had their first son, Joel, four years later, then their second son, Henry, in 1950. The young family moved to New York City in 1958 and made their way to Los Angeles a few months later. Jack worked for a children's apparel company, which he eventually took over, while Carla worked as a seamstress and pattern maker. She also taught sewing classes in their garage.\n\n\"They struggled moving to America, but what I respected was that they never brought that to their children,\" said Joel. Unlike some of his friends' parents, Carla and Jack didn't remind him and his brother about the sacrifices they'd made for them, he added. \"I never heard anything from my parents about what they went through. They never looked back, they only looked forward.\"\n\nJack and Carla had a vibrant social life until a couple years ago. First, Jack hurt his head after two falls and had to recuperate during days-long hospital stays. Then he got COVID-19 and pneumonia. But before all that, Jack played bridge competitively for several years. He and Carla would go to every social event at their independent living community and encourage others to attend. If there was a dance floor, they were always on it. \"They're such a loved couple here,\" said Deborah Rivera, the community's business manager. She's known them since they moved into the retirement complex nearly 15 years ago.\n\nThe couple used to travel regularly to places like Hawaii, Austria and Germany, and they have friends of various ages around the world. They've outlived many of their longtime friends. Fluent in multiple languages, including German, Hebrew and French, they typically speak to each other in German.\n\nPhotos from their trips, along with smiling images of their sons, daughters-in-law and three granddaughters, adorn every square foot of their spacious two-bedroom apartment. Carla used to love making personalized cards on her desktop computer for her loved ones' birthdays, but she no longer does that these days.\n\n\"We're lucky,\" Carla said of their lives. \"We thank God. We have no complaints. We have a good place here. We enjoy being here with the people. We have good friends.\"\n\nCarla still exercises every day, and regularly gets her hair and nails done at the community's salon. And when her husband falls asleep in the evenings, she usually goes downstairs to catch up with her friends over a glass of wine. Three other centenarians live at the senior complex, but Carla and Jack are the only married couple, Rivera said.\n\nThe word \"tenderness\" comes to Rivera's mind when she thinks about the Weingartens. They have a \"spark of love that's still there after all these years,\" Rivera said. \"But with them, it's so pure. It's so genuine. You see that they truly just enjoy each other so much still. You see them walking down the hall, they're always holding hands, which is so sweet to see.\"\n\n\"I think that's what is keeping them alive,\" added their son, Joel. \"The fact they have each other.\"\n\nCarla and Jack's marriage has also made an impact on their three grandchildren.\n\n\"We all kind of look up to them as a success story and something to strive for because they do love each other so much and really do enjoy each other's company and waking up next to each other,\" said granddaughter Ashton Cohen-Weingarten, 33.\n\n\"They're so committed to each other,\" added her sister, 30-year-old Lindsay Cohen-Weingarten. \"They grew up together and now they've grown old together, and their relationship remains so strong. [Their marriage] has taught me unconditional love.\"\n\nWillie Coronado, one of Carla and Jack's caregivers, has also picked up a few gems from them. Jack told Coronado, who's been married for 23 years, that the secret to \"living happily ever after\" is making sure \"that when you go to bed at night with your wife, things are settled. Don't go to bed upset.\"\n\n\"That's something I keep with me all the time,\" said Coronado, who's worked with the couple for more than a decade. \"I know it's not easy, but I know he has so much wisdom in those words.\"\n\nBack in Carla and Jack's cozy apartment, Lucille Ball bounced on the TV screen in their living room. While a housekeeper tidied up their bedroom and a caretaker prepared their lunch, Jack began drifting off to sleep as he and his wife held hands. He didn't let go -- and neither did she.",

These forward-looking statements include, but are not limited to, statements regarding the satisfaction of conditions to the completion of the proposed transaction and the expected completion of the proposed transaction, the timing and benefits thereof, as well as other statements that are not historical fact. These forward-looking statements can be identified by the fact that they do not relate to historical or current facts.

These statements are based on assumptions and assessments made by Renesas and/or Sequans (as applicable) in light of their experience and perception of historical trends, current conditions, future developments and other factors they believe appropriate.

Such forward-looking statements involve known and unknown risks and uncertainties that could significantly affect expected results and are based on certain key assumptions. Such risks and uncertainties include, but are not limited to, the potential failure to satisfy conditions to the completion of the proposed transaction due to the failure to receive a sufficient number of tendered shares in the tender offer; the failure to obtain necessary regulatory or other approvals; the outcome of legal proceedings that may be instituted against Sequans and/or others relating to the transaction; the possibility that competing offers will be made; potential adverse reactions or changes to business relationships resulting from the announcement or completion of the proposed transaction; significant or unexpected costs, charges or expenses resulting from the proposed transaction; and negative effects of this announcement or the consummation of the proposed acquisition on the market price of Sequans' ADS and ordinary shares. Many factors could cause actual results to differ materially from those projected or implied in any forward-looking statements. Among the factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those described in the forward-looking statements are changes in the global, political, economic, business and competitive environments, market and regulatory forces, future exchange and interest rates, changes in tax rates and future business combinations or dispositions.

When I started working on my list this season, I discovered that nearly all of my favorite four-stars from the past few years have now left the building. I hope they're enjoying their retirement, as their successors toil endlessly on all the problems of today's world.\n\nThe elves have been putting in lots of overtime to help me figure out the best gifts for so many new people this year, but they've done a great job!

After almost three years on the job, Santa is amazed that this guy just keeps on going and going -- and that nothing seems to stick to him! Rudolph suggested giving him some Teflon spray, but he doesn't seem to need it! What he might need, though, is an extra dose of energy to get through year four. Thankfully, the North Pole G4 still has a few extra cases of what we delivered to servicemembers in Iraq and Afghanistan for years: Monster energy drinks! Just slam one or two down before that next meeting in the Sit Room to keep you going!\n\nNational Security Advisor Jake Sullivan. Poor Jake. Every month seems to give you a new major crisis, from Ukraine to Gaza to ... well, who knows what is coming next? Between your globe-trotting to arm-twist allies to your late nights in the West Wing, Santa is really starting to worry about your health and the looks of your skinny frame! So Santa is prescribing a a week of mandatory vacation in the teepees at Shenandoah National Park, far away from any SCIFs and way out of cell phone range\n\nSecretary of State Antony Blinken. Yeah, you're a fine diplomat. But I've just stumbled upon some secret intelligence that your true talent in life is playing the electric guitar! But you gotta loosen up, man -- what would your idol Eric Clapton think about you jamming while wearing a fully buttoned-up suit?!? So we're going to set you up with the folks who created the spectacular outfits that Beyoncé wore during the Renaissance tour this summer. As you travel the world for your new Global Music Diplomacy Tour Initiative, you'll have the perfect look for any occasion -- polka dots and pearls when you want to have some fun, rhinestones for those formal events, and that bee outfit just for the hell of it.\n\nChairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Gen. C.Q. Brown. Welcome to another incredibly thankless military job! By my count, your fun meter should already be nearly pegged out -- you've already suffered through more than three years of E-Ring craziness as the Air Force chief, and now you're looking at nearly four more as chairman! Glad I'm not you! But one cool thing you get to do is publish a Chairman's Reading List for the joint force. Santa was surprised to recently find that the list hasn't actually been updated since 2012, so you'll definitely look smarter than Dunford and Milley! Santa will be dropping two books down your chimney this year: a copy of Smile for No Good Reason, for you and your fellow joint chiefs to pass around during your next Tank session; and, with Santa wincing about what your world might look like in January 2025, a copy of You Can Be Happy No Matter What.\n\nChief of Staff of the Army Gen. Randy George. Sure, Army beat Navy this year, but now it's time to get back to the only real game that counts: recruiting! You know it's bad when one of the best Duffel Blog stories of the year involved a kid dressed up for Halloween as an Army recruiter and missing his candy target by 20 percent! I'm thinking that this problem must have something to do with persuading young folks about the virtues of crawling under barbed wire in the mud and sleeping on the ground in the rain, no? The elves are busily working the printing presses so that you can give each of your recruiters copies of two books: How to Suffer Outside: A Beginner's Guide to Hiking and Backpacking, and How to Do Things You Hate: Self-Discipline to Suffer Less, Embrace the Suck, and Achieve Anything.\n\nChief of Naval Operations Adm. Lisa Franchetti. Okay, I get that you're new on the job. But one of your top priorities should be firing whomever thought it would be smart to make Navy's game-day uniforms a tribute to the \"Silent Service.\" Yes, submariners are cool. But honestly, most Americans now think that the only people actually in the Navy are a handful of fighter pilots from Top Gun: Maverick and about a million really low-ego Navy SEALs. No wonder you're having recruiting problems too -- you gotta tell people about ships! After all, you're the only service with pretty much guaranteed workspace air conditioning! So Santa will also be giving you gifts for your recruiters: a combat task force model kit, and a spiffy updated version of the classic game Battleship.\n\nCommandant of the Marine Corps Gen. Eric Smith. General, Santa sends only his best wishes to you to complete your speedy recovery and get back to your E-Ring office soon. You have given more than anyone could ask to your Marines, and all of us at the North Pole are hoping that your holiday season will be filled with family, fun, and time for lots of rest. To help you through your physical therapy, we'll be dropping off a personalized Marine PT uniform and a Marine drill sergeant teddy bear to help you along.\n\nThe \"Chowder II\" Marine Retired Generals. Santa tries not pick on old guys, because after all, I have a white beard too! But this crew deserves an exception. Just when did the 248-year tradition of standing behind the commandant and his decisions get blown up? I should have given this to you guys years ago, but better late than never. You'll each receive a copy of STFU: The Power of Keeping Your Mouth Shut in an Endlessly Noisy World. You'll also get a case of Santa's favorite bourbon barrel-aged triple Belgian stout, also aptly named STFU -- an appropriate brew for all of you aging critics of the current and former commandants' plans to transform the Marines for warfare in this century.\n\nChief of Staff of the Air Force Gen. David Allvin and Chief of the National Guard Bureau Army Gen. Dan Hokanson. This Santa two-fer is going to help you guys plug all the security holes in the Air National Guard that you both own. Who would have thought that a junior airman 1st class at an obscure National Guard base in Massachusetts could have shared some of the nation's most sensitive intelligence with an online gamers chat on Discord? Your security training surely needs an upgrade, but we know money is tight, since the cost of those F-35s just keeps going up! I have the perfect solution: train all of your security professionals on how to detect spies who lie using the Clue Liar's Editionboard game, alongside a special Air Force version of Google's Liar Sound button! Even that has to be better than what you've been using until now.\n\nU.S. Northern Command Commander Gen. Glen VanHerck. Santa thought he was reading the Duffel Blog when he spotted the story of the clandestine daytime bar called the \"John Wayne Saloon\" inside NORAD headquarters. Seriously?? This is personal for me, since I rely on you to defend my airspace every Christmas Eve! When I fly over your headquarters this year, you'll be getting a copy of Alcoholism in the Workplace: A Handbook for Supervisors, alongside copies of these recommended books on sobriety to distribute to your subordinates.\n\nU.S. Central Command Commander Gen. Eric Kurilla. Last year, Santa worried that you had so little to do that you were training to be a submarine skipper. But the Middle East is back, baby! Israel battling Hamas, Houthi rebels launching missiles at U.S. ships, Iranian militias rocketing the U.S. embassy, and American troops in Iraq -- you have a full plate, and once again a full AOR. To cheer up your demoralized forces who had all started learning Mandarin, Santa is trying to convince a world-famous football girlfriend to go on a USO tour of your battlespace. I can't say who it is yet, since confidential negotiations are ongoing, but let's just say you might consider calling it \"Eras 2: The Combat Tour\"!\n\nU.S. Strategic Command Commander Gen. Anthony Cotton. I know you and your staff didn't get out much this past summer, what with opening a new center on electromagnetic threats, planning a conference on deterrence, and, you know, saving the planet from nuclear Armageddon. So you will all be spending Christmas Day at a movie theater in downtown Omaha, where Santa has arranged a special Barbenheimer double feature! Oppie's up first, which you can totally justify as professional development. Then refill your popcorn buckets and get ready to party at the Mojo Dojo Casa House, at least until Barbie singlehandedly dismantles the patriarchy. You'll feel the Kenergy in no time!\n\nSen. Tommy \"Coach\" Tuberville. You get nothing but a lump of coal from me. But those troublemakers named Barno and Bensahel wrote a holiday poem about you (with a little help from Theodor Geisel) that is truly a gift to everyone in uniform who suffered during your inexcusable hold on military promotions. Read it here.\n\nSo there you have it! The elves and I hope that we made you smile as we poked a bit of gentle fun at many of the big names in the natsec community. We hope that all of them, and all of you, find a way to celebrate this holiday season in style, be close to those you love, and cherish all of our many blessings. From all of us here at the North Pole (and your loyal Strategic Outpost columnists), best wishes for the holidays and a bright and happy New Year!",

Once Delta restores its operations to Tel Aviv (not until March 2024 at the earliest), EL AL customers can fly on these services too.\n\nAlain Bellemare, Delta President - International, commented,\n\n\"Delta remains steadfast in our long-time commitment to serving consumers and businesses who depend on convenient, high-quality air service to and from Tel Aviv. Through our codeshare agreement with EL AL, we will offer customers more convenient travel options between North America and Israel.\"\n\nOnce this happens, EL AL passengers will be able to travel on approximately 280 same-day connections from Delta's hubs in Atlanta (ATL), Boston, and New York JFK, including key airports like Dallas/Fort Worth (DFW), San Francisco (SFO) and Toronto (YYZ).\n\nPhoto: Davidi Vardi | Shutterstock\n\nThe agreement will commence on January 1st, with frequent flyer benefits beginning two weeks later on January 15th.

Despite this, some international carriers are preparing to return to Israel, including Lufthansa Group airlines which will resume service in early January.\n\nDiscover more aviation news with Simple Flying.\n\nCodeshare expansion coming?\n\nAs Simple Flying reported in November, the two airlines submitted a request to the US Department of Transportation (DOT) which included a proposal to codeshare on flights outside of the US and Israel.

        "body": "Keeping abreast of the latest artificial intelligence (AI) developments in this rapidly changing area of law is critical. This newsletter highlights recent updates in AI regulation, covering major AI developments in the United States, China, Europe and elsewhere.\n\nUnited States\n\nWhite House Executive Order -- President Joe Biden signed an executive order on Oct. 30 titled \"Safe, Secure & Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence\" (the Order). The Order outlines a comprehensive approach to managing the development and deployment of AI in a manner that is safe, secure, ethical and beneficial to society. The Order establishes safety and security standards, seeks to protect privacy and civil rights, and requires federal agencies to complete a number of tasks that will govern public release of AI tools and the federal government's procurement of those tools.\n\nSafety and Security\n\nThe Order requires all companies developing any AI tool that poses a serious risk to national security, economic security or public health and safety to notify and share the results of safety tests with the government before releasing their products. The Order establishes eight guiding principles to govern AI development, focusing on safety, security, ethical use and compliance with federal laws. The National Institute of Standards and Technology must set standards to ensure that AI tools are safe before public release, which the Department of Homeland Security will also enforce in critical infrastructure sectors.\n\nCivil Rights and Equality\n\nThe Order requires the Department of Justice and federal civil rights offices to coordinate on best practices for investigating and prosecuting civil rights violations related to AI and for using AI in a wide range of policing and criminal justice contexts. The Order promises to provide clear guidance to landlords, federal benefits programs and federal contractors to keep AI algorithms from being used to exacerbate discrimination.\n\nConsumer Protection\n\nThe Order requires the Department of Health and Human Services to establish a program to monitor and address unsafe health care practices stemming from AI. The Department of Labor must develop best practices to mitigate the harms and maximize the benefits that AI can cause for workers and to write guidelines for federal contractors to prevent discrimination in AI-driven hiring systems. The Order requires certain agencies to address bias caused by using AI for the sale of financial products and encourages the Federal Communications Commission to consider using AI to block unwanted robocalls and texts.\n\nTransparency\n\nThe Order directs the Department of Commerce to develop guidance for authenticating and labeling AI-generated content to avert fraud and deception.\n\nInnovation and Competition\n\nThe Order encourages responsible innovation and competition in AI, with a focus on investments in AI education, training and research, while addressing intellectual property challenges. The Order seeks to spur a \"government-wide AI talent surge,\" encourages AI deployment that respects workers' rights and benefits workers, and streamlines visa requirements for foreign workers with AI expertise.\n\nCongressional and Federal Agency Action on AI -- Congressional committees in both the House and Senate have held nearly three dozen hearings on AI-related topics since January 2023. Multiple lawmakers have introduced separate frameworks for comprehensive AI legislation. Several AI bills have been voted on and passed through committees. Although it remains to be seen what legislation will ultimately pass, AI regulation is a priority for the U.S. Congress.\n\nThe Securities and Exchange Commission also proposed rules to address the AI use by broker-dealers and investment advisers. The rules identify five specific risks -- bias, conflicts of interest, financial fraud, privacy and intellectual property concerns -- and would require broker-dealers and advisers to eliminate the effect of certain conflicts of interest associated with their use of AI and other technologies that optimize, predict, guide, forecast or direct investment-related behaviors or outcomes.\n\nSecurities and Exchange Commission Chair Gary Gensler recently warned businesses against misleading investors regarding their AI use or capabilities. Gensler reinforced that public disclosures regarding AI are governed by the same securities laws that govern all public disclosures. Gensler referred to misleading AI disclosures as \"AI-washing,\" a reference to the practice of greenwashing, in which a business misrepresents how environmentally friendly its operations are. Gensler noted gaps between the AI capabilities that businesses are promising versus what they can deliver and gaps between investor knowledge of AI and the latest AI technologies, stating businesses must \"fairly and accurately describe the material risks\" of any AI offering or use.\n\nState and Local Action on AI -- California's governor signed an executive order similar to President Biden's that encourages AI innovation while setting standards for responsible development of AI tools and their adoption by state agencies. At least 12 state legislatures considered bills in 2023 to govern AI development and use, although none had passed.\n\nIllinois remains the only state to have passed a law, in 2019, specifically governing the use of AI in job recruiting contexts. The Illinois Artificial Intelligence Video Interview Act requires employers who use AI to analyze video interviews (which may include measuring an applicant's facial expression, word choice, body language and vocal tone, among other metrics) to provide notice to applicants, explain how AI is used, obtain consent before using AI on the video and destroy copies of the video within 30 days of an applicant's request. New York City passed a law in 2023 banning the use of AI for certain employment purposes unless notice, bias audit and reporting requirements are met.\n\nMost comprehensive state privacy laws restrict or prohibit the use of AI to make decisions significantly impacting consumers, including decisions in financial and lending services, housing, insurance, education, criminal justice, employment, health care services or access to basic necessities. In November 2023, the California Privacy Protection Agency, which is charged with enforcing California's state privacy law, released proposed regulations on the use of AI in these sectors. The proposed regulations would govern notice to consumers of AI use, when and how consumers can opt out of such use, and how consumers can access information about AI use by a business. The proposed regulations discuss how consumer data is used to train an AI tool and whether it can be used on children under the age of 16.\n\nEurope\n\nCompromise Reached on the EU AI Act -- On Dec. 8, various European legislators achieved a provisional compromise on legislation to govern AI in the European Union. Legislators first proposed the EU AI Act (the Act) in May 2023, focused on data quality, transparency, human oversight, accountability and ethical questions surrounding AI. The original draft of the Act took a risk-based approach, with greater requirements for AI systems or applications whose uses present higher risks to the health, safety and fundamental rights of individuals.\n\nIn November 2023, negotiations stalled over how to regulate foundational AI models, which are large deep-learning networks trained on a broad range of unlabeled data and capable of performing a wide variety of general tasks. AI systems and applications often rely on foundational models as a starting point to build more specialized platforms tailored to specific uses. EU member states with prominent foundational model companies, including France, Italy and Germany, proposed that the Act not regulate the underlying foundational models but instead focus on AI systems and applications that rely on those models, leaving the models to self-regulate through company pledges and codes of conduct. After three days of negotiations in early December, EU legislators settled on a provisional agreement under which all AI systems, including foundational models, will be regulated based on risk, with greater requirements for \"high impact\" foundational models. Some EU member states, such as France, have criticized the compromise and requested adjustments.\n\nApplying the EU AI Act -- European legislators are expected to finalize the Act in 2024, indicating that it will likely not take effect until 2026.\n\nWho must comply?\n\nThe Act has global reach and will apply to all providers, manufacturers, importers, distributors and deployers of AI systems that offer those systems in the EU or where the output is intended to be used in the EU. The Act applies across industries and includes companies not based in the EU. The Act defines AI systems broadly to include any machine-based system acting with a certain level of autonomy that generates outputs, such as predictions or decisions, in response to inputs. The Act does not apply to areas outside the scope of EU law, nor does it restrict member states' competence in national security systems used exclusively for military or defense purposes, for the sole purpose of research and innovation, or for people using AI for nonprofessional reasons.\n\nA risk-based approach\n\nThe Act creates four tiers of risk to regulate AI based on its use cases:\n\nFoundational models\n\nThe compromise reached in December 2023 added new requirements for foundational models, which must comply with certain transparency obligations before entering the market. Additionally, \"high impact\" foundational models, including those with above-average complexity and capabilities that are trained on large amounts of data, must meet heightened requirements under the assumption that they can disseminate systemic risks along the supply chain. These requirements are similar to those applied to high-risk use cases and include obligations to assess and mitigate systemic risks, report serious incidents, ensure cybersecurity, and provide information on the energy consumption of the high-impact model.\n\nPenalties for noncompliance\n\nNoncompliance with the Act may result in regulatory fines by EU member states or civil actions by individuals who are harmed by an AI system. Fines range from the greater of 7.5 million euros or 1.5% of global revenue and may increase to a maximum of the greater of 35 million euros or 7% of global revenue.\n\nChina\n\nManagement of Generative AI -- China's Interim Measures for the Management of Generative Artificial Intelligence Services (the Measures) took effect in August 2023. The Measures apply to the use of generative AI technologies to provide services to the public in China. \"Generative AI technology\" is broadly defined as models and technologies capable of generating content such as text, images, audio or video. However, industry organizations, enterprises, educational and scientific research institutions, public cultural institutions, and relevant professional institutions that develop and apply generative AI technology but do not provide generative AI services to the domestic public are not subject to the Measures.\n\nKey aspects of the Measures include:\n\nAs of December 2023, many news outlets report that China has taken a lax approach to enforcing the Measures, preferring instead to foster domestic technology innovation.\n\nOther Countries\n\nCanada, Israel and Brazil are currently contemplating draft legislation specifically aimed at AI. Others, including Australia, Japan and New Zealand, have clarified the application of existing data, privacy and intellectual property laws to AI use while considering \"soft law\" approaches such as non-proscriptive policies and general guidance. By contrast, the United Arab Emirates released a 46-page \"National Strategy for Artificial Intelligence\" that largely encourages AI development and attracting AI talent, with almost no regulation.",

        "body": "Rep. Bob Good (R-VA.) said on Monday that President Biden's border policy is the \"greatest harm ever done intentionally to the United States by any president.\"\n\nGood, the newly elected chair of the House Freedom Caucus, made the remarks during an appearance on NewsNation's \"The Hill,\" when host Blake Burman mentioned fellow Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene's (R-Ga.) recent comments on him, where she called out Good for being a traitor for endorsing Gov. Ron DeSantis (R) for president and not showing loyalty to former President Trump.\n\n\"Marjorie Taylor Greene is upset because Kevin McCarthy got removed from the speaker position, she backed him unconditionally. She's upset because she got kicked out of the Freedom Caucus,\" Good told Burman.\n\n\"But the bottom line is President Trump did a great job on immigration, did a great job on the border. Governor DeSantis did a great job in Florida, trying to fight...to that effect sending National Guard troops to the border, bussing illegals out of his state up into the northern states where they've said they want to be sanctuary states and sanctuary cities,\" Good added.\n\n\"Both would be a tremendous improvement over this current border invasion facilitated by this President. This is the greatest harm ever done intentionally to the United States by any president in our history.\"\n\nGood's remarks come as border security remains a central issue between the White House and the Senate as the upper chamber is vying to strike a potential deal that would send aid to Ukraine, Israel and implement border security measures.\n\nThe White House last month proposed a roughly $106 billion national security supplemental funding request that included money for Israel, Ukraine, and Taiwan as well as humanitarian aid and border security measures.\n\nRepublican lawmakers have shared their opposition to the proposed supplement deal, arguing border security measures need to be stricter if paired with aid for Ukraine and Israel.\n\nGood, while expressing his concern with Senate delay on the proposed deal, also urged the Senate to pass the Secure the Border Act of 2023, adding that they're not going to consider \"phony, pretend, weak, milquetoast, watered-down\" border security proposals.\n\nThe Hill show on NewsNation airs Monday to Friday at 5 p.m. EST.",

That's amazing!'\" she exclaimed with a laugh. \"I was like, 'I've done something right, that someone thinks I paid someone a lot of money to look like this.'\"\n\nIn her response to the comment on Instagram, Adrienne wrote, \"Wow ... this is the greatest compliment. My surgeon is @nyricanmama,\" and tagging her mom, Nilda Felix, in the reply.\n\nFor Adrienne, she feels the comment is reflective of the self-image issues that a lot of women in modern society struggle with.\n\n\"It just really [comes] down to the idea of women, we are so hard on ourselves, we beat ourselves up and to somebody else we probably look like a million bucks, or what they dream of, or what they think looks like plastic surgery or perfection,\" she shared. \"What they didn't see was the cellulite that was in the back of that photo. But that's just the reality of getting older and genetics. And I can thank my mom for that, too.\"\n\nAdrienne's excitement has been bolstered by her role as a mom, as well, after she and her husband, Israel Houghton, welcomed a baby boy, Ever, via surrogate in August 2022.\n\nReflecting on her life over the past year, Adrienne marveled, \"Oh my gosh, it's been a really special one. A little crazy but super special.\"\n\nThe singer said her experience with her young son has been \"so awesome\" -- even amid an accidental mishap that left her with a busted lip for the Daytime Emmy Awards.\n\n\"He head butted me this morning,\" she revealed. \"I had a busted lip this morning! But even in those moments, I'm like, 'Oh my god... I have a baby boy that head butts me and [yet] it's still beautiful.'\"",

Lakeview Super Senior: Yordi Dominguez Columbus High Super Senior: Brenyn Delano Aquinas places first, Blue River and SRC second at North Bend Scotus Super Senior: Joanna Rusher\n\nWASHINGTON -- U.S. senators late Monday said they are closer to an agreement on changes to immigration policy in order to clear a multibillion-dollar global security package, but any timing on a deal or details of that framework remained elusive.\n\n\"While the job is not finished, I'm confident that we're headed in the right direction,\" Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer said.\n\nSchumer, a New York Democrat, and Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky acknowledged that progress was made on immigration negotiations over the weekend, but they said that more time was needed for an agreement and to produce legislative text.\n\n\"Senate Republicans will not make up for others showing up late to the table by waiving our responsibility to carefully negotiate and review any agreement before voting on it,\" McConnell said.\n\nThe Biden administration is negotiating with a group of bipartisan senators to strike a deal that would tighten immigration restrictions and thus ease passage of more than $100 billion in emergency supplemental aid for Ukraine, Israel, Taiwan and U.S. border security.\n\nIf the package is punted to the New Year, it adds to Congress' growing list of difficult items, including two funding deadlines that could lead to a potential partial government shutdown if not met, and the White House has warned Ukraine has about a month of funding left unless Congress approves aid.\n\nThe talks on Capitol Hill follow recent comments from the Republican front-runner, former president Donald Trump, who has continued to use dehumanizing language toward immigrants -- most recently at a campaign stop in New Hampshire over the weekend. The anti-immigrant remarks echoed language in Adolf Hitler's memoir \"Mein Kampf.\"\n\nJust 61 senators vote\n\nSchumer kept the Senate in session to continue negotiations after the House left last week, and he did not indicate Monday if a vote on the supplemental would be held this week. Only 61 senators were in attendance for a vote Monday night to confirm former Maryland Gov. Martin O'Malley as commissioner for the Social Security Administration.\n\nSchumer said that there needs to be a \"middle ground\" and that both sides will have to make concessions.\n\nThe lead Senate negotiators are Sens. Chris Murphy, Democrat of Connecticut, Kyrsten Sinema, independent of Arizona and James Lankford, Republican of Oklahoma.\n\nLankford said there is currently no bill text and does not expect a vote to be held this week, but said that decision is ultimately up to Schumer. He also noted that there are currently only a handful of Senate Republicans in attendance.\n\nMurphy said that the Senate and the White House continue to \"make good progress,\" and that the group is working to get bill \"text as quickly as we can.\"\n\n\"I want to get this done as quickly as possible,\" he said. \"This set of law is so important and so complicated that you gotta get it right, not get it fast.\"\n\nMurphy declined to comment on specific proposals being discussed in negotiations, but potential changes to asylum law have drawn criticism from progressive and Latino Democrats who argue those proposals would raise the bar for migrants to claim asylum by making changes to the \"credible fear\" standard.\n\nLatino Democrats and immigration advocates have expressed their frustration with being shut out of negotiations and have warned the Biden administration that these negotiations could risk alienating young and Latino voters in next year's presidential election.\n\nThose lawmakers warned against a potential immigration deal that would resurrect a pandemic-era tool used by the Trump administration to expel millions of migrants, known as Title 42.\n\nGraham says senators 'not anywhere close to a deal'\n\nSouth Carolina's GOP Sen. Lindsey Graham said on NBC's \"Meet the Press\" Sunday that he did not think any deal on immigration policy would be made until the New Year.\n\n\"The bottom line here is we feel like we're being jammed, we're not anywhere close to a deal,\" Graham said.\n\nGraham noted that progress has been made, especially on changes to asylum, but for Republicans, \"there's a ways to go\" on the humanitarian parole authority that the Biden administration uses to grant temporary protections to people from certain countries. Republicans have wanted to curb the Biden administration's use of its humanitarian authority.\n\nThe Biden administration has used humanitarian parole to allow nationals from Haiti, Cuba, Nicaragua, Afghanistan, Ukraine and Venezuela to work temporarily in the U.S.\n\nGraham said that he believes the House will agree to Senate negotiations if there are changes to asylum and \"stop blanket (humanitarian) parole.\"\n\nSen. John Kennedy also expressed doubts that an agreement on immigration policy would be reached by the end of the week.\n\n\"It doesn't appear that we're gonna be able to land this plane before Christmas, but stranger things have happened,\" the Louisiana Republican said. \"So we'll see.\"\n\nSouth Dakota GOP Sen. Mike Rounds said he didn't think it was a good idea to negotiate a framework with the House out of session, pointing out that even if an agreement is reached, nothing can happen until the House comes back from its three-week recess.\n\n\"All it does is allow everybody to take potshots at whatever the deal is,\" Rounds said. \"We're trying to find common ground, but the bottom line is, this administration has known now for well over a month that the conditions require the Southern border to be dealt with.\"\n\nThe post Hopes dim even more for immigration agreement in US Senate before holidays appeared first on Nebraska Examiner.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Wire Dcc States-newsroom Tncen D.c.

        "body": "Haim Israel, head of global thematic research at Bank of America, expects 2024 to be a \"very important\" year for AI, specifically in regard to new generations of AI models and government regulation.\n\n2023 was an important year for artificial intelligence (AI), with McKinsey calling it a \"breakout year\" as some of the biggest tech companies in the U.S. rolled out new AI products and services. Yet, experts suggest we could still be in the early stages of the AI boom, anticipating an AI-fueled productivity surge could boost economic growth in 2024 and beyond.\n\nIn 2023, some of the biggest tech heavyweights in the U.S. by market capitalization, including Microsoft (MSFT), Alphabet (GOOGL), Meta (META), Amazon (AMZN), and Nvidia (NVDA), rolled out new AI products and services.\n\nBoosted by investor enthusiasm about their AI efforts, shares of all five companies were up 50% or more for 2023 going into the final two weeks of the year, with Nvidia and Meta leading the pack, with year-to-date gains of 250% and 176%, respectively, through the close of trading on Dec. 18.\n\nMicrosoft-backed OpenAI also released updated versions of ChatGPT this year following its launch in November 2022, offering significant improvements to the popular generative AI (GenAI) tool. CEO Sam Altman reported in November that there were over 100 million active weekly ChatGPT users and that more than 90% of Fortune 500 companies are building on OpenAI's products.\n\nAs AI evolves, more workers and companies are integrating it into their workflows, surveys show. More than half (56%) of U.S. workers said they use GenAI at work, and 42% of chief financial officers (CFOs) reported that their companies are exploring ways to use the tech. Consultants have even warned that companies waiting to adopt AI risk being left behind by competitors.\n\nAI quickly became one of the hottest investment themes of the year, with mentions of AI surging to record highs in earnings calls and views of the term on Investopedia's website soaring. Still, experts anticipate some of the biggest gains from AI could be yet to come.\n\nGoldman Sachs economists recently raised their global ten-year Gross Domestic Product (GDP) forecast due to the economic gains anticipated from AI integration, saying that their \"expectation is that generative AI will have a measurable macroeconomic impact.\"\n\nThe economists said they \"expect the impacts on productivity to be meaningful,\" estimating that AI could contribute to an increase of 1.5 percentage points in annual U.S. productivity growth if widespread adoption were achieved over the next decade.\n\nSeparately, McKinsey researchers reported that \"generative AI's impact on productivity could add trillions of dollars in value to the global economy,\" estimating that genAI could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually.\n\n\"Generative AI could enable labor productivity growth of 0.1 to 0.6 percent annually through 2040, depending on the rate of technology adoption and redeployment of worker time into other activities. Combining generative AI with all other technologies, work automation could add 0.2 to 3.3 percentage points annually to productivity growth,\" McKinsey projected.\n\nGenAI \"could ultimately automate roughly 25% of work tasks\" in major developed markets like the U.S., Goldman economists estimated, anticipating that greater automation will \"drive labor cost savings and free up workers' time, some of which will likely be allocated to new tasks.\"\n\nAs AI rapidly evolves, it may be difficult to anticipate the technology's future capabilities and impacts, but Haim Israel, head of global thematic research at Bank of America, expects 2024 will be \"very important\" for AI, specifically in regard to new generations of AI models and government regulation.\n\n\"For generative AI we really see all the stars aligning to create a massive revolution,\" Israel told Investopedia, saying that \"never [has a] technology [been] adopted so fast\" and \"it's developing in warp-speed.\"\n\nA major \"discussion in 2024 is also going to be about the next generation of AI-based technologies\" which could include emotionally intelligent AI and simulation, which provides data for sectors where datasets are unavailable, Israel noted.\n\nAnother facet that Israel expects to be at the forefront of AI in the new year is regulation, as governments work to safeguard against potential harms brought on by widescale AI adoption.\n\nUpcoming elections could highlight concerns around AI and privacy as well as misinformation, Israel noted, saying that \"2024 is going to be a year that regulators across the world will have to start addressing\" the impacts of AI.",

        "title": "Revolutionizing Green Energy: A New Hydrogen Fuel Cell Breaskthrough",
        "body": "A breakthrough in hydrogen fuel cell technology, achieved through collaborative research, has substantially lowered costs by replacing platinum metals with silver in catalysts, marking a significant step towards affordable and efficient green energy storage.\n\nAs the global shift towards renewable energy sources gains momentum, there arises a crucial challenge: how to store energy effectively for periods when solar and wind power aren't available.\n\nOne leading contender, the hydrogen fuel cell, just got a big boost, thanks to fundamental research stemming from the Department of Energy's SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory, Stanford University, and the Toyota Research Institute (TRI), that was recently translated to practice in a fuel cell device via a collaboration between Stanford and Technion Israel Institute of Technology.\n\n\"Hydrogen fuel cells have really great potential for energy storage and conversion, using hydrogen as an alternative fuel to, say, gasoline,\" said Michaela Burke Stevens, an associate scientist with SLAC and Stanford University's joint SUNCAT Center for Interface Science and Catalysis and one of the senior authors on the study. \"But it's still fairly expensive to run a fuel cell.\"\n\nThe problem, Burke Stevens said, is that fuel cells typically rely on a catalyst - packed with expensive platinum group metals (PGM) - that boosts the chemical reaction that makes the system work. That led Burke Stevens and her colleagues to search for ways to make the catalyst cheaper, but making such a fundamental change to a fuel cell's chemistry is a daunting challenge: Scientists often find a catalyst that works in their small lab setup doesn't work out so well when a company tries it in a real-world fuel cell.\n\nThis time, the researchers balanced costs, by partially replacing PGMs with a cheaper alternative, silver; but the real key was to simplify the chemical recipe for getting the catalyst onto the cell's electrodes.\n\nScientists typically mix the catalyst into a liquid and then spread it onto the mesh electrode, but these catalyst recipes don't always play out the same way in different lab environments with different tools - making it difficult to translate the work into real-world applications. \"Wet chemical processes are not particularly resilient with respect to laboratory conditions,\" said Tom Jaramillo, director of SUNCAT, which made the collaboration possible.\n\nTo get around that issue, the SLAC team instead used a vacuum chamber for more controlled depositions of their new catalyst onto electrodes. \"This high-vacuum tool is a very 'what you see is what you get' type of method,\" said Jaramillo. \"As long as your system is calibrated well, in principle, people can reproduce it readily.\"\n\nTo ensure that others could reproduce their approach and apply it directly to full-scale fuel cells, the team worked with experts at Technion, who showed that the method worked in a practical fuel cell.\n\n\"This project was not set up to do the fuel cell testing here, so we were really fortunate that the lead Stanford graduate student on the project, José Zamora Zeledόn, formed a connection with Dario Dekel and his PhD student John Douglin at Technion. They were set up to test the actual fuel cells, so it was a really nice combination of resources to put together,\" said Burke Stevens.\n\nTogether, the two teams found that by substituting cheaper silver for some of the PGMs used in previous catalysts, they could achieve an equally effective fuel cell with a much lower price tag -and now that they have a proven method of developing catalysts, they can start testing more ambitious ideas.\n\n\"We could try going entirely PGM-free,\" said Jaramillo. Dekel, a chemical engineering professor and director of the Grand Technion Energy Program at Technion, was equally excited by the partnership's potential. \"This has great benefits for the research of fuel cells in the academy as well as for practical catalyst development in the fuel cell industry,\" he said.\n\nLooking forward, Jaramillo said, research like this will decide whether fuel cells can fulfill their potential. \"Fuel cells are really looking exciting and interesting for heavy-duty transportation and clean energy storage,\" said Jaramillo, \"but it's ultimately going to come down to lowering cost, which is what this collaborative work is all about.\"\n\nReference: \"High-performance ionomerless cathode anion-exchange membrane fuel cells with ultra-low-loading Ag-Pd alloy electrocatalysts\" by John C.

        "title": "Other voices: Congress must approve military aid package",
        "body": "New York Times\n\nThe Biden administration has asked Congress to approve a $105 billion military aid package, mostly to Israel and Ukraine, and lawmakers appear to be at an impasse over the border security measures included in it. It is essential that Congress overcome this opposition and approve it promptly, as an investment in America's security goals.\n\nHere's what this aid package is: a commitment against authoritarianism in Eastern Europe and Asia, as well as a commitment to regional stability in the Middle East. The bill includes $61.4 billion in military and economic assistance for Ukraine and about $14.3 billion in arms assistance to Israel, along with more than $9 billion in humanitarian assistance to both countries and to Gaza. To help win Republican support, the White House added $7.4 billion in security assistance to Taiwan and other Pacific allies -- as well as almost $14 billion to bolster security on the U.S. border with Mexico.\n\nHere's what this aid package is not: a decision to neglect security at home in favor of fighting conflict abroad. A strong and free Ukraine, one that is capable of standing up to Russian aggression, is essential to peace and stability in Europe. If Vladimir Putin's strategy of waiting for American resolve to falter is successful, he would then be in position to attack NATO allies and potentially draw American troops into a war, as President Biden said on Wednesday.\n\nNor is it a turn away from a humane and sensible approach to border security. The compromise that the Biden administration has put forward, and has urged Congress to pass, includes significant funds for additional Border Patrol agents, immigration judges and other border security measures.\n\nSign Up for Newsletters Email* Select Newsletters to Sign Up For News Updates Breaking News Sports Digest Obituaries and Death Notices Submit\n\nOne Democratic aide told NBC News that the party's negotiators have offered proposals to streamline asylum processing and change the \"credible fear\" standard for approving an asylum claim, a measure that immigration advocates oppose. But Republicans have rejected those reasonable compromises and reportedly are pushing for extreme measures that could effectively end asylum altogether and could mean giving the executive branch broad new power to shut down the border.\n\nThis package also should not be seen as a blanket approval of Israel's approach to war in Gaza. There are real concerns about the number of civilian casualties in this conflict so far, and the Biden administration has been appropriately vocal about these concerns. In February, the State Department put strict rules in place to try to reduce the risk of harm to civilians from the use of American weapons. So far, there is no indication that the United States considers either Israel or Ukraine to be in violation of American policy.\n\nPublicly, both Mr. Biden and Secretary of State Antony Blinken have urged Israel to reduce the number of civilian casualties, and administration officials have become more forceful, in public statements and in private conversations with Israeli leaders. The recent humanitarian pause that the United States helped negotiate has saved many lives -- by halting the bombardments, allowing aid to enter Gaza and allowing the release of dozens of hostages held by Hamas.\n\nWith so much at stake, the rancor on display recently by Senate leaders was difficult to watch. It is evidence of the performative nature of lawmaking in the United States right now, one that doesn't seem to benefit anyone except those trying to score political points. Passing this aid package would be a step toward protecting America's interests, as well as toward getting back to governing.\n\n\"If we endure, we will also reign with Him; If we deny Him, He will also deny us ...\"",

The 2024 NDAA is no different.\n\nEpoch Times reports:\n\nThe House on Dec. 14 approved the Fiscal Year 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (FY24 NDAA) in a 310-118 vote, ensuring its passage a day after the Senate adopted the massive appropriations measure in an 87-13 tally.\n\nActivate Your Own Stem Cells & Reverse The Aging Process - Choose \"Select & Save\" OR Join, Brand Partner & Select Silver To Get Wholesale Prices Get your Vitamin B17 & Get 10% Off With Promo Code TIM How To Protect Yourself From 5G, EMF & RF Radiation Protect Your Income & Retirement Assets With Gold & Silver Grab This Bucket Of Heirloom Seeds & Get Free Shipping With Promo Code TIM Here's A Way You Can Stockpile Food For The Future Stockpile Your Ammo & Save $15 On Your First Order Preparing Also Means Detoxifying - Here's One Simple Way To Detoxify\n\nThe NDAA earmarks $841.5 billion for the Department of Defense (DOD) -- nearly $32 billion, or 3 percent, more than the FY23 NDAA -- $32.26 billion for the National Nuclear Security Administration, and $12.1 billion in defense-related allocations for other federal agencies.\n\nBoth chambers adopted their respective defense budgets in July. The NDAA is one of 12 appropriations bills that constitute the federal government's yearly budget. Five have now been adopted for FY24, which began Oct. 1. Parts of the federal government are operating under continuing resolutions.\n\nA Senate-House conference committee reconciled differences in the chamber budgets for two months. On Dec. 6, it produced a 3,093-page draft NDAA, 718-page conference report, and a bucket of parliamentary worms that, ultimately, provided the only intrigue during the must-pass bill's last unpassed days.\n\nThe NDAA includes a 5.2-percent pay raise for service members, $145 billion for research into artificial intelligence and hypersonics, investments in Space Force and many, many things -- $886.3 billion worth.\n\nBelow are 10 takeaways from the slow-walked NDAA's sudden Dec. 13-14 rocket-docket dash through the Senate and House, three months after the federal fiscal year began, and six months after both chambers passed seminal budgets.\n\nCrosshairs on China\n\nThe NDAA includes hundreds of allocations to counter the Chinese Communist Party's (CCP's) growing, aggressive military as the Pentagon's top \"pacing challenge.\"\n\nThe budget boosts Taiwan's and Guam's defense, requests an analysis of a how a 2030 war with China would unfold, tracks defense contractors' investments in China and China's investments in defense contractors, and mandates an adjusted Navy shipbuilding plan that emphasizes platforms geared to thwart China's projected 500-ship navy.\n\nThe NDAA establishes a $500 million Taiwan Foreign Military Financing fund and earmarks $108 million to authorize \"a comprehensive training, advising, and institutional capacity-building program\" for Taiwan's military.\n\nThe budget commits billions to Guam's defense with deployment of a Marine regiment and Iron Dome, David's Sling, and Arrow 3 missile defense systems.\n\nThe NDAA boosts alliances with Japan, South Korea, Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Philippines, Malaysia, Australia, New Zealand, and the UK with $9.1 billion for the Pacific Deterrence Initiative, a 40 percent increase.\n\nFISA Fight\n\nThe NDAA's Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) Section 702 extension was fiercely, but futilely, contested on both chamber's floors.\n\nFISA Section 702 allows intelligence agencies to intercept foreign communications without warrants. It provides a \"back door\" to ferret through Americans' conversations with foreign nationals, conservatives say.\n\nSection 702 expires Dec. 31. House Armed Forces Committee Chair Mike Rogers (R-Ala.) said extending it to mid-April provides time to reform FISA while not handcuffing intelligence agencies.\n\n\"By God, let's reform it,\" Rep. Jim Himes (D-Conn.) said, \"but do not let it expire. If it expires, Americans and allies will die.\"\n\nReps. Chip Roy (R-Texas) and Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) maintained the extension should be separately debated, is not related to defense, and would reauthorize it for 16 months, not four.\n\n\"What we're going to do is pile an extension of FISA on the backs of our men and women in uniform,\" Mr. Roy said.\n\nYoked to Woke\n\nWhen the House adopted its defense budget in July, it included amendments banning the DOD's paid-leave abortion policy, gender-transition treatments and surgeries for service members and their families, and funding for on-base drag shows.\n\nNone are in the NDAA reported out of conference committee Dec. 6, approved by the Senate Dec. 12, and endorsed by the House Dec. 13.\n\nMr. Gaetz said the NDAA was a good bill in July but is now something else. \"You almost feel like a parent who sent a child to summer camp and comes back a monster,\" he said.\n\nWin some, lose some, Mr. Rogers said.\n\nThe NDAA bans critical race theory, bases promotions on merit, requires a special inspector general for Ukraine, mandates \"the DOD to finally pass an audit,\" and provides \"a path back for those discharged over COVID-19 vaccine.\"\n\nDOD Inoculated Against Vaccine Reparations\n\nThe NDAA incorporates most of a House-adopted amendment to reinstate 8,600 service members discharged for refusing the DOD-mandated COVID-19 vaccine.\n\nTo qualify, discharged veterans must be within two years of separation and have requested an exemption.\n\nThe NDAA also requires the DOD to conduct a study evaluating the health effects of the COVID-19 vaccine, establish a board to review the discharges, and track down to query those discharged about reenlisting within the next six months.\n\nThe NDAA \"provides a path back to service for those discharged over COVID-19 vaccine\" without losing rank, Mr. Rogers said.\n\nBut not all the way back, Mr. Gaetz lamented.\n\n\"We were told over and over again there would be back-pay, reparations, and restoration-of-rank for people improperly told they could not express their patriotism through military service because they didn't want to take an experimental vaccine,\" he said, but those provisions are \"totally absent\" in the \"watered-down NDAA.\"\n\nMarines Get Their Amphib\n\nThe NDAA requires the Navy and Air Force to build more ships and aircraft than initially requested, and delays or prohibits planned retirements of several ships and warplane types.\n\nThe Navy's $255.8 billion budget, a 4.5 percent increase, earmarks $32.9 billion to build eight warships: a Columbia-class ballistic submarine, two Virginia-class submarines -- part of a multiyear procurement of 10 attack subs -- two guided-missile destroyers, two guided-missile frigates, and an oiler.\n\nThe NDAA includes a statute mandating the Navy maintain 11 aircraft carriers and 31 amphibious warfare ships with at least 10 being LHA/LHD \"big deck\" ships. The Navy wanted to retire a line of LHA/LHD ships and fall below that 31-amphib fleet requirement. The Marines opposed it.\n\nCongress not only sided with the Marines, but included $1.9 billion to fully fund construction of a San Antonio-class amphibious transport dock ship that the Marine Corps lobbied for and the Navy didn't request.\n\n$600 Million for Ukraine\n\nWhile Ukraine must wait until 2024 to secure $61 billion in aid the Biden administration is seeking in its stymied $106 billion supplemental request, Kyiv will receive at least two years of funding for the next two years under the defense bill.\n\nThe NDAA appropriates $300 million in both FY24 and FY25 -- $600 million -- to the Ukraine Security Assistance Initiative (USAI) fund.\n\nSome House conservatives oppose funding Ukraine's defense, claiming it is embroiling the United States into war with Russia and draining taxpayers already on the hook for the government's $34 trillion debt.\n\nMr. Rogers said Ukraine allocations will be audited by a special inspector general.\n\nMr. Roy called it \"pretty extraordinary\" that the House in July voted to defund USAI \"and, yet, we are authorizing it here. For the life of me, I do not understand why this is how Republicans think we should end the year, heading out for Christmas.\"\n\nPartial UAP Disclosure Act\n\nThe NDAA partially incorporates the proposed UAP Disclosure Act, which calls for an independent board to review and release records related to unidentified aerial phenomena (UAP) collected by federal agencies and shared with commercial entities.\n\nThe board would resemble the one that sifts through JFK assassination-related records under The Collection Act of 1992.\n\n\"We should do the same with UAPs,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-N.Y), who co-sponsored the bill with Sen. Mike Rounds (R-S.D.).\n\nThe NDAA amendment \"for the first time [requires] the national archives to gather records from across the federal government on UAPs [with] a legal mandate to release those records to the public,\" he said.\n\nThe amendment falls short of the bill, Mr. Rounds said. To \"obtain recovered UAP material or biological remains that may have been provided to private entities -- and hidden from Congress and the American people -- we're lacking oversight opportunities,\" he said.\n\nA Major Naval Treaty\n\nThe NDAA ratifies the newly-signed U.S., Australia, and UK (AUKUS) agreement, a trilateral treaty the Pentagon says will foster \"game-changing defense advantages in building, deploying, and jointly operating attack submarines.\"\n\nUnder the pact, Australia will purchase up to five Virginia-class attack submarines, a future generation of submarines will be built in the UK and Australia with U.S. tech support, and submarines for all three will be built and overhauled in Adelaide, Australia.\n\nThe FY24 budget sells three Virginia-class subs -- at least one new -- to Australia in the 2030s before Australian-built submarines enter service in the 2040s.\n\nRep. Andy Kim (D-N.J.) said AUKUS is what the FY24 NDAA \"will be remembered for.\" Rep. Adam Smith (D-Wash.) called it \"crucial in deterring China and strengthening our allies.\"\n\nRep. Joe Courtney (D-Conn.) said such keel-to-combat integration has \"never happened before,\" praising the \"very unique and unprecedented step being taken by the three countries.\"\n\nNATO Notions and Motions\n\nThrough 2023's first six months, hours were spent in House committee hearings debating, at conservatives' prodding, the value of United States' NATO membership, essentially questioning why the 75-year-old alliance exists since without American muscle and American dollars, it wouldn't exist.\n\nWhile the United States dedicates up to 4 percent of its annual GDP to defense, many NATO nations shirk that commitment, they said, noting Germany for decades contributed 1 percent GDP to defense.\n\nMr. Roy's July amendment \"that the U.S. should not continue subsidizing NATO-member countries who choose not to invest in their own defense\" narrowly failed, 2018-2012.\n\nMotions to leave NATO, including Rep. Warren Davidson's (R-Ohio) failed amendment, didn't get far in Congress, but the FY24 NDAA ensures such motions and notions stay in Congress.\n\nAn amendment, co-filed by Sens. Tim Kaine (D-Va.) and Marco Rubio (R-Fla.), prohibits a president from withdrawing from NATO by executive order without congressional approval.\n\nMissile Defense Upgrades\n\nSince October, U.S. Navy destroyers have knocked down drones and ballistic missiles launched from Yemen by Iran-backed Houthi rebels, and U.S. Army anti-missile batteries have repelled more than 100 drone and missile attacks on Marines and soldiers in Syria and Iraq.\n\nThe Pentagon's increasing demands, and Ukraine-Russia and Israel-Hamas wars, have fostered munitions shortfalls and exposed an urgent need for more missile systems, missiles, and missileers to counter proliferating threats \"across all realms.\"\n\nThe FY24 NDAA earmarks more than $70 billion for theater-range, tactical missile defense, primarily the MIM-104 Patriot missile, Terminal High Altitude Area Defense (THAAD) interceptor, and Aegis Ballistic Missile Defense system.\n\nIt includes $30 billion for five new 90-man Patriot units; six THAAD units; and seven newly Aegis-equipped warships, bringing the number to 60.\n\nThe Pentagon says the package will send a $50 billion \"demand signal\" to domestic industry and spur investment in munitions and production lines.\n\nArticle posted with permission from Sons of Liberty Media\n\nTim Brown Tim Brown is a Christian and lover of liberty, a husband to his \"more precious than rubies\" wife, father of 10 \"mighty arrows\" and jack of all trades.

        "body": "RICHARDSON, TX / ACCESSWIRE / December 18, 2023 / Optex Systems Holdings, Inc. (Nasdaq: OPXS), a leading manufacturer of precision optical sighting systems for domestic and worldwide military and commercial applications, announced financial results for the twelve months ended October 1, 2023.\n\nDanny Schoening, CEO of Optex Systems Holdings, Inc., commented, \"This was another strong year for Optex. Our backlog has grown to historic highs and with this, a growing set of new customers bringing multi-year programs further broadening our product mix. Our customers continue to design our products into their latest platforms and reward us for the value that we provide. Supply chain issues continue to improve which increases our own factory efficiencies. As stated last year, 2022 was indeed strong and fulcrum year yielding continued revenue growth, profitability and product mix for 2023. Given the record backlog stated earlier, we anticipate these trends to continue in 2024.\"\n\nFor the twelve months ended October 1, 2023, our total revenues increased by $3.3 million, or 14.6%, compared to the prior year period. The Optex Systems segment realized a $2.6 million, or 27.1% increase, and the Applied Optics Center segment realized an increase of $0.7 million, or 5.4%, in external revenue compared to the prior year period.\n\nGross profit increased $1.7 million, or 17.8%, from $4.9 million in the 2022 fiscal year to $6.6 million in the 2023 fiscal year. Optex Systems gross profit increased by $1.3 million and the Applied Optics Center gross profit increased by $0.4 million. The increase is primarily due to higher revenue combined with higher fixed cost absorption at both the Applied Optics Center and Optex Richardson segments related to increased production volume.\n\nFor the year ended October 1, 2023, we recorded operating income of $2.8 million as compared to operating income of $1.6 million during the year ended October 2, 2022. The $1.2 million, or 69.2% increase in operating income is primarily due to higher revenue and gross profit, partially offset by increased general and administrative expenses.\n\nAs of October 1, 2023, Optex Systems Holdings had working capital of $13.5 million, as compared to $10.0 million as of October 2, 2022. During the twelve months ended October 1, 2023, we used operating cash of ($0.3) million, primarily driven by increased inventory, and spent ($0.4) million on acquisitions of property and equipment.\n\nIn March 2023, we moved our line of credit from PNC Bank to Texas Capital Bank and increased our available line of credit to $3.0 million from the previous $2.0 million line with PNC. The increase in credit limit helps us meet our working capital requirements in light of the increased customer orders and backlog. As supplier issues and labor shortages continue to abate and based on our current backlog, we anticipate an overall increase for fiscal year 2024 revenue and operating cash flow as compared to the 2023 levels.\n\nAt October 1, 2023, the Company had approximately $1.2 million in cash and an outstanding payable balance of $1.0 against its $3.0 million line of credit. As of October 1, 2023, our outstanding accounts receivable balance was $3.6 million, which has been collected during the first quarter of fiscal 2024. During the first quarter of 2024, we paid down our credit facility to zero.\n\nOur key performance measures for the three and twelve months ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022 are summarized below.\n\nDuring the twelve months ended October 1, 2023, the Company booked $34.6 million in new orders, representing a 23.6% increase from the prior year period orders of $28.0 million. The orders for the most recently completed twelve months consist of $23.3 million for our Optex Richardson segment and $11.3 million attributable to the Applied Optics Center segment.\n\nThe Company has seen significant increases in orders for many of its defense products during the fiscal year 2023 inclusive of two new customers for our sighting systems and filter programs. On November 1, 2022, the Company announced it has been awarded a $3.4 million sighting system order to repair and refurbish night vision equipment for the Government of Israel. The order represents a significant increase in our Optex Richardson sighting systems business base for a new customer and includes an additional potential award value with a 100% optional award quantity clause. Deliveries under this contract are expected to begin in the second quarter of fiscal year 2024. Our Optex Richardson periscope orders have increased $6.7 million, or 72.8% over the prior year, including $9.0 million in task delivery awards against our long term IDIQ contracts. On June 30, 2023, we booked a $3.0 million delivery order at our Applied Optics segment for the delivery of laser interface filters against a five-year IDIQ contract. On September 18, 2023, the Company announced it was awarded a five-year Indefinite Delivery Indefinite Quantity (IDIQ) contract from the U.S. Government, for M22 (7 x 50) Binoculars with an estimated value of $2.12 million. As of October 1, 2023, the Applied Optics Center had received task orders valuing $0.5 million against this award.\n\nThe Optex Systems Richardson segment currently has six open US Government IDIQ type military contracts for periscopes and two open IDIQ contracts with another prime contractor for periscopes and unity mirrors with unspent funding which covers base year and option year requirement periods into 2029. We anticipate additional orders throughout the next five years for these ongoing contracts. In addition, the Company has three open bid requests for new multi-year IDIQ contracts pending with the U.S. Government for additional periscopes that are expected to be awarded in the next twelve months.\n\nBacklog as of October 1, 2023 was $41.8 million as compared to a backlog of $32.9 million as of October 2, 2022, representing an increase of 27.1%.\n\nThe table below summarizes our twelve-month operating results for the periods ended October 1, 2023 and October 2, 2022, in terms of both the GAAP net income measure and the non-GAAP Adjusted EBITDA measure. We believe that including both measures allows the reader to better evaluate our overall performance.\n\nAdjusted EBITDA has limitations and should not be considered in isolation or a substitute for performance measures calculated under GAAP. This non-GAAP measure excludes certain cash expenses that we are obligated to make. In addition, other companies in our industry may calculate Adjusted EBITDA differently than we do or may not calculate it at all, which limits the usefulness of Adjusted EBITDA as a comparative measure.\n\nDuring the year ended October 1, 2023, we recorded net income applicable to common shareholders of $2.3 million as compared to net income applicable to common shareholders of $1.3 million during the year ended October 2, 2022. The increase of net income of $1.0 million is primarily attributable to the increase in operating profit, offset by increased interest expense of $0.1 million and increased income tax expense of $0.1 million over the prior year period.\n\nOur Adjusted EBITDA increased by $1.3 million to $3.4 million during the twelve months ended October 1, 2023 as compared to $2.1 million during the twelve months ended October 2, 2022. The increase in EBITDA is primarily driven by increased revenue and operating profit during the current year as compared to the prior year twelve-month period.\n\nHighlights of the Consolidated and Segment Results of Operations have been prepared in accordance with GAAP. These financial highlights do not include all information and disclosures required in the consolidated financial statements and footnotes and should be read in conjunction with our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the twelve months ended October 1, 2023 filed with the SEC on December 18, 2023.\n\nOptex Systems Holdings, Inc.\n\nConsolidated Balance Sheets\n\nThe accompanying notes in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the twelve months ended October 1, 2023 filed with the SEC on December18, 2023 are an integral part of these financial statements.\n\nOptex Systems Holdings, Inc.\n\nConsolidated Statements of Income\n\nThe accompanying notes in our Annual Report on Form 10-K for the twelve months ended October 1, 2023 filed with the SEC on December18, 2023 are an integral part of these financial statements.\n\nABOUT OPTEX SYSTEMS\n\nOptex, which was founded in 1987, is a Richardson, Texas based ISO 9001:2015 certified concern, which manufactures optical sighting systems and assemblies, primarily for Department of Defense (DOD) applications.

        "title": "12 Most Profitable Cheap Stocks To Buy",
        "body": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 most profitable cheap stocks to buy. If you want to skip our coverage of the latest happenings in the renewable energy industry, then you can skip ahead to 5 Most Profitable Cheap Stocks To Buy.\n\nAs investors seek to exit 2023 with the hopes of interest rates coming down, the stock market of today is quite different from the one before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the 2022 mega inflation cycle, and the pre-coronavirus pandemic era. Interest rates in the U.S. now sit at record high levels for the 21st century, and they have naturally impacted the stock market and its valuations.\n\nOne of the most basic ways in which a stock, or even the entire market, is valued is the price to earnings ratio. This ratio measures the premium that investors pay for a firm over its ability to generate bottom line profit, and a higher ratio implies a higher valuation. So when rates are high, investors demand a higher premium for the opportunity cost of parking capital in interest paying securities, and naturally, this leads to depressed demand for stocks that ends up reducing their valuations.\n\nFor the prudent investor, this reduction can also present a buying opportunity if the bets are correctly timed. Lower valuations due to monetary policy are mostly unrelated to a firm's underlying fundamentals. Consequently, there is potential for them to 'self correct' should the economic environment improve to provide investors with an opportunity to book a profit.\n\nThis became quite clear in December 2023 after the latest comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The central bank has raised interest rates to 5.25%, and with the year coming to a close, anything that anyone can talk about is when the rates will start to drop. Well, Mr. Powell's latest statements warned against the perils of keeping rates too high for too long, and as a result, stock markets soared across the board. For the week ending on December 15th, the S&P 500 gained 2.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) soared by 2.9%, and the NASDAQ Composite posted 2.8% in returns as valuations started to adjust due to hopes of lower interest rates.\n\nIn fact, the Fed's decision to keep rates unchanged was quite good for the S&P 500 as the flagship benchmark stock index went on to touch a 23 week high of 4738 points. This came right when billions of dollars poured into equity funds as investors were in no mood to wait and miss out on returns after confidence in a dovish Fed grew. During the week, $2 billion made its way into U.S. equity funds, with technology and high growth stocks leading the charge.\n\nBut what about the economy? After all, while interest rates are naturally quite relevant to stock valuations, so is the economic picture. The stock market is a risky investment vehicle and one that sees funds flow only if the economy is expected to perform to expectations. One of the biggest debates that has stemmed from the Fed's rapid interest rate hikes is whether they carry the potential to tip America into a recession. Should this be the case, then the market will naturally drop, so it's important to understand where the economy will head next year as the interest rate hikes feed their way into the system.\n\nOn this front, data from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is quite relevant. Its latest report estimates that GDP growth in the U.S. will slow down to 1.4% in 2024 after posting 2.5% for the full year 2023. The 2.5% figure for this year is an upward revision from the CBO's previous estimate of 0.9% for a rather sizeable revision. When it comes to inflation, the CBO believes that the personal consumption expenditures (CPE) index will sit at 2.1% in 2024, just 0.1% higher than the Fed's preferred reading of 2% due to better supply chains. Finally, it also estimates that the economy will grow by 2.2% in 2025 - a noticeable gain but a downward revision from an earlier 2.4% nevertheless.\n\nSo, with the market now re calibrating its expectations for the future, we decided to take a look at the most profitable cheap stocks to buy, with the top three picks being First Citizens BancShares, Inc.

        "title": "China Committee Chair Gallagher proposes Taiwan deterrence strategy, demands Pentagon classified briefing - 1010 WCSI",
        "body": "EXCLUSIVE: House China Committee Chairman Mike Gallagher is requesting a classified briefing from the Pentagon to discuss ways the United States can work to aid Taiwan in deterrence efforts amid heightened aggression in the region.\n\nGallagher, R-Wis., penned a letter to Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks, obtained exclusively by Fox News Digital, in which he says the United States needs to build an \"arsenal of deterrence.\"\n\nTOP REPUBLICAN SOUNDS ALARM ON US TERRITORY BEING 'HIGHLY VULNERABLE' TO CHINESE MISSILES\n\n\"In December 1940, while we were still at peace, President Franklin D. Roosevelt famously called on the United States to be the 'great arsenal of democracy,'\" he writes. \"He said it was the 'purpose of the nation' to build 'with all possible speed, every machine, every arsenal, every factory that we need to manufacture our defense material.'\"\n\nGallagher said Roosevelt's call to provide a \"lifeline\" to allies also helped to \"arm our own military in advance of and through the years of heavy conflict and ultimately win the war.\"\n\n\"Today, the United States finds itself needing to rebuild a different kind of arsenal - an arsenal of deterrence,\" he wrote.\n\nGallagher warns that Chinese President Xi Jinping has \"ordered the Chinese military to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027.\"\n\nNow, Gallagher is warning that in order to \"prevent war,\" the United States must \"quickly remake an arsenal of deterrence that can arm Taiwan as well as our own forces to allow us to prevail in any conflict in the Indo-Pacific.\"\n\nGallagher, however, said the United States' current \"struggles\" to meet the significant demand for U.S. munitions in Ukraine, and now even in Israel, have revealed \"the fragility of our munitions industrial base.\"\n\nREPUBLICANS DEMAND ANSWERS AFTER TOP BIDEN OFFICIAL INVITED CCP LEADERS TO SENSITIVE NATIONAL SECURITY SITE\n\nThe committee has engaged in war games simulating a conflict with China over Taiwan, which revealed that the United States \"would run out of long-range, precision-guided munitions in less than one week.\"\n\nGallagher warned that the simulation also revealed that the United States would need to fight closer to Chinese defensive fire, and would increase the risk to air and naval assets - as well as the service members who would operate them.\n\n\"With no guarantees that a war in the Indo-Pacific would be limited to weeks or even months, the possibility that we may have to fight for an extended period without the most effective assets in our arsenal is deeply alarming,\" he writes. \"In addition, significant delays in the deliveries of critical missiles to Taiwan, including anti-ship Harpoon missiles, make it unclear whether Taiwan itself will have sufficient weapons to defend itself and repel a Chinese invasion.\"\n\nGallagher added that \"rearming Taiwan after hostilities have commenced, as we did with Ukraine, would be significantly more difficult, if not infeasible.\"\n\n\"Today's challenges must force us to adapt and think outside the box. If delays are preventing vital weapons from being delivered to Taiwan, we must be creative in putting together capabilities - using weapons and assets already in our inventory - that we can promptly deliver to Taiwan,\" he said.\n\nGallagher said if cost and production times are limiting U.S. supplies, he would propose cheaper alternatives that could, instead, be produced quickly, and would complement the more expensive missiles.\n\nJOINT CHIEFS CHAIRMAN SAYS 'WE ALL SHOULD BE' WORRIED ABOUT CHINA POSSIBLY INVADING TAIWAN\n\n\"Two innovative ideas - the 'MacGyver' Harpoons and Powered JDAMs - may offer potential solutions to our problems and help strengthen the arsenal of deterrence at this urgent moment,\" Gallagher proposed.\n\nThe Harpoon missiles, which Gallagher calls \"inventive,\" have been used in Ukraine's fight against Russia.\n\nGallagher said a \"MacGyver\" solution, which is using existing components and older Harpoon missiles already in our inventory, may help get much-needed weapons to Taiwan at a \"significantly lower cost per round.\"\n\n\"The United States currently has hundreds of Harpoon missiles that are being considered for demilitarization, destruction, or long-term stowage. Taiwan may be able to use these missiles with a land-based launch system with only minor modifications,\" Gallagher proposed.\n\n\"Missile launch support structures and Harpoon Ship Command-Launch Control Systems could be taken off decommissioned Navy ships. Communications systems and data links could come from existing Taiwanese systems. Power generators and ground platforms, such as steel plates or Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Trucks, could come from either American or Taiwanese stocks,\" he explained.\n\nGallagher also pointed to Joint Direct Attack Munitions, or JDAMs, which he said were used extensively by the United States in both Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n\"The 'Powered' JDAM - an innovative concept that would allow a standard 500-pound bomb to travel several hundred miles as a cruise missile - could provide a cheaper, near-term solution to complement the more expensive PGMs that take years to build,\" he said, adding that they may be able to attack targets at both land and sea.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGallagher stressed that \"reviving and rebuilding an arsenal of deterrence will require a generational investment and mobilization.\"\n\n\"At the same time, we must be realistic about how quickly the munitions industrial base will be able to produce our most essential weapons. We must be creative and think outside the box to come up with solutions,\" he said. \"The urgency of the moment requires nothing less.\"\n\nGallagher requested a classified briefing from the Pentagon next month regarding the agency's plans it has to pursue the weapons systems he has proposed.",

        "title": "Winter Commencement 2023 lessons: Embrace Berkeley's values, pursue audacious goals",
        "body": "Some 1,000 students participated in Saturday's event; Nobel laureate Jennifer Doudna was the keynote speaker.\n\nJade Amor-Shannan Johnson and Cerenity Bush stood under the bright winter sun on Saturday, proudly waiting to process into UC Berkeley's Haas Pavilion and wearing personalized caps bedecked in glitter, illustrations and motivating phrases.\n\nJohnson's cap said, \"The marathon continues,\" and Bush's quoted Maya Angelou: \"Success is loving life and daring to live it.\"\n\nThe wording suited the two friends, who were among some 1,000 undergraduate and graduate students participating in Winter Commencement 2023. Approximately 6,000 guests cheered as graduates' names were called.\n\nJohnson had majored in legal studies, with a minor in African American studies. She graduated in three years. Her secret? \"I know how to have fun and show up for my studies. I'm happy I worked hard,\" she said.\n\nBush's major was psychology. As a transfer student from Georgia, she said she'd initially had a hard time finding her place at Berkeley and \"felt a heavier weight in getting used to the university, with much less time.\" But she prevailed.\n\nAnother graduating transfer student, Vanessa Reyes, credited Berkeley for having \"broadened my horizons.\" As a Mexican American, she grew up in a small town and said she had felt \"culture shock coming here.\"\n\nReyes was selected to sing the national anthem at Commencement, but decided to keep it a surprise for the nearly 30 family members there to honor her. \"Graduating from college is a big deal to my family,\" she said. \"I was taught to be proud of who I am and where I grew up. It's an honor to sing this song.\"\n\nYael Hacohen held the hands of her 7- and 3-year old daughters, both wearing tiny graduation robes, when she approached the stage to be hooded for a Ph.D. in rhetoric. A fourth-generation Berkeley graduate and a published poet from Israel, Hacohen said it took a village to get to this day. \"I had the best faculty members, who supported every aspect of my writing, every question,\" she said.\n\nWhen asked about juggling her studies and parenthood, Hacohen said, \"It matters to be a woman, a mother, and to know that it is possible to achieve anything.\"\n\nIn her remarks, Chancellor Carol T. Christ acknowledged that political and ideological divides -- and, most recently, opposing perspectives about the conflict in the Middle East -- are straining the ties that bind the campus community. She encouraged graduates to carry with them Berkeley's values, including freedom of expression and respectful dialogue.\n\n\"I urge you to try to understand views different from your own,\" Christ said. \"Be skeptical of those who would divide the world into simplistic categories of good and evil, black and white -- if only because the reality of our world is often far more complex in its shades of gray.\"\n\nFollowing her address, Christ presented the Elise and Walter A. Haas International Award to Damir Arnaut, who received from Berkeley his undergraduate degree in 1997, his master's in 1998 and his J.D. in 2002. The award annually honors one of Berkeley's alumni with a distinguished record of service to another country. Elected to three terms as a member of Parliament in Bosnia and Herzegovina and recently appointed ambassador to Germany, Arnaut has dedicated his life to strengthening democracy and human rights. He was the first public official to support Bosnia and Herzegovina's first LGBT pride march.\n\nIn his remarks, Arnaut said a Berkeley degree gives graduates both humility and audacity. \"Berkeley teaches you what is right, provides you the skills to bring it about,\" he said, \"but also gives you that healthy dose of arrogance that makes you unwavering in your quest.\"\n\nArnaut is currently working to dismantle ethnic divisions that keep individuals like his son -- who Arnaut said was born into a \"mixed marriage\" (Arnaut is Bosnian, and his wife is Croatian) -- from holding public office. \"I won't quit in this endeavor. I wouldn't be worthy of this school, or this award, if I did,\" he said.\n\nGraduate Pearleen Wang, who double-majored in data science and music, was chosen to speak as the student representative. She told a story about her mother, who grew up in rural southern Taiwan and poured everything she had into providing a better life for her daughters, including nurturing artistic activities she had not experienced herself. One day, however, she decided to learn the art of cake decorating.\n\n\"The more she studied and practiced, the more fantastic her creations became,\" said Wang, describing dreamy flower gardens and scenes painted with edible watercolors. \"She unlocked an incredible artistic side that had lain dormant since childhood. My family showed me that learning is a lifelong journey, and it's never too late to discover something new about yourself.\"\n\nProfessor Jennifer Doudna, 2020 winner of the Nobel Prize in Chemistry for her development of CRISPR-Cas9, a genome-engineering technology, gave the keynote address to several rounds of applause. Just last week, the federal Food and Drug Administration approved the first-ever therapy using this technology for sickle cell disease, a painful, debilitating blood disorder.\n\n\"I'm particularly proud that this therapeutic came from fundamental research here at UC Berkeley,\" Doudna said. But, she said, much work remains to make the treatment more widely and globally available. \"We can do this by forging the right partnerships,\" she said. \"And we need to explain our work and invite discussion and debate.\"\n\nComparing the winter graduates' journey to Homer's The Odyssey, Doudna said, \"Like the world of ancient Greece, the world you are entering is dynamic. Embrace it with open arms and a resolute spirit.\"\n\nShe encouraged students to pursue audacious goals with passion and determination. \"But never lose sight of your values, integrity and empathy,\" she said. \"Success is measured, in large part, by the positive impact you have on others.\"",

        "body": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 most profitable cheap stocks to buy. If you want to skip our coverage of the latest happenings in the renewable energy industry, then you can skip ahead to 5 Most Profitable Cheap Stocks To Buy.\n\nAs investors seek to exit 2023 with the hopes of interest rates coming down, the stock market of today is quite different from the one before the Russian invasion of Ukraine, the 2022 mega inflation cycle, and the pre-coronavirus pandemic era. Interest rates in the U.S. now sit at record high levels for the 21st century, and they have naturally impacted the stock market and its valuations.\n\nOne of the most basic ways in which a stock, or even the entire market, is valued is the price to earnings ratio. This ratio measures the premium that investors pay for a firm over its ability to generate bottom line profit, and a higher ratio implies a higher valuation. So when rates are high, investors demand a higher premium for the opportunity cost of parking capital in interest paying securities, and naturally, this leads to depressed demand for stocks that ends up reducing their valuations.\n\nFor the prudent investor, this reduction can also present a buying opportunity if the bets are correctly timed. Lower valuations due to monetary policy are mostly unrelated to a firm's underlying fundamentals. Consequently, there is potential for them to 'self correct' should the economic environment improve to provide investors with an opportunity to book a profit.\n\nThis became quite clear in December 2023 after the latest comments by Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell. The central bank has raised interest rates to 5.25%, and with the year coming to a close, anything that anyone can talk about is when the rates will start to drop. Well, Mr. Powell's latest statements warned against the perils of keeping rates too high for too long, and as a result, stock markets soared across the board. For the week ending on December 15th, the S&P 500 gained 2.5%, the Dow Jones Industrial Average (DJIA) soared by 2.9%, and the NASDAQ Composite posted 2.8% in returns as valuations started to adjust due to hopes of lower interest rates.\n\nIn fact, the Fed's decision to keep rates unchanged was quite good for the S&P 500 as the flagship benchmark stock index went on to touch a 23 week high of 4738 points. This came right when billions of dollars poured into equity funds as investors were in no mood to wait and miss out on returns after confidence in a dovish Fed grew. During the week, $2 billion made its way into U.S. equity funds, with technology and high growth stocks leading the charge.\n\nBut what about the economy? After all, while interest rates are naturally quite relevant to stock valuations, so is the economic picture. The stock market is a risky investment vehicle and one that sees funds flow only if the economy is expected to perform to expectations. One of the biggest debates that has stemmed from the Fed's rapid interest rate hikes is whether they carry the potential to tip America into a recession. Should this be the case, then the market will naturally drop, so it's important to understand where the economy will head next year as the interest rate hikes feed their way into the system.\n\nOn this front, data from the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is quite relevant. Its latest report estimates that GDP growth in the U.S. will slow down to 1.4% in 2024 after posting 2.5% for the full year 2023. The 2.5% figure for this year is an upward revision from the CBO's previous estimate of 0.9% for a rather sizeable revision. When it comes to inflation, the CBO believes that the personal consumption expenditures (CPE) index will sit at 2.1% in 2024, just 0.1% higher than the Fed's preferred reading of 2% due to better supply chains. Finally, it also estimates that the economy will grow by 2.2% in 2025 - a noticeable gain but a downward revision from an earlier 2.4% nevertheless.\n\nSo, with the market now re calibrating its expectations for the future, we decided to take a look at the most profitable cheap stocks to buy, with the top three picks being First Citizens BancShares, Inc.

        "title": "Qatar-Funded Organization Reportedly Urges Hostages' Families Not To Slam Qatar, Which Hosts Hamas - Conservative Angle",
        "body": "An organization which has been instrumental in securing the release of American hostages from abroad but also gets a great deal of funding from Qatar's government reportedly lectured families of Israeli hostages taken by Hamas not to criticize Qatar, which has financially backed Hamas to the tune of nearly $2 billion since 2007 and also hosts its leaders in Doha.\n\nThe Richardson Center for Global Engagement claims it \"promotes global peace and dialogue by identifying and working on areas of opportunity for engagement and citizen diplomacy with countries and communities not usually open to more formal diplomatic channels,\" as Lahav Harkov reported, noting that the organization repeatedly claimed last year that it \"is greatly appreciative of our partners, including the Government of Qatar, and the many individuals who support and enable our work as a non-for-profit.\"\n\nAs far back as 2019, Harkov pointed out, the Richardson Center revealed a \"substantial investment in hostage recovery\" from Qatar, as its Executive Director Mickey Bergman said \"the funding provided by Qatar will allow us to expand our team, engage in more on the ground activities, and provide even greater support to families in their darkest hours.\"\n\nHarkov stated of the hostages' families, \"We are currently working with many of the families. Our only priority is the safe return of the hostages. Due to the sensitivity of the work, we are not able to comment on any of it.\"\n\nBut a source advising hostages' families told Jewish Insider the Richardson Center told the families that \"pressure on Qatar would be counterproductive because Qatar holds all the leverage.\" The source continued, \"It's all a scam on the families, sadly. The one lever not pulled in 10 weeks is pressure on Qatar.\"\n\nAnother source differed, saying of Bergman, \"It's hard for me to believe that this is in his self-serving interest over funding.\"\n\nSeth Frantzman of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies said, \"While it is imperative that the hostages be released as soon as possible, one should be wary of Doha's role as both a host of Hamas and a mediator. Hamas has benefited from being hosted in Qatar, seeking legitimization the same way the Taliban did via Doha in the past. It is essential that Qatar give Hamas the cold shoulder and condemn the group's atrocities.\"\n\nAsher Fredma of the Misgav Institute for National Security and Zionist Strategy, echoed, \"Qatar's ultimate goal is for Hamas to survive and continue to be an Islamist terrorist force in the region, so definitely calling out Qatar is the right thing to do. Qatar is a negative actor that should be treated as such. The U.S. and Israel and all the actors...putting pressure on Qatar is the way to get them to take a more active role with regards to the hostages.\"",

        "title": "How Sen. Jim Risch and his Idaho ethos became an unlikely leader on foreign policy as global conflicts rage and his party splits - East Idaho News",
        "body": "WASHINGTON (Spokesman-Review) - By his own account, Jim Risch arrived in Congress in 2009 as something of an isolationist, less interested in the United States' role around the world than in the domestic issues on which he had focused in three decades as a local prosecutor, Idaho state senator, lieutenant governor and a brief stint as governor.\n\nBut when his longtime friend Mike Crapo - who was in charge of committee assignments in the Senate - laid out Risch's options, the incoming Republican senator turned down a coveted seat on the Appropriations Committee in favor of the Foreign Relations Committee, whose members guide the country's policies across the globe.\n\nFifteen years later, the 80-year-old Idaho rancher has become one of the most influential voices in U.S. foreign policy and a champion of America's alliances around the world - at a time when his party is pulled between seemingly opposite poles: one that sees an active U.S. role in the world as a moral and existential imperative and another, ascendant since the presidency of President Trump, that shuns international partners in favor of an \"America first\" ethos.\n\nAs the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee and its chairman from 2019 to 2021, Risch has sought to bridge that divide, heeding the concerns of his constituents in deep-red Idaho while advocating support for U.S. allies and international institutions to keep authoritarian states like Russia, China and Iran at bay.\n\n\"Before I got here, I didn't think this way, but our national security really depends not just on us having a big drawbridge which we can pull up,\" Risch said, \"but having partners, having allies that we can rely on to help us when we get in a spot, or vice versa.\"\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 - and Ukraine's unexpectedly successful defense of its territory, backed by the United States and other allies - provided the clearest example of that principle since the end of the Cold War. Yet as a Ukrainian counteroffensive has fallen short of its goals this year, support for U.S. aid to Kyiv has waned among GOP voters and lawmakers.\n\n\"The biggest threat that my constituents feel is not from there; it's from our southern border,\" Risch said, where thousands of migrants cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally each day, according to federal data. About half of those people get deported, while the rest are allowed to stay in the country - often for years - as they await hearings in an asylum process that nearly everyone in Congress agrees is broken.\n\nThose priorities - and the rifts they expose between and within the parties - are encapsulated in a complex legislative package Congress is now negotiating, for which Senate Democratic leaders said Thursday the chamber would delay its holiday recess, even though the GOP-led House has departed. The potential deal would pair aid to Ukraine, Israel and other allies, requested by President Joe Biden, with the most significant changes in U.S. asylum policy in more than three decades, demanded by Republicans.\n\nIn interviews over the course of a month, Risch laid out a worldview that unites those policies under the banner of national security. At a gathering of diplomats, lawmakers and military officials from around the world in November in Halifax, Nova Scotia, he said the war in Ukraine and the Oct. 7 terror attacks in Israel by Hamas have caused democracies and authoritarian states - \"the good guys\" and \"the bad guys,\" respectively - to \"come together tighter.\"\n\n\"And that is going to perpetuate, I think, into the future,\" Risch said. \"So what does that mean for mankind? I view this as a challenge for the rest of the 21st century: How we figure out how to occupy the planet without killing each other.\"\n\nHis current and former colleagues in Congress, the state legislature and the governor's office described a man whose intelligence and blunt, sometimes brash style have earned him respect among members of both parties in Congress and his counterparts from around the world.\n\nCrapo, Idaho's senior senator, said his fellow Republican hasn't fundamentally changed since they met in 1984, when Crapo was elected to the Idaho state Senate. At the time, Risch was the Senate president pro tempore - who presides over the chamber - a position Crapo took on after Risch lost his seat to a Democrat in 1988.\n\nAs the pro tem, Risch gained an undeserved reputation as \"an iron-fisted leader,\" Crapo said, when in reality he was an \"incredibly results-oriented\" pragmatist who worked hard to build support for his priorities.\n\n\"He's a very strong leader,\" Crapo said. \"But he also understands that leading involves getting the support and developing the right ideas and principles that your colleagues will support them. And he was very flexible in doing that, and I don't mean he gave up on his principles at all.\"\n\n\"When you give your word, you've got to keep your word. If the world sees us throw Ukraine under the bus, what would you do if you were Japan or South Korea?\" -- Sen. Jim Risch, referencing the Budapest Memorandum\n\nCrapo said that same work ethic has made Risch a tireless student of international affairs who uses the expertise of his staff to educate and influence other lawmakers.\n\n\"Jim Risch has gotten one of the plum positions in the United States Congress,\" Crapo said. \"It's already one of the most powerful positions in the Senate. He's turned it into one in which he personally has become, I think, probably the leading foreign relations expert in the Congress.\"\n\nSen. Mitt Romney of Utah, a member of the committee whose path from being the 2012 Republican nominee for president to GOP outcast illustrates how far the party has shifted since Trump's rise, said Risch has the respect and attention of even the Senate Republicans who don't agree with him.\n\n\"He has a lot of credibility, particularly with the Republican caucus, and he's able to bring in historical perspective to the Ukraine aid issue,\" Romney said. \"He has spoken numerous times to our caucus as a group and described at some length the implications of not supporting Ukraine, given the commitments we made when they relinquished their nuclear weapons.\"\n\nRisch said that is his go-to argument when explaining his support for Ukraine, whether to a constituent in Idaho or a skeptical colleague in Congress. He asks them if they have heard of the Budapest Memorandum, a 1994 agreement that saw Ukraine give up the nuclear weapons it had inherited from the collapsed Soviet Union in exchange for the promise that the United States and its allies would protect them in the event of an attack.\n\n\"When you give your word, you've got to keep your word,\" Risch said. \"If the world sees us throw Ukraine under the bus, what would you do if you were Japan or South Korea? You'd be saying, 'We've got to have nuclear weapons, because the U.S. isn't going to take care of us.'\"\n\nSen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican, said that matter-of-fact way of communicating is one of Risch's virtues.\n\n\"He says it like it is,\" Rounds said in Halifax. \"If he likes something, he'll tell you he likes it. If you have a good question, he'll tell you it's a good question. And if he thinks it's dumb, he'll tell you it's dumb. I mean, it's a pretty refreshing way to do business.\"\n\nSen. John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, said that candor sets Risch apart from many of his counterparts in a world where cautious, diplomatic language is the norm. Barrasso recalled a meeting at a previous year's Halifax International Security Form, when he said Risch told a German ambassador during a meeting over a pipeline that would have carried gas from Russia to Germany, \"It's really hard to see you holding hands under the table with the Russian bear.\"\n\n\"People know where they stand when he talks to them, because he's talking like a guy from Idaho,\" Barrasso said. \"I mean, this guy is Idaho through and through.\"\n\nHistorically, though, not every guy from Idaho has taken the same approach to foreign policy. Three senators from the Gem State have chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a number unmatched by any other state since Idaho was admitted to the Union in 1890.\n\nSen. William Borah, a progressive Republican who chaired the committee from 1924 to 1933, was an outspoken isolationist who, as leader of the so-called \"Irreconcilables,\" blocked the ratification of the Treaty of Versailles, preventing the United States from joining the League of Nations after World War I.\n\n\"Back in those days, it was a lot easier to be that,\" Risch said. \"We had two oceans that separated us. We didn't have the communications or the travel or anything else. This world now is so small.\"\n\nSen. Frank Church, a Democrat who chaired the panel from 1979 to 1981, made a name for himself by reining in the government's involvement overseas, authoring the legislation that effectively ended the Vietnam War and then leading an investigation of abuses by U.S. intelligence agencies. Standing in his office and brandishing a recently published book about Church, \"The Last Honest Man,\" Barrasso took issue with the title.\n\n\"Jim Risch is the honest man,\" the Wyomingite said of his friend. \"Church went Washington. Jim Risch stayed Idaho.\"\n\nIn contrast to Church, who embraced life in the nation's capital, Risch flies home nearly every weekend, a long commute made slightly easier by the fact that his ranch is near the airport in Boise. Risch likes to point out that of the three Idahoans who have led the panel, he's the only one who hasn't run for president.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who has worked with Risch on the Foreign Relations and Intelligence panels, said the Idahoan keeps a lower profile than many previous Foreign Relations leaders - including Biden - who used the position as a springboard for higher political aspirations.\n\n\"For most Americans, he'll probably be the best senator and the most impactful senator you may not have heard of,\" Rubio said. \"I think he likes his job and he enjoys the work he does here, but I don't think he's one of these people that's, like, obsessed with politics or defines his life by what happens to his career in the U.S. Senate.\"\n\nEven so, Risch appears destined to play a prominent role in foreign policy before his third term ends at the close of 2026. When he took the gavel as committee chairman in 2019, in the second half of Trump's presidency, he kept a lower profile than his Republican predecessor, Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, who openly criticized Trump's foreign policy decisions.\n\nWhen Democrats took control of the Senate in 2022, Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey took over as chairman, but Menendez was indicted on federal corruption and bribery charges in September and October, leading many of his fellow Democrats to call for his resignation. Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, who had already announced his retirement at the end of 2023, took over as interim chairman.\n\nRisch has avoided directly criticizing Menendez while speaking highly of both Cardin and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, who co-led the U.S. delegation to Halifax in November and will be the top Democrat on the committee if Menendez steps down or is defeated in a re-election bid. Depending on the outcome of the 2024 election, either she or Risch will be in line to lead the panel.\n\nShaheen, whose mother is from Yakima, said she has a \"very positive\" working relationship with Risch, in part because they were both governors before coming to Congress. Although neither she nor Risch are leading negotiations on the national security bill, Shaheen said she was hopeful the two parties could reach a compromise.\n\n\"My experience is that negotiations usually fail when one side or the other overreaches,\" Shaheen said Tuesday. Her question for Republicans, she added, is that if the deal falls apart, \"Are you willing to let Ukraine fail?\"\n\nIn an interview later that day, Risch rejected that question, insisting that border policy reforms can and must be part of the national security package. He emphasized that fewer than 10 of the Senate's 100 members oppose additional aid for Ukraine, while conceding that even a similar share of resistance in the House - where Republicans hold a slim majority - could keep a compromise bill from becoming law.\n\nA Gallup survey released in November found growing opposition to Ukraine aid among U.S. voters, with 62% of Republicans saying the United States is doing \"too much\" to help Kyiv. Florian Justwan, an associate professor of political science at the University of Idaho who studies attitudes towards international conflict, said there is no reliable polling on Idahoans' support for Ukraine.\n\nRep. Russ Fulcher, a Republican who represents North Idaho and areas west of Boise, said his constituents overwhelmingly oppose sending more of their tax dollars to Ukraine's war effort. But the House lawmaker said he would sit down with Risch to \"compare notes\" before taking a vote on a potential aid package.\n\n\"We both speak Idahoan, and what that means to me is I can trust what he's got to say, because I know his base thought process, which is very similar to mine,\" Fulcher said. \"We probably are different on (Ukraine aid), but I very much respect where he's coming from, and I intend on seeking his counsel before making the next major decision here.\"\n\nSen. Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat who praised Risch's foreign policy work while acknowledging their differences on many other issues, said she didn't expect the Idaho senator to play an active role in convincing GOP holdouts to back Ukraine.\n\n\"I don't think that's his style,\" Cantwell said. \"His style is to put out the right value message.\"\n\nSen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, a vocal GOP skeptic of further aid to Kyiv who has argued that Ukraine should cede territory to Russia to end the war, said he respects Risch's right to listen to Idahoans and still come to a different conclusion.\n\n\"The only way for the republican form of government to actually work is if people take input from their constituents, they listen to them, but they have to ultimately make their own decision,\" Vance said.\n\n\"In the many conversations we've had about Ukraine, I've never said, 'You should agree with me because my view is now popular. In the same way, I would have been insulted if he would have told me 18 months ago, 'You have to agree with me because my view is popular.' So I think that he's doing this the right way, even though I think he's wrong on the substance.\"\n\nSen. Chris Coons - a Delaware Democrat who made the trip to Halifax and called Risch \"hardworking, well-informed, tireless and responsive\" - said Risch had recently told him about the opposition to funding humanitarian aid that the Idaho senator was hearing from constituents.\n\n\"It was delivered under the rubric of 'Don't shoot the messenger, but you need to realize that if folks in my state are saying this, they're saying this in half the country,'\" Coons said.\n\nDuring a visit to D.C. where he met with all 100 senators on Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivered the defiant message that \"Ukraine can win.\"\n\nThree days earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin, holding a glass of champagne at an awards ceremony at the Kremlin, said Ukraine had \"no future\" because it relies on waning support from the United States and other allies. On Dec. 15, the government of Hungary's Russia-friendly Prime Minister Viktor Orban blocked $52 billion in aid to Ukraine from the European Union.\n\nJim Jones, a former chief justice of the Idaho Supreme Court, said the state GOP is heading in an extremist direction, driven by recent arrivals who have fled blue states in search of \"the white nationalist nirvana\" in Idaho.\n\nJones said he credits Risch - with whom he sometimes clashed when Risch was Senate pro tem and Jones was Idaho's attorney general in the 1980s - with supporting Ukraine despite opposition in the state.\n\n\"The really radical right-wingers, strangely enough, those people used to be the anti-communists that wanted to take Russia on,\" Jones said. \"Now, they've kind of softened. I think they like the authoritarian attitudes, the anti-gay, pro-state-church attitude that Orban and Putin and those knuckleheads espouse, and they don't see Russia as the same threat that traditional Republicans do. So there's a split in the party.\"\n\nCardin linked anti-Ukraine and pro-Russia sentiments to U.S. opposition to getting involved in the beginning of World War II, when Nazi German propaganda efforts stoked isolationist attitudes among Americans with the aim of keeping the United States neutral.\n\n\"This is an issue that may not be popular,\" he said. \"I wasn't living in the 1930s and so I can't tell you how the feeling was in this country, but I know that when a war is far away from you, you don't think about the impact it has on us. But Ukraine is the front line of democracy.\"\n\nThat idea was echoed by Oleksandra Matviichuk, a Ukrainian human rights lawyer whose organization shared the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\"We can see Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea are building an authoritarian coalition, so people fighting for freedom definitely should support each other,\" she wrote in an email. \"As long as Ukraine remains vulnerable, the entire Euro-Atlantic security system remains vulnerable.\"\n\nAt this pivotal moment for the global order - not just in Ukraine, but in the Middle East, the Indo-Pacific and beyond - Risch finds himself in a position he never imagined before he got to Congress in 2009, at an age when many Americans retire.\n\nJohn Sandy, who met Risch when both were students at the University of Idaho and went on to serve as his chief of staff in the governor's office and the Senate until 2019, said the senator's seemingly boundless energy helped him overcome the late start. Recalling the conversation they had when Risch got elected, Sandy said, \"You have to be very, very thoughtful and don't dive off in the deep end until you're doggone sure you can swim.\"\n\n\"He said, 'I want you to be my chief of staff,' and I literally looked at him and said, 'I don't think that's a very good idea,'\" Sandy recalled. \"And he said, 'Why?' And I said, 'Well, I don't know anything about that.' And he looked at me and he said, 'John, I don't know anything about being a U.S. senator either. It won't take us long. We'll figure this thing out.'\"\n\nReflecting on his career path in Halifax, Risch acknowledged it was \"not a natural tendency for people from Idaho.\"\n\n\"But look, here I am,\" he said. \"And Idahoans have as much equity in the national security of the United States of America as do people from California, New York, Texas and Florida.\"\n\nLater, in his D.C. office, he showed no signs of slowing down.\n\n\"The national security of the United States,\" he said, \"is like the laundry. This is never done.\"",

        "title": "Qatar-Funded Organization Reportedly Urges Hostages' Families Not To Slam Qatar, Which Hosts Hamas",
        "body": "An organization which has been instrumental in securing the release of American hostages from abroad but also gets a great deal of funding from Qatar's government reportedly lectured families of Israeli hostages taken by Hamas not to criticize Qatar, which has financially backed Hamas to the tune of nearly $2 billion since 2007 and also hosts its leaders in Doha.\n\nThe Richardson Center for Global Engagement claims it \"promotes global peace and dialogue by identifying and working on areas of opportunity for engagement and citizen diplomacy with countries and communities not usually open to more formal diplomatic channels,\" as Lahav Harkov reported, noting that the organization repeatedly claimed last year that it \"is greatly appreciative of our partners, including the Government of Qatar, and the many individuals who support and enable our work as a non-for-profit.\"\n\nAs far back as 2019, Harkov pointed out, the Richardson Center revealed a \"substantial investment in hostage recovery\" from Qatar, as its Executive Director Mickey Bergman said \"the funding provided by Qatar will allow us to expand our team, engage in more on the ground activities, and provide even greater support to families in their darkest hours.\"\n\nHarkov stated of the hostages' families, \"We are currently working with many of the families. Our only priority is the safe return of the hostages. Due to the sensitivity of the work, we are not able to comment on any of it.\"\n\nBut a source advising hostages' families told Jewish Insider the Richardson Center told the families that \"pressure on Qatar would be counterproductive because Qatar holds all the leverage.\" The source continued, \"It's all a scam on the families, sadly. The one lever not pulled in 10 weeks is pressure on Qatar.\"\n\nAnother source differed, saying of Bergman, \"It's hard for me to believe that this is in his self-serving interest over funding.\"\n\nSeth Frantzman of the Foundation for the Defense of Democracies said, \"While it is imperative that the hostages be released as soon as possible, one should be wary of Doha's role as both a host of Hamas and a mediator. Hamas has benefited from being hosted in Qatar, seeking legitimization the same way the Taliban did via Doha in the past. It is essential that Qatar give Hamas the cold shoulder and condemn the group's atrocities.\"\n\nAsher Fredma of the Misgav Institute for National Security and Zionist Strategy, echoed, \"Qatar's ultimate goal is for Hamas to survive and continue to be an Islamist terrorist force in the region, so definitely calling out Qatar is the right thing to do. Qatar is a negative actor that should be treated as such. The U.S. and Israel and all the actors...putting pressure on Qatar is the way to get them to take a more active role with regards to the hostages.\"",

        "title": "Meet the 98-year-old man on drums at the WH Hanukkah party",
        "body": "Before the White House Hanukkah party, five Holocaust survivors met with President Joe Biden in the Oval Office, one of whom, 98-year-old Saul Dreier, asked if he could bless him. Biden bowed his head and received Dreier's blessing for a prosperous life.\n\nThen the president asked Dreier if he had any other requests. Yes, Dreier, told him: He wanted to play the drums at the Hannukah party.\n\nBiden then instructed the Secret Service to escort Dreier to the affair, where the Floridian joined the United States Marine Band and played a spirited rendition of \"Hava Nagila\" for more than 800 guests.\n\nA video of Dreier playing the drums with what's commonly called \"The President's Own Marine Band,\" went viral on X, the platform formerly known as Twitter.\n\n\"He is flying high,\" Annie Pearl, a friend who assists Dreier who is also from Tamarac, Florida.\n\nPearl helped Dreier get the invitation to the party, she said in an interview. A week after what's widely considered the most exclusive annual Jewish celebration in the U.S., Dreier is still talking about his Oval Office meet-up and jam with the band.\n\nShelley Greenspan, the White House Jewish liaison who manages the guest list for the party, said Dreier's meeting with Biden and performance hadn't been planned, but reflects the respect the president holds for survivors. He's \"a lifelong believer in commemorating the Holocaust and also acting on the lessons of the Holocaust.\" Greenspan said. \"So just to see this come to fruition was really, really meaningful.\"\n\nDreier, who was born in Poland and survived several concentration camps before arriving in the U.S. in 1949, first started drumming in 2014 after reading an article about a woman pianist who survived the Holocaust and passed away at age 108. To his wife's initial shock, he went out, bought himself a drum set, and founded the Holocaust Survivor Band, which started with a free klezmer concert at a local synagogue and was soon but was soon performing around the country and the world, including in Israel, Germany, Brazil and Poland -- both in Warsaw and at Auschwitz.\n\nHis dream, though, was to play for the president, Pearl said. So she reached out to several members of Congress. Rep. Jared Moskowitz, a freshman Democrat from the Miami area, wrote a letter to the White House, signed by 18 other members -- asking that it invite Dreier to the Hanukkah party list and allow him to play drums there.\n\nGreenspan, whose grandparents survived the Holocaust, said she put Dreier and four survivors who volunteer at the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum on the guest list, but didn't invite him to play because she didn't have the authority.\n\nBut she said she's not surprised Biden made it happen, given his commitment to remembering the Holocaust. In remarks to Jewish audiences, the president often speaks about his visit to Auschwitz with his grandchildren in 2015. And 10 years ago, as vice president in the Obama administration, Biden launched the White House Holocaust Survivor Initiative, a program that and has helped more than 40,000 Holocaust survivors access meals, healthcare and transportation.\n\nDuring his visit to Yad Vashem in Jerusalem in 2022, Biden knelt to speak with two Holocaust survivors, holding their hands and kissing both on their cheeks.\n\nAnd earlier that year, Biden held a 90-minute Oval Office meeting with Holocaust Survivor Bronia Brandman and invited her to light one of the candles of the White House menorah.\n\nThis year, Greenspan and four other White House staffers who descend from Holocaust survivors lit candles at the ceremony.\n\nFollowing the Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, some 2,500 Holocaust survivors and their descendants sent a letter to Biden thanking him for his strong support of Israel\n\nGreenspan said that when she has briefed the president in the Oval Office, he often asked her personal questions about her grandparents who survived the Holocaust. \"It really is something that he cares so deeply about,\" she said. \"This is a culmination of decades of him talking about these issues and being there for people who didn't have a voice for a while.\"",

        "title": "Bridging the Nutritional Gap With Calcium and Magnesium in Dairy Alternatives",
        "body": "A growing number of consumers are turning to dairy alternative products, and this is creating outstanding opportunities to fortify plant-based milk and foods with key minerals, observed Michael Paikin, chief technologist of Israel-based Gadot Biochemical Industries.\n\nFor example, in Europe, between April 2022 and March 2023, there were 27 new oat-based ice cream launches, compared to only eight between April 2019 and March 2020. In America, oat-based dairy alternatives are also experiencing increased launch velocity, 34 and 17, respectively. While launches of almond and pea-protein products are also strong, they are not as robust. Plant-based milks and foods offer consumers the taste and feel of cow's milk, are sustainable, and are also more environmentally friendly by releasing less methane into the atmosphere. However, these popular plant-based products provide less calcium than bovine dairy.\n\n\"The rapidly increasing consumer awareness and demand for nutritionally enriched dairy alternatives creates a focus on nutrition content, notably minerals such as calcium and magnesium,\" observed Paikin. While calcium is the primary mineral added to dairy and plant-based products, magnesium is a crucial element that should be included as well, according to Paikin.\n\nTo summarize, calcium contributes to bone health by forming microscopic crystals that fill in the collagen framework of bone tissue, increasing strength and density. It is also important in regulating muscle contraction and blood clotting. Magnesium is essential in preventing calcification in arteries and veins, which can occur when high amounts of calcium are consumed regularly through both diet and supplementation.\n\nMarket differentiation of plant-based products can be differentiated among the crowding market and serve consumer needs of obtaining multiple nutrients in a convenient and pleasurably tasting product. \"By adding calcium-complementary nutrients such as vitamin D and magnesium, a brand's plant-based product will have a stronger appeal than counterparts that only contain calcium,\" Paikin emphasized.\n\n\"However, it's not as simple as just adding minerals into the plant-based formula for processing into the final product,\" Paikin cautioned. There are three prominent challenges present:\n\n\"Addressing these challenges requires a multi-disciplinary approach involving food scientists, nutritionists, and technologists to create a vegan milk product that is nutritious, palatable, stable, and economically viable,\" Paikin noted.\n\nAs a leader in the mineral fortification category, Gadot offers mineral solutions for calcium and magnesium fortification. These solutions provide a stable suspension with no sedimentation in milk and milk alternatives with no need for additional stabilizers, according to Paikin.\n\nGadot is approaching its 60th anniversary, delivering highly bioavailable ingredients, including tailor-made solutions, soluble minerals, and ingredient-base blends. Gadot´s portfolio includes an array of ingredients, including magnesium, calcium, zinc, potassium, and sodium in different forms, such as citrates, gluconates, and bisglycinates, and continues to expand its offerings based on market demand.",

The cause is personal to Longoria, whose older sister Liza was born with an intellectual disability. In 2012, Longoria also established the Eva Longoria Foundation to help advocate for Latino women through education and entrepreneurship.\n\n\"I'm so honored to be recognized as the recipient of this year's Morton E. Ruderman Award. My older sister Liza was born with an intellectual disability, so my mom instilled in all of us early on the importance of giving back to our community, which is why I founded Eva's Hereos to provide a platform to advocate for the rights of people with disabilities around the country,\" said Longoria.\n\nThe foundation's Morton E. Ruderman Award is in its 10th year. The foundation promotes inclusion at all levels of society and advocates on behalf of other social justice issues. Jay Ruderman, president of the Ruderman Family Foundation, said the award was established to honor the legacy of his father, a staunch supporter of rights for the disabled, who died in 2011.\n\n\"We look for people who are influential in society in terms of advocating for inclusion for people with disabilities,\" Jay Ruderman told Variety. \"Eva certainly has done that with all the work she's done and her personal experience with her sister.\"\n\nPutting the spotlight on a celebrity who works on behalf of disabled communities is key to raising broader awareness of the access and resource issues that remain for those who have special physical and mental needs.\n\n\"We're trying to raise the idea in society in general about the importance of inclusion,\" Ruderman said. \"One way to do that is to give an award to someone who has taken their time and resources to do something positive in the world to promote inclusion.\"\n\nPast recipients include Olympian Michael Phelps, actors Taraji P. Henson and Marlee Matlin, filmmakers Peter and Bobby Farrelly and former U.S. Senator Tom Harkin.\n\nLongoria is a multihyphenate who made her directorial debut earlier this year with the feature \"Flamin' Hot.\" In October, she joined forces with Banijay executive Cris Abrego to launch Hyphenate Media.\n\nThe Ruderman Family Foundation distributes more than $10 million a year to various causes in the U.S. and Israel.",

        "title": "Egypt election results: No surprises as El-Sisi wins 3rd term with Israel-Hamas war raging on border",
        "body": "Cairo -- President Abdel-Fattah El-Sisi was announced Monday as the winner of Egypt's presidential election, with the nation's election authority saying the incumbent had won 89.6% of the votes. The National Election Authority said an \"unprecedented\" 66.8% percent of Egypt's 67 million eligible voters had come to the polls. In the last election, in 2018, which drew a turnout of about 41%, El-Sisi won 97% of the vote.\n\nIt was an all but preordained outcome, as none of the three opposition candidates ever really stood a chance.\n\nThe results, granting former military commander El-Sisi a third term in office, came as no surprise given the absence of strong candidates to challenge the man who's ruled Egypt for about a decade. And opposition figures believe there was more to El-Sisi's overwhelming win than just popularity.\n\n\"The rules of open and free elections do not apply to what happened in Egypt last week,\" according to Dr. Mustapha Kamel Al-Sayyid, a professor of political science at Cairo University who's also a cofounder of the Civil Democratic Movement, a coalition of Egyptian opposition parties.\n\n\"The election was not really competitive,\" said Al-Sayyid, adding that the three other candidates \"did not have the same resources he [El-Sisi] has. He had the machinery of the state completely behind him. In one way or another, he also had the support of major business groups in the country.\"\n\nIn a 2022 report, the U.S. State Department said that ahead of the 2018 election, \"observers noted restrictions on freedom of peaceful assembly, political association, and expression\" which had \"significantly inhibited the political climate surrounding the elections.\"\n\nThe report said local rights groups and even an Egyptian government commission had \"credible reports\" of a litany of human rights abuses, including \"unlawful or arbitrary killings, including extrajudicial killings by the government or its agents, and by terrorist groups; enforced disappearance by state security; torture and cases of cruel, inhuman, or degrading treatment or punishment by the government.\"\n\nWith the war still raging on Egypt's northeast border between Israel and Hamas, however, there were other factors that likely contributed to El-Sisi's sweeping victory.\n\nMonths ago, interest in the upcoming election was slowly increasing among Egyptians. Even the weak, scattered political opposition groups in the country thought there might be a chance to force, through the ballot box, some change from a government that has long been accused of muting dissent.\n\nBut then the Palestinian militant group Hamas launched its unprecedented surprise attack on southern Israel, sparking a war with the potential to spill over the Gaza Strip's borders and become a wider regional conflict.\n\nThe attention of the world, including Egyptians, shifted to Gaza.\n\nAl-Sayyid said some people likely voted for El-Sisi as \"they thought the country is facing a dangerous situation, and in this situation, it is good to have someone who has the support of the military and the experience of running the country.\"\n\nAccording to Egypt's constitution, this should be El-Sisi's last term. But the constitution previously limited presidents to two terms. It was tweaked, by way of amendments, to allow him to run for his third re-election.\n\nAl-Sayyid said he didn't want to speculate, but the possibility of new amendments to Egypt's constitution that could, theoretically, allow El-Sisi to seek yet another term, could not be excluded.\n\n\"Maybe in four or five years. I think some people would say it's for the country to remain stable,\" he said.\n\nAl-Sayyid added that it would be very difficult for any party to field a real challenger to El-Sisi, even by the next election in 2030, unless things change in the country.\n\n\"If restrictions on political parties continue, then there will be no chance for the opposition,\" he said.\n\nEgypt has been struggling through an unprecedented economic crisis, with inflation at painful levels heaping pressure on the daily lives of Egyptians whose salaries have not kept pace with price hikes.\n\nThe government has blamed the economic malaise on the coronavirus pandemic, the war in Ukraine, and now the war in neighboring Gaza, with officials insisting those circumstances are out of its control.\n\nCritics, on the other hand, accuse the government of ballooning the national debt -- including taking by taking out international loans to fund mega-infrastructure projects with no real potential for financial return.\n\n\"The major challenge for El-Sisi,\" Al-Sayyid said, \"is how to deal with this very serious economic situation.\"\n\n\"There are other challenges, but I think this is the most difficult one, because if the economic situation continues to deteriorate, this might lead to popular discontent, and this could be quite destabilizing for the Egyptian political system.\"",

        "body": "SNOWBIRDS AND RELOCATERS VA HEALTH CARE\n\nVA has a special process to help veterans who are \"snow birding\" or relocating this year meet their VA health care needs with the minimum of disruption. Veterans enrolled in VA health care can receive the same standard of care while traveling as they would at home, with the proper planning. VA care coordination for traveling/relocating veterans can be accomplished by contacting the VA traveling/relocating veteran coordinator. All VA medical centers have this coordinator position to help veterans while traveling. The Danville VA medical center (Illiana VA) has the coordinator position for Central Illinois. Traveling or relocating veterans should contact their local VA patient aligned care team (PACT) or specialty care provider/team of the travel destination, temporary address, dates of travel and contact phone number. The veteran should also provide any specific health care questions. This consult helps register you at the new VA location and provides a handoff to your new facility. Traveling veteran coordinators at both sites will work to ensure your care needs are ordered locally and scheduling occurs timely. The Danville contact number is 1-800-320-8387. When the call is answered, push 0. Then tell the operator at Danville that you wish to speak to the traveling/relocating veteran coordinator for VA health care.\n\nVA HEALTH CARE INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY\n\nThe VA has an Office of Healthcare Innovation and Learning that uses the latest technology to manufacture devices that improve diagnostic capabilities and treatment procedures. VA use of the 3D printer has produced another way to view cancer in the kidney before surgery or treatment, thus pinpointing the exact location, size and shape of the cancer. VA can use the 3D printing scanner to take layered pictures of the tumor and can \"print\" a 3D replica of the kidney. The surgeon can then more accurately guide surgical procedures to match the cancerous tumor and allow the surgeon to plan and execute the surgery in the most efficient and effective manner possible. Not only is the surgery done more efficiently and effectively, but the cost is greatly reduced when using the 3D printer for pre-surgery planning. For instance, The VA estimates that the operating room costs about $80 per minute. Using the 3D model to map out the complicated surgery could save two hours of time or $9,600 -- with a model that cost less than $1,000 to produce. It also means less fatigue for the surgeon and less time under anesthesia for the patient. Visit innovation.va.gov/oam/home.html for a more detailed explanation of both the example given as well as other VA innovations.\n\nVeterans Corner: Foreclosure assistance, wreath ceremony, and veteran suicide\n\nListen now and subscribe: Apple Podcasts | Google Podcasts | Spotify | RSS Feed | Omny Studio\n\nARMY-NAVY UNITY AN EXAMPLE FOR AMERICA\n\nThe 2023 annual Army-Navy football game is \"in the books\"! In these times when America is being divided by media, academia, government, religious zealots and a myriad of other factions, the Army-Navy game stands out. There is no greater rivalry than between the military academies! The contest is always hard fought, with team success (not individual accomplishments) the ultimate glory. However, once the game is over, unity takes over. The winning team (this year it is Army) walks to the side of the losing team and together sing that academy's alma mater. Next, they trudge across the field to the victor's side to do the same thing! Then and only then will one side celebrate and the other go off to seek solace in their defeat. If only the politicos, academics, media, religious leaders, and the other groups that have divided America into self-serving niches could set aside their petty differences. America is still the greatest country in the world (maybe in history). It will only prevail if the unified strength of and respect for each of us work toward the common goal of that continued greatness.\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\nMilitary recruiting has become a topic of great concern as we look across the world filled with hotspots like China/Taiwan, Israel/Hamas, Ukraine/Russia, and others still under the radar of the news media. A duty that all Americas should embrace is service to and for our country.\n\n\"Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.\" -- John F.

        "title": "China Committee Chair Gallagher proposes Taiwan deterrence strategy, demands Pentagon classified briefing - WFIN Local News",
        "body": "EXCLUSIVE: House China Committee Chairman Mike Gallagher is requesting a classified briefing from the Pentagon to discuss ways the United States can work to aid Taiwan in deterrence efforts amid heightened aggression in the region.\n\nGallagher, R-Wis., penned a letter to Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks, obtained exclusively by Fox News Digital, in which he says the United States needs to build an \"arsenal of deterrence.\"\n\nTOP REPUBLICAN SOUNDS ALARM ON US TERRITORY BEING 'HIGHLY VULNERABLE' TO CHINESE MISSILES\n\n\"In December 1940, while we were still at peace, President Franklin D. Roosevelt famously called on the United States to be the 'great arsenal of democracy,'\" he writes. \"He said it was the 'purpose of the nation' to build 'with all possible speed, every machine, every arsenal, every factory that we need to manufacture our defense material.'\"\n\nGallagher said Roosevelt's call to provide a \"lifeline\" to allies also helped to \"arm our own military in advance of and through the years of heavy conflict and ultimately win the war.\"\n\n\"Today, the United States finds itself needing to rebuild a different kind of arsenal - an arsenal of deterrence,\" he wrote.\n\nGallagher warns that Chinese President Xi Jinping has \"ordered the Chinese military to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027.\"\n\nNow, Gallagher is warning that in order to \"prevent war,\" the United States must \"quickly remake an arsenal of deterrence that can arm Taiwan as well as our own forces to allow us to prevail in any conflict in the Indo-Pacific.\"\n\nGallagher, however, said the United States' current \"struggles\" to meet the significant demand for U.S. munitions in Ukraine, and now even in Israel, have revealed \"the fragility of our munitions industrial base.\"\n\nREPUBLICANS DEMAND ANSWERS AFTER TOP BIDEN OFFICIAL INVITED CCP LEADERS TO SENSITIVE NATIONAL SECURITY SITE\n\nThe committee has engaged in war games simulating a conflict with China over Taiwan, which revealed that the United States \"would run out of long-range, precision-guided munitions in less than one week.\"\n\nGallagher warned that the simulation also revealed that the United States would need to fight closer to Chinese defensive fire, and would increase the risk to air and naval assets - as well as the service members who would operate them.\n\n\"With no guarantees that a war in the Indo-Pacific would be limited to weeks or even months, the possibility that we may have to fight for an extended period without the most effective assets in our arsenal is deeply alarming,\" he writes. \"In addition, significant delays in the deliveries of critical missiles to Taiwan, including anti-ship Harpoon missiles, make it unclear whether Taiwan itself will have sufficient weapons to defend itself and repel a Chinese invasion.\"\n\nGallagher added that \"rearming Taiwan after hostilities have commenced, as we did with Ukraine, would be significantly more difficult, if not infeasible.\"\n\n\"Today's challenges must force us to adapt and think outside the box. If delays are preventing vital weapons from being delivered to Taiwan, we must be creative in putting together capabilities - using weapons and assets already in our inventory - that we can promptly deliver to Taiwan,\" he said.\n\nGallagher said if cost and production times are limiting U.S. supplies, he would propose cheaper alternatives that could, instead, be produced quickly, and would complement the more expensive missiles.\n\nJOINT CHIEFS CHAIRMAN SAYS 'WE ALL SHOULD BE' WORRIED ABOUT CHINA POSSIBLY INVADING TAIWAN\n\n\"Two innovative ideas - the 'MacGyver' Harpoons and Powered JDAMs - may offer potential solutions to our problems and help strengthen the arsenal of deterrence at this urgent moment,\" Gallagher proposed.\n\nThe Harpoon missiles, which Gallagher calls \"inventive,\" have been used in Ukraine's fight against Russia.\n\nGallagher said a \"MacGyver\" solution, which is using existing components and older Harpoon missiles already in our inventory, may help get much-needed weapons to Taiwan at a \"significantly lower cost per round.\"\n\n\"The United States currently has hundreds of Harpoon missiles that are being considered for demilitarization, destruction, or long-term stowage. Taiwan may be able to use these missiles with a land-based launch system with only minor modifications,\" Gallagher proposed.\n\n\"Missile launch support structures and Harpoon Ship Command-Launch Control Systems could be taken off decommissioned Navy ships. Communications systems and data links could come from existing Taiwanese systems. Power generators and ground platforms, such as steel plates or Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Trucks, could come from either American or Taiwanese stocks,\" he explained.\n\nGallagher also pointed to Joint Direct Attack Munitions, or JDAMs, which he said were used extensively by the United States in both Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n\"The 'Powered' JDAM - an innovative concept that would allow a standard 500-pound bomb to travel several hundred miles as a cruise missile - could provide a cheaper, near-term solution to complement the more expensive PGMs that take years to build,\" he said, adding that they may be able to attack targets at both land and sea.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGallagher stressed that \"reviving and rebuilding an arsenal of deterrence will require a generational investment and mobilization.\"\n\n\"At the same time, we must be realistic about how quickly the munitions industrial base will be able to produce our most essential weapons. We must be creative and think outside the box to come up with solutions,\" he said. \"The urgency of the moment requires nothing less.\"\n\nGallagher requested a classified briefing from the Pentagon next month regarding the agency's plans it has to pursue the weapons systems he has proposed.",

        "body": "'We're very lucky': He's 104, she's 100, and they've been married for 82 yearsKailyn BrownDecember 18, 2023 at 12:00 PM\n\nAs a lively group of elderly women scurried onto a shuttle for a shopping day on a recent Tuesday afternoon, Carla and Jack Weingarten could be found snuggled under a blanket inside their Los Angeles apartment, watching \"I Love Lucy\" episodes on repeat.\n\nCarla, who's 100, and Jack, who turns 105 on Dec. 25, used to look forward to their retirement community's weekly outings. But these days, they prefer a more laid-back afternoon: Sitting side by side in their recliner chairs and watching one of Carla's favorite shows -- Jack mostly just listens because he's lost much of his vision -- as they hold hands for hours.\n\nIn August, Carla and Jack celebrated a major milestone: 82 years of marriage.\n\n\"We're very lucky,\" said Carla, who has short-term memory loss. Then she leaned over toward her husband to encourage him to chime in.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he said in agreement, before kissing her hand tenderly. Jack, whose speech and memory have faded in recent years, used to tell their two sons that the key to a healthy marriage is \"the man always having the last word: 'Yes dear.'\" Jack doesn't talk much nowadays, but when he does, he's typically calling out for Carla or telling her that he loves her multiple times a day.\n\n\"I love you too, Jackie,\" she always responds.\n\nAn estimated 17,000 centenarians live in California, with nearly 6,500 of them in Los Angeles County, according to the California Department of Finance. That number gets even smaller -- roughly 25% as estimated by the Census Bureau's American Community Survey -- when it comes to how many Californians ages 90 and up are still married. According to the Guinness World Records, the longest documented marriage in the world is 86 years.\n\nIn other words, Carla and Jack's long-lasting relationship is somewhat of an anomaly.\n\nThe couple's Hollywood-like love story began in Vienna, where Jack and Carla had been neighbors and family friends since they were kids. Their families also attended the same synagogue, though they didn't pay much attention to each other due to their five-year age difference.\n\nThe family story goes like this: Around 1936, a teenage Jack moved to what was then known as Mandatory Palestine on the advice of a teacher because antisemitism was rapidly rising in Austria and neighboring Germany. Carla fled there a few years later during World War II. Her father thought she'd be safest there because she spoke Hebrew. He'd later be killed in a concentration camp, along with her mother, younger brother and grandparents. Before Carla left Austria, Jack's mother asked her to give him a letter. His mother didn't know exactly where he was living, but she hoped Carla would find him.\n\n\"They grew up together and now they've grown old together, and their relationship remains so strong. [Their marriage] has taught me unconditional love.\"\n\nLindsay Cohen-Weingarten\n\nSoon after she arrived, Carla ran into one of Jack's childhood friends, who told her where he was, and they reunited. Carla doesn't remember what she thought of Jack when she saw him again, but his reaction was laced with the charming sense of humor he's known for, according to their sons. \"You look a lot better now,\" Jack said to 17-year-old Carla. Knowing that she didn't have any family or resources at the time, Jack told her, \"Don't worry. I'll take care of you,\" and he suggested they get married.\n\nThey tied the knot on Aug. 12, 1941, and had their first son, Joel, four years later, then their second son, Henry, in 1950. The young family moved to New York City in 1958 and made their way to Los Angeles a few months later. Jack worked for a children's apparel company, which he eventually took over, while Carla worked as a seamstress and pattern maker. She also taught sewing classes in their garage.\n\n\"They struggled moving to America, but what I respected was that they never brought that to their children,\" said Joel. Unlike some of his friends' parents, Carla and Jack didn't remind him and his brother about the sacrifices they'd made for them, he added. \"I never heard anything from my parents about what they went through. They never looked back, they only looked forward.\"\n\nJack and Carla had a vibrant social life until a couple years ago. First, Jack hurt his head after two falls and had to recuperate during days-long hospital stays. Then he got COVID-19 and pneumonia. But before all that, Jack played bridge competitively for several years. He and Carla would go to every social event at their independent living community and encourage others to attend. If there was a dance floor, they were always on it. \"They're such a loved couple here,\" said Deborah Rivera, the community's business manager. She's known them since they moved into the retirement complex nearly 15 years ago.\n\nThe couple used to travel regularly to places like Hawaii, Austria and Germany, and they have friends of various ages around the world. They've outlived many of their longtime friends. Fluent in multiple languages, including German, Hebrew and French, they typically speak to each other in German.\n\nPhotos from their trips, along with smiling images of their sons, daughters-in-law and three granddaughters, adorn every square foot of their spacious two-bedroom apartment. Carla used to love making personalized cards on her desktop computer for her loved ones' birthdays, but she no longer does that these days.\n\n\"We're lucky,\" Carla said of their lives. \"We thank God. We have no complaints. We have a good place here. We enjoy being here with the people. We have good friends.\"\n\nCarla still exercises every day, and regularly gets her hair and nails done at the community's salon. And when her husband falls asleep in the evenings, she usually goes downstairs to catch up with her friends over a glass of wine. Three other centenarians live at the senior complex, but Carla and Jack are the only married couple, Rivera said.\n\nThe word \"tenderness\" comes to Rivera's mind when she thinks about the Weingartens. They have a \"spark of love that's still there after all these years,\" Rivera said. \"But with them, it's so pure. It's so genuine. You see that they truly just enjoy each other so much still. You see them walking down the hall, they're always holding hands, which is so sweet to see.\"\n\n\"I think that's what is keeping them alive. The fact they have each other.\"\n\nJoel Weingarten\n\n\"I think that's what is keeping them alive,\" added their son, Joel. \"The fact they have each other.\"\n\nCarla and Jack's marriage has also made an impact on their three grandchildren.\n\n\"We all kind of look up to them as a success story and something to strive for because they do love each other so much and really do enjoy each other's company and waking up next to each other,\" said granddaughter Ashton Cohen-Weingarten, 33.\n\n\"They're so committed to each other,\" added her sister, 30-year-old Lindsay Cohen-Weingarten. \"They grew up together and now they've grown old together, and their relationship remains so strong. [Their marriage] has taught me unconditional love.\"\n\nWillie Coronado, one of Carla and Jack's caregivers, has also picked up a few gems from them. Jack told Coronado, who's been married for 23 years, that the secret to \"living happily ever after\" is making sure \"that when you go to bed at night with your wife, things are settled. Don't go to bed upset.\"\n\n\"That's something I keep with me all the time,\" said Coronado, who's worked with the couple for more than a decade. \"I know it's not easy, but I know he has so much wisdom in those words.\"\n\nBack in Carla and Jack's cozy apartment, Lucille Ball bounced on the TV screen in their living room. While a housekeeper tidied up their bedroom and a caretaker prepared their lunch, Jack began drifting off to sleep as he and his wife held hands. He didn't let go -- and neither did she.\n\nSign up for L.A. Goes Out, a weekly newsletter about exploring and experiencing Los Angeles from the L.A.

        "title": "BRICS Nations Unite: Bitcoin Central to Challenging US Dollar Dominance in 'Fair World Order",
        "body": "The notable difference between the United States-led G7 coalition and the Russian-led BRICS movement has created a favorable environment for the nature of Bitcoin as a global reserve currency and digital asset.\n\nThe adoption of the flagship crypto asset, Bitcoin (BTC), as the global reserve currency continues to gradually challenge and shake legacy nuclear-powerful countries like the United States and Russia. The success demonstrated by El Salvador adopting Bitcoin as the legal tender has significantly influenced most investors to channel their savings to the mother coins and alternative digital assets.\n\nMoreover, Bitcoin price performance has outperformed all the precious metals and stock market indexes in the past five years, and historical data analysis coupled with fundamentals at hand shows the trend will continue in the coming decades.\n\nThe Russian head of state, Vladimir Putin, spoke last week regarding the 2024 BRICS alliance summit, which is scheduled to take place in the city of Kaza. Under Russia's chairmanship, Putin indicated that the summit will focus on ensuring the world is a fair place not ruled by Western civilization's political interest.\n\nNotably, the BRICS alliance has been advocating for the member states to use their respective currencies to empower their forex market and enhance de-dollarization. The BRICS alliance has been pushing to have a common currency that unites member states, but the logistics have remained a challenge due to the entrenched use of the US dollar.\n\nAs for the 'rules-based world order,' there are no such rules; in reality, they change every day depending on the current political agenda and the transitory interests of those [who are constantly]talking about it. The 2024 BRICS summit will demonstrate that there are enough forces in this world, powerful countries who want to live not in accordance with those unwritten rules, but rather in accordance with the rules enshrined in fundamental, cornerstone documents, which include the United Nations Charter, and those who are guided by their interests and those of their partners, who do not impose anything on anyone, and do not create any military blocs, while fostering the conditions for effective joint development,\n\nThe ongoing wars in Ukraine and Israel have significantly complicated global geopolitical differences, forcing economists to review their short-term and long-term agendas. Nonetheless, it is evident that more people do not support the killing of innocent lives to propel the agenda of certain individuals in power.",

        "title": "Azura Ophthalmics Announces Positive Results from Phase 2 Clinical Trial of AZR-MD-001 in Patients with Contact Lens Discomfort",
        "body": "Patients in the AZR-MD-001 arm gained at least three hours of comfortable contact lens wear time daily and had improvements in both tear break up time and ocular surface staining\n\nTEL AVIV, Israel & MELBOURNE, Australia--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Azura Ophthalmics Ltd., a clinical-stage biopharmaceutical company developing a new therapeutic class of Ophthalmic Keratolytics for ocular surface diseases, today announced positive topline efficacy and safety results from a Phase 2 study of AZR-MD-001 in patients with Contact Lens Discomfort (CLD) who could not comfortably wear their lenses as desired and who demonstrated signs of Meibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD). The trial met its primary endpoint of showing a statistically significant improvement in Meibomian Glands Yielding Liquid Secretion (MGYLS; number of open glands).\n\nThe study also met additional secondary and clinically meaningful endpoints, including significant improvements in meibum quality (measured by Meibomian Gland Score, MGS); tear stability (measured by tear break up time, TBUT); ocular surface staining (measured by both fluorescein and lissamine green staining); and contact lens wear time. AZR-MD-001 was safe and well tolerated. All observed adverse events were mild to moderate in severity and none resulted in treatment discontinuation. This is the second positive Phase 2 study of AZR-MD-001 to demonstrate statistically significant improvements across multiple sign and symptom endpoints in patients with MGD.\n\n\"MGD is the root cause of many downstream ocular surface conditions that impact quality of life and vision for patients, including Contact Lens Discomfort. By opening up blocked glands and improving the quality of the tear film, we believe many of these ocular surface conditions can be resolved,\" said Marc Gleeson, Chief Executive Officer of Azura. \"In addition to meeting its primary MGYLS endpoint, we are especially encouraged that AZD-MD-001 allowed patients who had given up using contacts to wear their contacts again - safely and comfortably - for an additional three hours every day over their normal wear time. We now have two studies showing AZR-MD-001 can improve the signs and symptoms of MGD and we look forward to discussing these results with the FDA as we advance our Phase 3 development program.\"\n\nMGD is a chronic condition that causes the glands in the eyelids to become blocked, impacting the quality and quantity of meibum secretions in the upper and lower eyelids. This leads to several downstream ocular surface symptoms including dryness, pain, irritation, reduced quality of vision, and Contact Lens Discomfort. Many patients who have signs of ocular surface disease including MGD and who would like to wear contact lenses find they cannot wear them for as long as desired and may stop using contact lenses if wearing them becomes too bothersome or uncomfortable.\n\n\"MGD is one of the causes of Contact Lens Discomfort, and many patients give up on wearing contact lenses altogether due to the irritation they experience. Innovation in contact lens design and materials intended to offer a more comfortable patient experience has stalled, with reports of discomfort at the end of the day being similar for the past 20 years. This leaves patients frustrated and seeking alternative vision correction options,\" said Lyndon Jones, Ph.D., Director and Professor at the Centre for Ocular Research & Education in Ontario, Canada. \"With these AZR-MD-001 data, I'm encouraged to see a potential treatment that may address the underlying cause of Contact Lens Discomfort, and I believe my patients would find an extra three hours of comfortable contact lens wear time to be very meaningful.\"\n\nAbout the Contact Lens Discomfort Study (ClinicalTrials.gov ID NCT05548491)\n\nThe Phase 2 trial was a multi-center, vehicle-controlled study that evaluated the safety and efficacy of AZR-MD-001 0.5% compared to its vehicle in 67 patients diagnosed with Contact Lens Discomfort who could not comfortably wear their contact lenses as desired and who had signs of MGD. Patients self-administered AZR-MD-001 or its vehicle to the lower eyelid at bedtime twice weekly for 3 months. The prospectively defined primary efficacy endpoint was the number of open glands as measured by the MGYLS score. Secondary endpoints included comfortable contact lens wear time reported in minutes, corneal and conjunctival staining using the Oxford scale, and responder analyses based upon published thresholds for MGYLS and MGS. The trial was supported by a clinical stream (Medical Research Future Fund ESTAC) grant from CUREator, a biotechnology incubator run by Brandon BioCatalyst to support and accelerate the development of Australian biomedical research and innovations.\n\nAZR-MD-001 0.5% achieved statistically significant differences compared to vehicle in both signs and symptoms at month 3:\n\nAll Treatment-Emergent Adverse Events (TEAEs) were mild to moderate with no serious treatment-related AEs. No patients discontinued the study due to adverse events.\n\nAbout Contact Lens Discomfort\n\nContact Lens Discomfort (CLD) is a condition characterized by episodic or persistent adverse ocular sensations related to lens wear, either with or without visual disturbance, that can lead to decreased wear time and discontinuation of contact lens use. CLD patients experience symptoms of ocular discomfort (e.g., dryness, irritation, discomfort, fatigue) that increase in severity over the day while the patient is wearing the contact lenses. CLD remains a major reason for discontinuation of contact lens use despite years of research into optimizing lens design and materials for the ocular environment. There are currently more than 140 million contact lens wearers worldwide and studies report that between 12% and 51% of lens wearers ''drop out'' of contact lens wear, citing CLD as the primary reason for discontinuation.\n\nAbout Meibomian Gland Dysfunction\n\nMeibomian Gland Dysfunction (MGD) is a chronic and progressive condition associated with blockage of the meibomian glands and alteration in the quality of expressed meibum which can end in gland atrophy. It is a leading cause of Dry Eye Disease and contributor to Contact Lens Discomfort.MGD is commonly characterized by terminal duct obstruction and/or qualitative/quantitative changes in glandular secretion. There are no approved prescription pharmaceutical agents that specifically treat these glandular changes. If left untreated, MGD will alter the tear film, which can initiate or exacerbate additional ocular surface diseases such as Dry Eye Disease. Severe DED is associated with an increased risk for corneal ulcers and ocular infections. Approximately 30-40 million people are diagnosed with MGD in the United States, with the total prevalent population estimated at 100 million Americans.\n\nAbout AZR-MD-001\n\nAzura's lead clinical-stage, investigational drug candidate AZR-MD-001 harnesses the power of selenium sulfide (SeS) in an easy-to-use ophthalmic ointment preparation applied directly to the meibomian glands in the lower eyelid. AZR-MD-001 is thought to have a multi-modal mechanism of action that treats the pathophysiology of MGD along with the resulting ocular surface symptoms. It breaks down the bonds between abnormal keratin proteins to soften the blockage, slows down the production of keratin to prevent future blockages, and increases the quality and quantity of meibum produced by the meibomian glands.\n\nAZR-MD-001 is currently being studied to evaluate the safety, efficacy, and tolerability of the study drug in patients with clinical signs of MGD.\n\nAbout Azura Ophthalmics, Ltd.\n\nAzura Ophthalmics is utilizing our deep understanding of ocular surface diseases and drug development to deliver a new therapeutic class of Ophthalmic Keratolytics to treat underserved ophthalmic conditions. Our differentiated approach combines ophthalmologic and dermatologic solutions to harness the unique properties of keratolytics to treat the root cause of numerous underserved ocular indications. Our internally discovered pipeline of new chemical entities allows us to develop a portfolio of first-in-class ophthalmic therapeutics for significant unmet needs.

        "title": "Blessing: An ancient posture for a modern church",
        "body": "As a priest, I give a lot of blessings. Usually, this happens in the church: I bless baptismal water, bread and wine for communion, and members of my congregation. One of my favorite parts of our Sunday service is what many traditions call \"the benediction\" -- at the conclusion of worship, God's people are sent out into the world with His blessing, an awareness of His presence and power in their daily lives.\n\nBut somewhat surprisingly, many historic rites of blessing are designed to happen outside of church. Ministers visit the hospital to bless the dying. We bless newborn babies tucked in their bassinets at home. There are also blessings for houses, workplaces, and even -- thanks to St. Francis -- animals.\n\nWe might find all this blessing of people and items a bit excessive. Or we could appreciate these rituals as a nice sentiment, even if a bit archaic. But I believe the ancient practice of blessing can help us recover an important aspect of our vocation in the world today.\n\nIn the Bible, blessing is always an interpersonal reality. Proximity to God confers blessedness with all its benefits. Separation from God is a curse. Creation was blessed in God's presence, and the seventh day was blessed as having a special relationship to God (Gen. 1-2). Similarly, Israel's first priestly blessing described God's favor in terms of his nearness: \"The Lord bless you and keep you, the Lord make his face to shine upon you ... the Lord lift up his countenance upon you and give you peace\" (Num. 6:24-26). To be near to God is to be blessed.\n\nThis blessing-by-proximity even extends to God's people, who act as His representatives in the world. When God called Abram to be the father of the Jewish people, He said, \"I will bless you ... and you will be a blessing. I will bless those who bless you, and whoever curses you I will curse; and all peoples on earth will be blessed through you\" (Gen. 12:1-3). From the beginning, God's people were called to be not merely recipients of God's friendship and favor, but conveyors of it.\n\nEarly Christians embraced this ministry by blessing, or setting apart, all kinds of people and things as God's. By praying over everything from their evening meal to their enemies, Christians lived like priests, asking for God's presence to sanctify and heal the world around them. Rather than withdrawing from their secular and unbelieving environment, the New Testament church sought to be instruments of God's blessing within it. The apostle Paul even suggested that their faithful proximity can make unbelievers holy (1 Cor. 7:14).\n\nThis calling to carry God's blessing to the world is a far cry from the social media style humble-brag \"hashtag blessed\" (#blessed) that has caricatured Christianity in recent years. And it critiques the combative, culture war mentality that fuels suspicion and resentment toward those who don't share our values. God's blessing is not a commodity to be displayed or a weapon to be wielded. It is a gift to be given.\n\nAs Christmas approaches, we revisit the supreme act through which God blessed the world. In becoming a human being, God bestowed the gift of His presence among us. He became proximate to creation by entering into it through the womb of a woman. The major themes of Advent invite us to reflect on the fact that though we deserve judgment, God extends mercy. To a world in darkness, God comes as light. In the face of Jesus, God has literally \"lifted up his countenance\" upon us to give us peace. As the familiar hymn says, he has come near \"to make his blessings flow far as the curse is found.\"\n\nThe Incarnation conclusively demonstrates God's posture toward the stuff of earth. And we are called to follow suit. We renounce Satan and his work, but we name creation as good and reclaim it as God's. Through His people, God is restoring the whole world to a kind of sacredness: as a place where He will dwell forever (Rev. 21:1-5). This means our primary ministry is to bless, not to banish. One day Satan will be defeated, but our call to bless creation will remain.\n\nPractically speaking, this looks like abandoning an adversarial or even an apathetic mindset toward the spaces and relationships we inhabit. However \"secular\" or hostile our environment may be, we are called to bless and not to curse (Rom. 12:14). We also can ask for a sanctified imagination regarding the material world in our care: how might God's presence renew and enhance whatever small corners of creation He has given us? How might we set apart our homes, our tables, our backyards and neighborhood schools as places to meet with God?\n\nAnd lastly, to become the kind of people who can bring God's blessing to others, we must reflect on the ways we need to be transformed as well. Our call to host His presence requires that we also be sanctified -- reclaimed and renewed in His image. This ongoing process prevents us from falling into triumphalism or pride. But understanding God's posture toward us, in all our persisting sin and dysfunction, also prevents us from falling into self-hatred and shame. He has chosen, once for all, to come near. He has called us very good. He has promised to sanctify us completely, that He might dwell with us forever. This is the hope we have to share.",

        "body": "CFE has an option in the agreement to double the volume of the order for another ~$4.5 million; this deal for multiple GenCell green power systems follows earlier orders for 74 units in recent years already deployed by CFE\n\nRami Reshef, CEO and co-founder, GenCell, said, \"The follow-up order we received from our local partner in Mexico for the Federal Electricity Commission of the State of Mexico CFE represents a significant vote of confidence in GenCell and in our resilient, sustainable, long-duration and zero-emission backup power systems ensuring uninterrupted flow of power to the substations and communication systems of CFE. Over the past two years, GenCell's products have been deployed at numerous substations across Mexico, delivering exceptional performance and results. This broadly distributed implementation offers demonstrated proof of GenCell's tested capability to supply power solutions that are both resilient and long-duration as well as zero-emission. We appreciate CFE's continuing trust in GenCell's solutions and believe that this deal will make a significant contribution towards expansion of GenCell's operations vis-à-vis other power utilities around the world as part of GenCell's steady path of growth.\"\n\nPETAH TIKVA, Israel, Dec. 18, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- GenCell Energy, GNCL, a leading provider of Hydrogen2Power™ and Ammonia2Power™ solutions, announces today an additional phase in its strategic cooperation with the Federal Electricity Commission of the State of Mexico CFE, the state-owned power utility. GenCell is honored to announce a repeat order from CFE valued at ~$4.5 million for the supply and delivery of mutiple additional GenCell systems and services. The Company intends to deliver the Systems to its local partner in Mexico before the end of the calendar year 2023. For fulfillment of its obligations as per the agreement, the Company is expected to receive payment in several installments until the end of the first half of 2024, subject to the Local Partner receiving payment from CFE in accordance with the terms of the additional tender.\n\nThis deal follows the successful delivery and satisfactory operation of 74 of the Company's systems over the last two years. The additional units being purchased will also provide backup power to CFE substations; moreover, the tender grants CFE the right within the first six months of 2024 to increase the number of units in the order by up to double the current amount.\n\nThe current deal was signed after CFE held another tender to purchase additional backup power equipment and selected GenCell's local partner in Mexico as its winner. Consequently, GenCell will supply its systems along with support services for the warranty period stipulated in the additional tender to its local partner in Mexico, who will deploy and maintain the GenCell systems.\n\nGenCell is confident that the winning of the additional tender by its local partner is an indication of the satisfaction CFE derived from the GenCell backup power systems which were supplied and deployed successfully in the previous CFE tender. The Company believes that this transaction may contribute to its positioning in its target markets and, in alignment with its strategy and objectives, may help GenCell expand its operations with new clients in the utilities markets.\n\nGenCell Energy GNCL develops total green power solutions based on reliable, zero-emission alkaline fuel cells, Hydrogen2Power™, Ammonia2Power™ and Water2Power™ technologies that deliver uninterrupted power to help the world #SayNoToDiesel and transition to clean energy. The ability to produce not only clean power from GenCell's fuel cells, but also the green fuel on which the fuel cells run, sets GenCell in a far superior position as a well-to-wheel total green energy solution provider. GenCell delivers resilient, robust and weather-resistant backup power for utilities, telecom, EV charging and other mission-critical applications which have been deployed in 23 countries. Our ammonia-based hydrogen-on-demand solution is designed to provide primary power for off-grid and poor-grid sites, as well as for rural electrification.

        "title": "New Border Security and Ukraine Aid Deal Faces Uncertain Future",
        "body": "Negotiators in the Senate are facing significant challenges as they work towards finalizing a border security deal alongside additional aid for Ukraine. The discussions, which are taking place behind closed doors with the Biden administration and top Senate aides, have been complex and have yet to yield a complete agreement. While progress has been made on certain aspects of the border language, the negotiators have not been able to release a framework or summary of the deal.\n\nSenator James Lankford, one of the key Republican negotiators, has acknowledged that a realistic timeline for completion is likely in January, when the House is back in session. Despite their efforts to expedite the process, it is anticipated that approving the bill on the Senate floor could take a week or even longer.\n\nThe negotiations are centered around the border security measures requested by House and Senate Republicans as a condition for passing President Joe Biden's $106 billion aid package, which includes support for Ukraine and Israel. Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer has even canceled a week of holiday recess to allow the negotiations to continue. However, the prospects of releasing the full legislative text of the bill before the end of the month are uncertain. While a framework of the agreement could be presented to demonstrate progress, both Republican and Democratic members have emphasized the need to review the text before voting.\n\nThe difficulty in reaching an agreement on border security policy changes is a reflection of the deeply divided Congress, where attempts at immigration reform often fail. GOP senators previously blocked Biden's spending request due to the absence of border security measures. The urgency to find a resolution before the holiday break has increased pressure on the negotiators, particularly as Ukraine urgently seeks additional U.S. aid amidst its ongoing war with Russia.\n\nIn an effort to advance the aid request, Sens. Lankford, Sinema, and Murphy met with top aides to Senate leaders and Biden administration officials, including Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas. Despite these discussions, Minority Leader Mitch McConnell has warned that a potential vote this week will fail unless the remaining issues are fully addressed. The technical work involved in drafting the bill has become a time-consuming process that must be executed accurately for the bill to progress successfully.\n\nWhile Schumer has the ability to prompt another vote this week, no firm decision has been made on whether to proceed. It is likely that the Senate will focus on confirming nominations and extending an expiring FAA bill instead. Additionally, a group of conservative senators has raised concerns about the secretive nature of the negotiations, calling for a Republican conference meeting in January when the House is expected to reconvene.\n\nAs the discussions continue, it is evident that there are complex policy details that still need to be resolved. These include raising the asylum standard for immigrants claiming credible fear, establishing an expedited removal process, and defining new expulsion authorities. Republicans are also advocating for policies that Democrats largely oppose, such as a transit ban and changes to parole authority. These divergent viewpoints add another layer of complexity to the negotiations, further complicating their outcome this year.\n\nThe negotiators in the Senate are facing challenges and have yet to reach a complete agreement on the border security deal and Ukraine aid package. While progress has been made on certain aspects, there is still work to be done before a framework or summary can be released.\n\nIt is anticipated that the negotiations will continue into January when the House is back in session. Senator James Lankford has stated that waiting until January for final votes is a realistic timeline for completing their work.\n\nGOP senators blocked Biden's spending request because it lacked the necessary border security policy changes. Immigration reform has been a contentious issue in Congress, making it difficult to reach a consensus on such matters.\n\nThe negotiators are still working through several complex policy details, including raising the asylum standard, establishing an expedited removal process, and defining new expulsion authorities. Republicans are also advocating for additional policies that Democrats largely oppose.\n\nGiven the challenges and the divided nature of Congress, it is difficult to predict an exact timeline for resolution. The negotiations will continue, but the outcome remains uncertain at this time.",

        "title": "10 years on, the impact of Biden's Holocaust survivor initiative is still growing",
        "body": "On Dec. 10, 2013, I braved the cold that had shut down Washington, D.C., to hear then-Vice President Joe Biden address the American Jewish Joint Distribution Committee's centennial anniversary luncheon and make an announcement with tremendous potential to improve the lives of Holocaust survivors.\n\nAs an advocate for Jewish Federations and family service agencies, I had spent 2013 in near daily contact with the White House, Congress, local service providers and philanthropists, making the case for Holocaust survivors in the U.S. -- a population whose unique needs required innovative solutions from government and civil society. I knew that today Biden would launch the result of all of our ideas and efforts: the White House Holocaust Survivor Initiative, a public-private partnership to address pressing needs of Holocaust survivors as they age.\n\nThe announcement was a watershed moment. The ensuing program has touched the lives of more than 40,000 Holocaust survivors; and it has spurred a national movement to help all older adults as they age, using lessons from Holocaust survivors. The Jewish community has developed and shared the person-centered, trauma-informed (PCTI) approach to care -- an innovative framework that has proven successful at helping survivors and other older adults by recognizing the impact of trauma -- and created a national resource center, authorized by Congress, with the aim of spreading PCTI care throughout aging services.\n\nThanks to dedicated philanthropists and the bipartisan support of Congress's Holocaust Survivor Assistance Program (HSAP), a Holocaust survivor in Detroit learned to text her granddaughter through her iPad; a survivor in New Jersey received pro-bono dental care; an African American senior had her broken sink and toilet repaired by a technician trained in PCTI care; and a family caregiver felt the \"weight of the world lifted\" from her shoulders when the local Jewish human service agency stepped in to provide supports.\n\nToday, our Center on Holocaust Survivor Care and Institute on Aging and Trauma is the only entity dedicated to funding, learning, and sharing the most promising practices of serving Holocaust survivors, so we may develop tools to help all older adults with a history of trauma and their family caregivers. With as many as 90% of older adults having a history of trauma, the learnings from Holocaust survivors provide pivotal knowledge for all aging services.\n\nThe horrific events of Oct. 7 and the subsequent surge of antisemitism has re-traumatized many Holocaust survivors. We know that empowerment is key to the PCTI approach, which is why we helped 870 Holocaust survivors make their voices heard, penning a letter to President Biden expressing support for Israel. Ahead of the annual White House Hanukkah party, President Biden held a private meeting with Holocaust survivors to hear their stories and learn from their wisdom.\n\nLooking back on the White House announcement ten years ago, I recall how thrilled I was to thank Biden for supporting Holocaust survivors. He was right when he said we can accomplish more if we work together. And while we're proud of our achievements of the past decade, the biggest impact is yet to come. As more foundations, state and local governments, and private-sector companies join our mission and invest in the caring principles we have mastered, we will be able to continue scaling programs that improve life for older adults and their families.\n\nThe Jewish community is well positioned to lead this charge. We have experienced collective trauma, and we have learned from it. Crisis upon crisis, we have persisted and risen to meet contemporary challenges. For so many years, Holocaust survivors have been our teachers and our heroes. In the years to come, their legacy will continue to teach us about how to make the world better for all people.",

        "title": "Study: $56.6 Billion Was Spent on Video Games in 2022. Here Are 3 Gaming Stocks on the Rise. | The Motley Fool",
        "body": "Microsoft's recent acquisition of Activision Blizzard signals tremendous value in owners of top gaming brands.\n\nPlaying video games has become a mainstream form of entertainment for millions of Americans. Players in the U.S. spent $56 billion on games in 2022, according to the NPD Group, and the figure is much larger when considering worldwide markets. Industry specialist Newzoo estimates that the global revenue from games will be $184 billion in 2023.\n\nThe industry has been growing for the last 50 years. It's an attractive market in which to find overlooked growth stocks that might be undervalued.\n\nIts prospects even led Microsoft to spend $68 billion to keep one of the leading game companies, Activision Blizzard, all to itself. Microsoft's acquisition shows that owning shares of top game producers could be a rewarding move in the next decade.\n\nWhat follows are three video game stocks that would make great buys before the end of 2023.\n\nAmong the top video game companies in the world, Take-Two Interactive (TTWO -2.25%) is one of the best to consider right now. Take-Two is home to popular franchises like Grand Theft Auto and NBA 2K, which sell millions of copies every year.\n\nThe stock returned 867% over the last 10 years, and there are a few important reasons to expect more upside over the next few years.\n\nTake-Two owns 44 proprietary gaming brands, and it selectively publishes games that are licensed, including sports series like NBA 2K and PGA Tour. When you have a game like Grand Theft V that has sold 190 million copies, you don't have to take chances on unproven concepts.\n\nTake-Two has leaned into releasing sequels of its existing games, including Red Dead Redemption, that already have a large following. This aligns with management's goal to reduce risks while continuing to grow the value of the business for shareholders.\n\nTake-Two's Rockstar Games studio just released the first official trailer for Grand Theft Auto VI (GTA VI), currently scheduled for release in calendar 2025. It garnered more than 146 million views on YouTube in the first 10 days.\n\nManagement is guiding for record adjusted revenue, or bookings, of nearly $8 billion in fiscal 2025, ending in March. It expects fiscal 2026 revenue to grow again. The stock has been moving higher this year but still trades at a forward price-to-sales ratio of 3.58 based on fiscal 2025 estimates. That leaves room for more upside leading up to the release of this blockbuster.\n\nOver the long term, Take-Two has other titles with the potential for growth in sales, including previous hits like L.A. Noire, Borderlands, and future installments in the Red Dead Redemption series, which is made by the same studio that created Grand Theft Auto.\n\nThe Israel-based mobile-game maker Playtika (PLTK -3.24%) is not as widely recognized as Take-Two but is an up-and-comer in the industry that investors should know about.\n\nMobile games make up about half of the industry's annual revenue, rivaling the spending on more-established gaming platforms like consoles and PCs. Playtika checks an important box for investors with its record of solid financial results. It generated a net profit of $285 million on revenue of $2.5 billion over the last year, and it's been growing those totals at double-digit annual rates in recent years, partly through acquisitions of other game studios.\n\nMobile games can be a high-risk endeavor for an upstart studio, but Playtika's profitable growth since its founding in 2010 demonstrates its ability to make games and acquire other studios that generate growing profits for shareholders.\n\nMost importantly, Playtika has shown the ability to monetize its free-to-play games with in-app purchases over many years, which is not easy to do in the mobile market. It released its first game, Slotomania, more than 10 years ago, and it remains the company's largest game based on revenue.\n\nThe market sell-off last year sent the stock well off its highs, and it is currently trading around 72% below its initial public offering in 2021. However, the shares offer incredible value right now, trading at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of just 9.3. This seems to deeply undervalue Playtika's record of growth and future opportunities in the mobile game market.\n\nThe last rising star in this industry that investors should consider is Roblox (RBLX -1.35%). It's a popular platform where players can interact in 3D worlds and engage in experiences beyond games, such as virtual music concerts. Roblox experienced tremendous growth in recent years, but the stock's recent haircut could be a great buying opportunity.\n\nOver the last three years, daily active users have nearly doubled from 36 million to 70 million. The platform just launched on Sony's PlayStation console, which led to 15 million downloads in the first month. This bodes well for near-term growth in users and monetization opportunities to grow the value of the business.\n\nRevenue has almost tripled since 2020 to $2.6 billion, with bookings up 20% year over year in the third quarter. Most of the company's revenue is generated from sales of virtual currency that players use to purchase premium content. The more the user base grows, the more creators want to make content for the platform, which keeps revenue growing.\n\nThe stock is trading well off its previous peak but is starting to move higher. Management said it would start to moderate its operating expenses and capital investments. This means more profitable growth that could lift the stock out of its recent slump.",

        "title": "'We're very lucky': He's 104, she's 100, and they've been married for 82 years",
        "body": "As a lively group of elderly women scurried onto a shuttle for a shopping day on a recent Tuesday afternoon, Carla and Jack Weingarten could be found snuggled under a blanket inside their Los Angeles apartment, watching \"I Love Lucy\" episodes on repeat.\n\nCarla, who's 100, and Jack, who turns 105 on Dec. 25, used to look forward to their retirement community's weekly outings. But these days, they prefer a more laid-back afternoon: Sitting side by side in their recliner chairs and watching one of Carla's favorite shows -- Jack mostly just listens because he's lost much of his vision -- as they hold hands for hours.\n\nIn August, Carla and Jack celebrated a major milestone: 82 years of marriage.\n\n\"We're very lucky,\" said Carla, who has short-term memory loss. Then she leaned over toward her husband to encourage him to chime in.\n\n\"Yeah,\" he said in agreement, before kissing her hand tenderly. Jack, whose speech and memory have faded in recent years, used to tell their two sons that the key to a healthy marriage is \"the man always having the last word: 'Yes dear.'\" Jack doesn't talk much nowadays, but when he does, he's typically calling out for Carla or telling her that he loves her multiple times a day.\n\nAn estimated 17,000 centenarians live in California, with nearly 6,500 of them in Los Angeles County, according to the California Department of Finance. That number gets even smaller -- roughly 25% as estimated by the Census Bureau's American Community Survey -- when it comes to how many Californians ages 90 and up are still married. According to the Guinness World Records, the longest documented marriage in the world is 86 years.\n\nIn other words, Carla and Jack's long-lasting relationship is somewhat of an anomaly.\n\nThe couple's Hollywood-like love story began in Vienna, where Jack and Carla had been neighbors and family friends since they were kids. Their families also attended the same synagogue, though they didn't pay much attention to each other due to their five-year age difference.\n\nThe family story goes like this: Around 1936, a teenage Jack moved to what was then known as Mandatory Palestine on the advice of a teacher because antisemitism was rapidly rising in Austria and neighboring Germany. Carla fled there a few years later during World War II. Her father thought she'd be safest there because she spoke Hebrew. He'd later be killed in a concentration camp, along with her mother, younger brother and grandparents. Before Carla left Austria, Jack's mother asked her to give him a letter. His mother didn't know exactly where he was living, but she hoped Carla would find him.\n\nSoon after she arrived, Carla ran into one of Jack's childhood friends, who told her where he was, and they reunited. Carla doesn't remember what she thought of Jack when she saw him again, but his reaction was laced with the charming sense of humor he's known for, according to their sons. \"You look a lot better now,\" Jack said to 17-year-old Carla. Knowing that she didn't have any family or resources at the time, Jack told her, \"Don't worry. I'll take care of you,\" and he suggested they get married.\n\nThey tied the knot on Aug. 12, 1941, and had their first son, Joel, four years later, then their second son, Henry, in 1950. The young family moved to New York City in 1958 and made their way to Los Angeles a few months later. Jack worked for a children's apparel company, which he eventually took over, while Carla worked as a seamstress and pattern maker. She also taught sewing classes in their garage.\n\n\"They struggled moving to America, but what I respected was that they never brought that to their children,\" said Joel. Unlike some of his friends' parents, Carla and Jack didn't remind him and his brother about the sacrifices they'd made for them, he added. \"I never heard anything from my parents about what they went through. They never looked back, they only looked forward.\"\n\nJack and Carla had a vibrant social life until a couple years ago. First, Jack hurt his head after two falls and had to recuperate during days-long hospital stays. Then he got COVID-19 and pneumonia. But before all that, Jack played bridge competitively for several years. He and Carla would go to every social event at their independent living community and encourage others to attend. If there was a dance floor, they were always on it. \"They're such a loved couple here,\" said Deborah Rivera, the community's business manager. She's known them since they moved into the retirement complex nearly 15 years ago.\n\nThe couple used to travel regularly to places like Hawaii, Austria and Germany, and they have friends of various ages around the world. They've outlived many of their longtime friends. Fluent in multiple languages, including German, Hebrew and French, they typically speak to each other in German.\n\nPhotos from their trips, along with smiling images of their sons, daughters-in-law and three granddaughters, adorn every square foot of their spacious two-bedroom apartment. Carla used to love making personalized cards on her desktop computer for her loved ones' birthdays, but she no longer does that these days.\n\n\"We're lucky,\" Carla said of their lives. \"We thank God. We have no complaints. We have a good place here. We enjoy being here with the people. We have good friends.\"\n\nCarla still exercises every day, and regularly gets her hair and nails done at the community's salon. And when her husband falls asleep in the evenings, she usually goes downstairs to catch up with her friends over a glass of wine. Three other centenarians live at the senior complex, but Carla and Jack are the only married couple, Rivera said.\n\nThe word \"tenderness\" comes to Rivera's mind when she thinks about the Weingartens. They have a \"spark of love that's still there after all these years,\" Rivera said. \"But with them, it's so pure. It's so genuine. You see that they truly just enjoy each other so much still. You see them walking down the hall, they're always holding hands, which is so sweet to see.\"\n\n\"I think that's what is keeping them alive,\" added their son, Joel. \"The fact they have each other.\"\n\nCarla and Jack's marriage has also made an impact on their three grandchildren.\n\n\"We all kind of look up to them as a success story and something to strive for because they do love each other so much and really do enjoy each other's company and waking up next to each other,\" said granddaughter Ashton Cohen-Weingarten, 33.\n\n\"They're so committed to each other,\" added her sister, 30-year-old Lindsay Cohen-Weingarten. \"They grew up together and now they've grown old together, and their relationship remains so strong. [Their marriage] has taught me unconditional love.\"\n\nWillie Coronado, one of Carla and Jack's caregivers, has also picked up a few gems from them. Jack told Coronado, who's been married for 23 years, that the secret to \"living happily ever after\" is making sure \"that when you go to bed at night with your wife, things are settled. Don't go to bed upset.\"\n\n\"That's something I keep with me all the time,\" said Coronado, who's worked with the couple for more than a decade. \"I know it's not easy, but I know he has so much wisdom in those words.\"\n\nBack in Carla and Jack's cozy apartment, Lucille Ball bounced on the TV screen in their living room. While a housekeeper tidied up their bedroom and a caretaker prepared their lunch, Jack began drifting off to sleep as he and his wife held hands. He didn't let go -- and neither did she.",

        "title": "12 Most Promising Clean Energy Stocks According to Analysts",
        "body": "In this piece, we will take a look at the 12 most promising clean energy stocks according to analysts. If you want to skip our analysis of the clean energy industry and the latest news, then take a look at 5 Most Promising Clean Energy Stocks According to Analysts.\n\nThe clean energy industry made up primarily of renewable energy sources such as solar and wind power, has been at the center of media coverage as 2023 comes to an end. This is because of the COP28 climate conference held in Dubai and attended by dignitaries from all over the world. Despite the controversies that surfaced before the event, its conclusion saw countries agree to \"transition away\" from fossil fuels. This language drew sharp criticism as the delegates were criticized for not doing enough and committing to a full fossil fuel phaseout.\n\nYet, while fossil fuels as a whole were not on the execution table, COP28 did see the U.S. agree to phase out coal from its energy supply chain. U.S. Special Envoy John Kerry revealed at the event that his country had agreed to stop building new coal power plants and phase out existing ones. Another key development, especially when it comes to the corporate side of things, was the Oil and Gas Decarbonization Charter. This charter, which seeks to end gas flaring by 2030, become net zero by 2050, and zero out methane emissions, was signed by some of the biggest oil companies in the world such as Exxon Mobil Corporation (NYSE:XOM), Shell plc (NYSE:SHEL), and Equinor ASA (NYSE:EQNR). Together, all these signatories control 40% of the world's oil production. However, the initiative was also the center of criticism, with the research group Climate Action Tracker calling the decarbonization charter:\n\nAnother major development at the COP28, especially when it comes to the clean energy industry, was the Global Renewables and Energy Efficiency Pledge. This is an initiative of which 130 countries are part of, and it seeks to triple global installed renewable energy capacity to 11 terawatts by 2030. It is particularly notable since the developed world, made of countries such as the United States and the European Union block, is also joined by others such as Brazil, Nigeria, and Chile. However, while the commitments by more than a hundred countries are notable, the fact that China and India are not part of this list is worrying. Insider Monkey's coverage of 25 Countries that Produce the most Carbon Dioxide Emissions shows that China is part of this list, while India and China are both present in our coverage of 20 Countries That Produce the Most Coal.\n\nThis makes it clear that the clean energy industry is set to thrive. After the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine which shook the global oil supply chain, renewable energy sources were put on the back burner as governments and companies focused on maintaining stability of fossil fuel supply. When coupled with rapid interest rate hikes that have upended global capital markets, clean and renewable energy have continued their drop in 2023. For example, consider the performance of the Invesco Global Clean Energy UCITS ETF from the start of January 2023 to December 11th, 2023 (the day before the clean energy initiatives were announced). During this time period, the ETF was down by 20.4%, after posting some gains during the stock market frenzy of H1 2023. However, immediately after the COP28 initiatives were announced, the ETF gained 9.6% on the market. The stock market is an estimation of investors' expectations for the future, so it can be concluded that cOP28 led them to become positive about clean energy's future.\n\nYet, while the COP28 commitments are less than a month old, investors have already been piling into the clean energy sector. We took a look at these investments as part of our coverage of 12 Best Clean Energy Stocks To Buy According to Billionaires. In this list, the top three stocks that billionaire owned or led hedge funds had bought during Q3 2023 were Sunrun Inc. (NASDAQ:RUN), Enphase Energy, Inc. (NASDAQ:ENPH), and First Solar, Inc.

        "title": "This week's TV: Farewell to 'Curb,' Happy Birthday to Dick Van Dyke, and welcome to 'Extended Family' - The Boston Globe",
        "body": "The comedy, which premiered in 2000 (after a one-hour special in 1999), was stronger at the beginning, like so many of TV's long runners. But each of the later seasons usually featured a few top-notch episodes and memorable riffs -- I still smile when I think of the awful actress from the most recent season in 2021 -- and the delays between the later seasons helped to keep the show from wearing out its welcome. Thanks to HBO's loose approach, David only made the show when he was inspired to.\n\nLike \"Seinfeld,\" \"Curb Your Enthusiasm\" has been fairly influential. It didn't invent the idea of actors playing exaggerated versions of themselves, but it made it more popular, and after it premiered we saw Matt LeBlanc's \"Episodes,\" Ricky Gervais's \"Extras,\" Louie CK's \"Louie,\" Marc Maron's \"Maron,\" Warwick Davis's \"Life's Too Short,\" and others. \"Curb\" also helped to usher the improvisatory approach to dialogue onto the small screen.\n\nDavid's comment on the end of his series is typically wry. \"I will now have the opportunity to finally shed this 'Larry David' persona,\" he said in a statement, \"and become the person God intended me to be -- the thoughtful, kind, caring, considerate human being I was until I got derailed by portraying this malignant character. And so 'Larry David,' I bid you farewell. Your misanthropy will not be missed. And for those of you who would like to get in touch with me, you can reach me at Doctors Without Borders.\"\n\nWHAT TO WATCH THIS WEEK\n\n1. I've always adored Dick Van Dyke, most of all from his 1960s sitcom in which he played a comedy writer and husband to Mary Tyler Moore. He was endearingly human, and a far cry, thankfully, from some of the know-it-all, morally-upright family men we saw on TV in the 1950s. Now CBS is honoring him for his long career, which also included \"Mary Poppins,\" \"Cold Turkey,\" \"Diagnosis: Murder,\" \"Bye Bye Birdie,\" and \"The Comic.\" On Thursday at 9 p.m., the two-hour \"Dick Van Dyke: 98 Years of Magic\" (preview here) will include lots of old footage, recreated TV and movie sets, and guest stars including Jason Alexander, Zachary Levi, Rita Ora, and Weird Al Yankovic. Alas, many of his co-stars -- Moore, Morey Amsterdam, Rose Marie, Carl Reiner -- are gone.\n\n2. On Tuesday, PBS's \"Frontline\" is featuring a new 90-minute documentary called \"Netanyahu, America & the Road to War in Gaza.\" It looks back at the political evolution of Israel's longest-serving prime minister, Benjamin Netanyahu, and it includes accounts from those close to him. The film, at 10 p.m. on GBH 2, tries to provide some context for the war unfolding today. (Preview here.) It will be followed by \"Failure at the Fence,\" a documentary short made in collaboration with the Washington Post that examines the failures that led to Hamas's brutal attack on Israeli civilians.\n\n3. The podcast-based anthology series \"Dr. Death\" returns with an eight-episode season about a charming surgeon known as the \"Miracle Man.\" You guessed it: He's not all he's cracked up to be. An innovator, he catches the attention of a reporter, who winds up getting in over her head with him. He is played by Edgar Ramirez, she is played by Mandy Moore. It premieres Thursday on Peacock. Looks like the pendulum has swung away from the hero doctors of \"ER.\" (Preview here.)\n\n4. NBC is premiering a new sitcom, \"Extended Family,\" on Saturday at 8 p.m. during the holiday season, a fairly dead zone. Created by Mike O'Malley and set in Boston, it's about a couple who have an amicable divorce and continue to live together to raise their kids. (Trailer here.) Comic situations will indeed ensue. The cast features Jon Cryer and Abigail Spencer as the divorced pair, and Donald Faison as her boyfriend. Next year, the show will move to Tuesday nights, where it will stand a better chance.\n\n5. \"Percy Jackson and the Olympians\" is a series adaptation of Rick Riordan's YA fantasy novels about present-day Greek gods. The cast of young 'uns features Walker Scobell, Leah Sava Jeffries, and Aryan Simhadri, and the impressive recurring and guest casts include Megan Mullally, Glynn Turman, Toby Stephens, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Jay Duplass, and the late Lance Reddick. (Trailer here.) It premieres Wednesday on Disney+ and Hulu.",

        "title": "China Committee Chair Gallagher proposes Taiwan deterrence strategy, demands Pentagon classified briefing",
        "body": "EXCLUSIVE: House China Committee Chairman Mike Gallagher is requesting a classified briefing from the Pentagon to discuss ways the United States can work to aid Taiwan in deterrence efforts amid heightened aggression in the region.\n\nGallagher, R-Wis., penned a letter to Deputy Defense Secretary Kathleen Hicks, obtained exclusively by Fox News Digital, in which he says the United States needs to build an \"arsenal of deterrence.\"\n\nTOP REPUBLICAN SOUNDS ALARM ON US TERRITORY BEING 'HIGHLY VULNERABLE' TO CHINESE MISSILES\n\n\"In December 1940, while we were still at peace, President Franklin D. Roosevelt famously called on the United States to be the 'great arsenal of democracy,'\" he writes. \"He said it was the 'purpose of the nation' to build 'with all possible speed, every machine, every arsenal, every factory that we need to manufacture our defense material.'\"\n\nGallagher said Roosevelt's call to provide a \"lifeline\" to allies also helped to \"arm our own military in advance of and through the years of heavy conflict and ultimately win the war.\"\n\n\"Today, the United States finds itself needing to rebuild a different kind of arsenal - an arsenal of deterrence,\" he wrote.\n\nGallagher warns that Chinese President Xi Jinping has \"ordered the Chinese military to be ready to invade Taiwan by 2027.\"\n\nNow, Gallagher is warning that in order to \"prevent war,\" the United States must \"quickly remake an arsenal of deterrence that can arm Taiwan as well as our own forces to allow us to prevail in any conflict in the Indo-Pacific.\"\n\nGallagher, however, said the United States' current \"struggles\" to meet the significant demand for U.S. munitions in Ukraine, and now even in Israel, have revealed \"the fragility of our munitions industrial base.\"\n\nREPUBLICANS DEMAND ANSWERS AFTER TOP BIDEN OFFICIAL INVITED CCP LEADERS TO SENSITIVE NATIONAL SECURITY SITE\n\nThe committee has engaged in war games simulating a conflict with China over Taiwan, which revealed that the United States \"would run out of long-range, precision-guided munitions in less than one week.\"\n\nGallagher warned that the simulation also revealed that the United States would need to fight closer to Chinese defensive fire, and would increase the risk to air and naval assets - as well as the service members who would operate them.\n\n\"With no guarantees that a war in the Indo-Pacific would be limited to weeks or even months, the possibility that we may have to fight for an extended period without the most effective assets in our arsenal is deeply alarming,\" he writes. \"In addition, significant delays in the deliveries of critical missiles to Taiwan, including anti-ship Harpoon missiles, make it unclear whether Taiwan itself will have sufficient weapons to defend itself and repel a Chinese invasion.\"\n\nGallagher added that \"rearming Taiwan after hostilities have commenced, as we did with Ukraine, would be significantly more difficult, if not infeasible.\"\n\n\"Today's challenges must force us to adapt and think outside the box. If delays are preventing vital weapons from being delivered to Taiwan, we must be creative in putting together capabilities - using weapons and assets already in our inventory - that we can promptly deliver to Taiwan,\" he said.\n\nGallagher said if cost and production times are limiting U.S. supplies, he would propose cheaper alternatives that could, instead, be produced quickly, and would complement the more expensive missiles.\n\nJOINT CHIEFS CHAIRMAN SAYS 'WE ALL SHOULD BE' WORRIED ABOUT CHINA POSSIBLY INVADING TAIWAN\n\n\"Two innovative ideas - the 'MacGyver' Harpoons and Powered JDAMs - may offer potential solutions to our problems and help strengthen the arsenal of deterrence at this urgent moment,\" Gallagher proposed.\n\nThe Harpoon missiles, which Gallagher calls \"inventive,\" have been used in Ukraine's fight against Russia.\n\nGallagher said a \"MacGyver\" solution, which is using existing components and older Harpoon missiles already in our inventory, may help get much-needed weapons to Taiwan at a \"significantly lower cost per round.\"\n\n\"The United States currently has hundreds of Harpoon missiles that are being considered for demilitarization, destruction, or long-term stowage. Taiwan may be able to use these missiles with a land-based launch system with only minor modifications,\" Gallagher proposed.\n\n\"Missile launch support structures and Harpoon Ship Command-Launch Control Systems could be taken off decommissioned Navy ships. Communications systems and data links could come from existing Taiwanese systems. Power generators and ground platforms, such as steel plates or Heavy Expanded Mobility Tactical Trucks, could come from either American or Taiwanese stocks,\" he explained.\n\nGallagher also pointed to Joint Direct Attack Munitions, or JDAMs, which he said were used extensively by the United States in both Iraq and Afghanistan.\n\n\"The 'Powered' JDAM - an innovative concept that would allow a standard 500-pound bomb to travel several hundred miles as a cruise missile - could provide a cheaper, near-term solution to complement the more expensive PGMs that take years to build,\" he said, adding that they may be able to attack targets at both land and sea.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nGallagher stressed that \"reviving and rebuilding an arsenal of deterrence will require a generational investment and mobilization.\"\n\n\"At the same time, we must be realistic about how quickly the munitions industrial base will be able to produce our most essential weapons. We must be creative and think outside the box to come up with solutions,\" he said. \"The urgency of the moment requires nothing less.\"\n\nGallagher requested a classified briefing from the Pentagon next month regarding the agency's plans it has to pursue the weapons systems he has proposed.",

        "body": "First Trust Global Portfolios Management Limited (\"FTGPM\") announces the declaration of the quarterly distributions for the following sub-funds of First Trust Global Funds plc,\n\nCollectively the \"Funds\" and each, a \"Fund\".\n\nThe Funds are advised by First Trust Advisors L.P. (\"FTA\").\n\nThe following dates apply to today's distribution declaration:\n\nAbout First Trust Advisors L.P.\n\nFTA is a privately owned US-based financial services firm and is registered as an investment adviser with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. FTA acts as adviser to a range of Irish domiciled UCITS funds under the First Trust Global Funds plc umbrella. The Funds' distributors are FTGPM and First Trust Global Portfolios Limited (\"FT UK\"), an affiliate of FTA. FTGPM is the management company of First Trust Global Funds plc umbrella. FT UK was established in December 2011 as a UK-based and UK Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\") regulated distributor and advisor. FTA, together with its affiliates, has total assets under management or supervision in excess of $201 billion as of at 30 November 2023.

You may not get back all of the money you invest.\n\nMarket risk is the risk that a particular security, or shares of a fund in general may fall in value. Securities are subject to market fluctuations caused by such factors as general economic conditions, political events, regulatory or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, natural disasters or other events could have significant negative impact on a fund.\n\nCurrent market conditions risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of the fund in general, may fall in value due to current market conditions. As a means to fight inflation, the Federal Reserve and certain foreign central banks have raised interest rates and expect to continue to do so, and the Federal Reserve has announced that it intends to reverse previously implemented quantitative easing. Recent and potential future bank failures could result in disruption to the broader banking industry or markets generally and reduce confidence in financial institutions and the economy as a whole, which may also heighten market volatility and reduce liquidity. Ongoing armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine in Europe and among Israel, Hamas and other militant groups in the Middle East, have caused and could continue to cause significant market disruptions and volatility within the markets in Russia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The hostilities and sanctions resulting from those hostilities have and could continue to have a significant impact on certain fund investments as well as fund performance and liquidity. The COVID-19 global pandemic, or any future public health crisis, and the ensuing policies enacted by governments and central banks have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets, negatively impacting global growth prospects. Recent and potential future bank failures could result in disruption to the broader banking industry or markets generally and reduce confidence in financial institutions and the economy as a whole, which may also heighten market volatility and reduce liquidity. There may be tracking difference between a Fund and the relevant underlying index due to the impact of annual Fund management fees. Therefore a Fund's return may not match the return of a Fund's benchmark. A Fund's holdings may be issued by companies concentrated in a particular industry or country. A Fund may invest in small capitalisation and mid capitalisation companies. Such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger, more established companies. As the Funds' investments may be denominated in currencies other than the Funds' currency, an investment in a Fund may expose you to currency risk. A Fund's Net Asset Value (NAV) is likely to have high volatility due to the portfolio composition and/or the index replication technique. As such, potential investors should be aware that a Fund's shares may change in value, and may do so in a volatile fashion; potential investors could lose money by investing in a Fund.\n\nNeither FTGPM nor any of its affiliates guarantees the performance or the future returns of a Fund. There is no guarantee that a Fund will declare dividends. For more details relating to risks of investing in the Funds, please refer to the \"Risk Factors\" section of the Fund's prospectus.\n\nImportant Information\n\nThis financial promotion is issued by FTGPM of Fitzwilliam Hall, Fitzwilliam Place, Dublin 2, D02 T292, Ireland.

        "body": "Netanyahu looked other way as Hamas amassed wealth, NYT reports\n\nStaten Island Borough Hall Menorah Lighting Illuminates and Spreads Light, Energy and Optimism\n\nEdited by: TJVNews.com\n\nThe Council of Jewish Organizations of Staten Island (COJO) convened for the 51st Annual Menorah Lighting held at the Plaza of Staten Island Borough Hall located in the St. George section of the borough. The event hosted by Borough President Vito Fossella attracted elected officials, top brass of the NYPD, community leaders and several hundred children and family. Attendees were treated to Donuts, hot coffee and chocolate and enjoyed musical presentations preformed by the students of the Jewish Foundation School, Staten Island Hebrew Academy and the Hebrew School of Congregation Toras Emes.\n\nMendy Mirocznik, president, COJO, opened the program by calling it to order and by thanking Borough President Vito Fossella for hosting the 51st Annual Menorah Lighting on the plaza of Borough Hall. The plaza emphasized Mirocznik, \"overlooks New York Harbor and Ellis Island a point of arrival for New Americans who came to these shores fleeing persecution with the desire to live in freedom and democracy.\" Mirocznik continued, \"[t]onight, on behalf of COJO the umbrella organization of the Staten Island Jewish community I thank Borough President Fossella for protecting that dream of Jewish Americans by standing up for Israel and taking a tough stand against anti-Semitism.\n\nWe as a community owe special thanks to our Borough President for lighting up Borough Hall in blue lights as a statement of solidarity with Israel when organized pro-Hamas anti-Israel pro-violence agitators gathered at Borough Hall in a hate rally. It took courage and conviction for the Borough President to stand up for peace and what is right and tonight we publicly thank you Mr. Borough President and want you to know that you are a man of action and your strong leadership is deeply appreciated by the community.\"\n\nScott Maurer, CEO and executive Vice-President concurred with Mirocznik and added, \"since that bloody day of terror on October 7, freedom and democracy are under assault. The world is dealing with a situation which has only one of two choices and that is are you on the side of peace, freedom or democracy or are you on the side of terror, death, mayhem and destruction. In this situation people look up to their elected representatives for guidance and we thank Borough President Fossella for taking the stance that Staten Island stands with democracy and freedom and we side with good over evil. Thank you Borough President Fossella for setting the tone in our great borough.\"\n\nBorough President Fossella thanked COJO for sponsoring the annual Borough Hall Menorah Lighting and stated, \"the lights of the Menorah affirm our moral position in standing for good over evil. Tonight, we celebrate the ancient festival of Chanukah where a band of Jewish fighters took on the Assyrian Greeks who believed and practiced the evil of persecution and destruction. The lessons of the flame of the Menorah are relevant today as it was in the days of Judah the Maccabee. Let us resolve to support good and together we will see good triumph over evil and the establishment of a true and lasting peaceful resolution to the battle of evil that Israel finds itself in with the war against Hamas.\"\n\nAlso showing their support was Staten Island District Attorney Michael McMahon; Council Member Kamillah Hanks; and Richmond County Public Administrator Edwina Martin.\n\nMirocznik, then went onto thanking the NYPD who attended the Menorah lighting. Mirocznik quipped, \"we at COJO consider the NYPD to be important partners in all of our programs. And tonight, we are honored that Chief Terence Hurson, executive officer, Patrol Borough Staten Island; Department Chaplain Victor Brown and Department Chaplain Tahir Kukai; Lt. Rafet Awad, commanding officer, Community Affairs, Patrol Borough Staten Island; Inspector Timothy Wilson, Patrol Borough Staten Island; Captain Ron Perez, executive officer, Pct. 122; and Captain Agus Tova, executive officer, Pct. 120; as well as over a dozen police officers attended this evenings Menorah lighting.\" Mirocznik, quipped, \"the NYPD are our modern-day Maccabees.\n\nThey are great officers committed as was the Maccabees in standing up for what is right. They safeguard the rule of law and their focus is that public safety exists for all New Yorkers. By doing so, they deny lawless individuals and criminals from undermining public safety and they guaranty that all people are safe. For this reason alone, we are thankful and we at COJO look forward to our further collaborative efforts with the NYPD in further enhancing public safety and the quality of life for all Staten Islanders.\"\n\nChief Hurson on behalf of the NYPD remarked, 'that we at the NYPD appreciate our great relationship with COJO and its leadership team Mendy Mirocznik and Scott Maurer. COJO thanks to them has an open line of communication with the NYPD. Perhaps one of the greatest helps COJO gives the NYPD is the opportunity to engage the Staten Island community in their various programs and projects which cuts across the diverse communities' resident here. This interaction helps to build community support and confidence with the NYPD which helps public safety. We at the NYPD appreciate this assistance and look forward to continuing this important work.\n\nRabbi Avrohom Biderman, Congregation Oorah; Rabbi Yochanan Ivry, Congregation Toras Emes and Rabbi Aharon Zeev, Aur Torah Sephardic Monyan presided over the Menorah lighting",

        "body": "SNOWBIRDS AND RELOCATERS VA HEALTH CARE\n\nVA has a special process to help veterans who are \"snow birding\" or relocating this year meet their VA health care needs with the minimum of disruption. Veterans enrolled in VA health care can receive the same standard of care while traveling as they would at home, with the proper planning. VA care coordination for traveling/ relocating veterans can be accomplished by contacting the VA traveling/ relocating veteran coordinator. All VA medical centers have this coordinator position to help veterans while traveling. The Danville VA medical center (Illiana VA) has the coordinator position for Central Illinois. Traveling or relocating veterans should contact their local VA patient aligned care team (PACT) or specialty care provider/team of the travel destination, temporary address, dates of travel and contact phone number. The veteran should also provide any specific health care questions. This consult helps register you at the new VA location and provides a handoff to your new facility. Traveling veteran coordinators at both sites will work to ensure your care needs are ordered locally and scheduling occurs timely. The Danville contact number is 1-800-320-8387. When the call is answered, push 0. Then tell the operator at Danville that you wish to speak to the traveling/ relocating veteran coordinator for VA health care.\n\nVA HEALTH CARE INNOVATION AND TECHNOLOGY\n\nThe VA has an Office of Healthcare Innovation and Learning that uses the latest technology to manufacture devices that improve diagnostic capabilities and treatment procedures. VA use of the 3D printer has produced another way to view cancer in the kidney before surgery or treatment, thus pinpointing the exact location, size and shape of the cancer. VA can use the 3D printing scanner to take layered pictures of the tumor and can \"print\" a 3D replica of the kidney. The surgeon can then more accurately guide surgical procedures to match the cancerous tumor and allow the surgeon to plan and execute the surgery in the most efficient and effective manner possible. Not only is the surgery done more efficiently and effectively, but the cost is greatly reduced when using the 3D printer for pre-surgery planning. For instance, The VA estimates that the operating room costs about $80 per minute. Using the 3D model to map out the complicated surgery could save two hours of time or $9,600 -- with a model that cost less than $1,000 to produce. It also means less fatigue for the surgeon and less time under anesthesia for the patient. Visit innovation.va.gov/oam/home.html for a more detailed explanation of both the example given as well as other VA innovations.\n\nARMY-NAVY UNITY AN EXAMPLE FOR AMERICA\n\nThe 2023 annual Army-Navy football game is \"in the books\"! In these times when America is being divided by media, academia, government, religious zealots and a myriad of other factions, the Army-Navy game stands out. There is no greater rivalry than between the military academies! The contest is always hard fought, with team success (not individual accomplishments) the ultimate glory. However, once the game is over, unity takes over. The winning team (this year it is Army) walks to the side of the losing team and together sing that academy's alma mater. Next, they trudge across the field to the victor's side to do the same thing! Then and only then will one side celebrate and the other go off to seek solace in their defeat. If only the politicos, academics, media, religious leaders, and the other groups that have divided America into self-serving niches could set aside their petty differences. America is still the greatest country in the world (maybe in history). It will only prevail if the unified strength of and respect for each of us work toward the common goal of that continued greatness.\n\nQUOTE OF THE DAY\n\nMilitary recruiting has become a topic of great concern as we look across the world filled with hotspots like China/ Taiwan, Israel/Hamas, Ukraine/Russia, and others still under the radar of the news media. A duty that all Americas should embrace is service to and for our country.\n\n\"Ask not what your country can do for you, but what you can do for your country.\" -- John F.

        "title": "New York City educators protest AFT President Randi Weingarten's role in Gaza genocide",
        "body": "facebook icon\n\nOn Wednesday, about 50 New York City educators from both the public K-12 school system and public universities, as well as museum workers and others, rallied in front of the Museum of the City of New York to demand that American Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten call for a ceasefire in Gaza.\n\nWeingarten was a featured speaker at the 40th Anniversary Gala of Citizens Action of New York, an advocacy organization closely associated with the Working Families Party (WFP). The WFP functions as a ballot line for the Democratic Party in New York, supported by the trade union officialdom. Other speakers included leaders of the WFP, Democratic Party-elected state officials and trade union bureaucrats, including Brandon Mancilla, the president of United Auto Workers Region 9A and a member of the Democratic Socialists of America.\n\nWeingarten is a member of the Democratic Party National Committee and a key advocate of the mendacious program of \"Israel's right to defend itself.\" She has not only refused to call for a ceasefire in the genocide of the Israeli Defense Forces of Palestinians in Gaza but has played a key role in ensuing American support for Israel. She was recently appointed by the secretary of Homeland Security, Alejando Mayorkas, to a new Homeland Security Academic Partnership Council which has been formed to repress freedom of speech on university campuses in light of mass student opposition by students to the Gaza genocide.\n\nIn a recent trip to Israel, she attempted to pose as a pacifist who is devastated by the death of both Palestinians and the Israelis who were killed in the attack of October 7. The purpose of her trip was to downplay and relativize the murder of tens of thousands of Palestinians.\n\nAs the World Socialist Web Site noted,\"Despite her crocodile tears for deaths on 'both sides,' Weinstein predictably did not meet with any representatives of Palestinian organizations, including the Palestinian trade union federation, whose call for workers around the world to take industrial action to halt the shipment of weapons to Israel has received widespread support from rank-and-file workers.\"\n\nThe rally against Weingarten took place under conditions in which school authorities all over the United States have taken an aggressive stance, with the support of the state and the Democratic Party, to stifle and illegalize pro-Palestinian dissent by students and educators. Rutgers University in New Jersey and Columbia University in New York have suspended Students for Justice in Palestine clubs on their campuses and students at Hillcrest High School in Queens, New York, have been witch-hunted and smeared as antisemites in the media for protesting against the genocide.\n\nCongress, in a witch-hunting resolution called by far-right New York City Rep. Elise Stefanik, has called on the presidents of Harvard University and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to resign for an alleged failure to condemn \"genocide of the Jews\" just as the president of the University of Pennsylvania was forced to resign by billionaire donors last week.\n\nEducators and others who participated chanted against Weingarten and against Biden's support for the Gaza genocide. Supporters of the Educators Rank-and-File Committee participated in the rally and distributed a leaflet based on the recent WSWS article on Randi Weingarten.\n\nThe World Socialist Web Site interviewed several educators. One retired teacher, who asked that her name not be used, told us:\n\nI am absolutely heartbroken about what's going on, and I want you to know that there are many, many rabbis that come to these demonstrations also and feel the way we do. I am absolutely horrified. We have creeping fascism in the United States. It's just outstandingly frightening and horrifying.\n\nI know there are huge budget cuts coming. I also have been betrayed by my own union about that issue as well. They want to take away our Medicare, which we worked for all our lives, and give us Medicare Advantage, which is a total farce on the whole world of medicine.\n\nAre we going to persuade Randi Weingarten here? Well, we've got to let her see us. We've got to do consciousness raising in every way. She should not be allowed to sleep well at night.\n\nSeveral New York City educators and others spoke to the rally powerfully, opposing the genocide. Among them was Jesse Thomas, a teacher and writer for the World Socialist Web Site who spoke on behalf of the Educators Rank-and-File Safety Committee, whose New York City branch was formed in August 2021 for independent educators' action to stop the spread of COVID-19.\n\nRandi Weingarten is a key player in the machinations of US imperialism, which is an acting complicit partner in the ongoing genocide in Gaza.\n\nThe United States is responding to the massive opposition to the slaughter in Palestine with an increasingly desperate agenda of censorship and repression, branding all opposition to its agenda in the Middle East as antisemitism.\n\nMeanwhile, only last week, a US congressional hearing led by the fascistic Republican Trump supporter Elise Stefanik forced the resignation of the president of the University of Pennsylvania. Stefanik then demanded Harvard President Claudine Gay and MIT President Sally Kornbluth resign.\n\nStefanik is herself a proponent of the \"Great Replacement Theory,\" a xenophobic and racist ideology which stokes white nationalism and has directly motivated far-right shooters in the United States, including in Buffalo, New York, in April 2022\n\nThe Democratic Party is, from top to bottom, completely complicit in the shift to the right of American politics. Faced with the prospect of social opposition to the agenda of war abroad and austerity at home, its leaders, including Joe Biden himself, would rather empower the fascistic right than embolden a popular movement against capitalism.\n\nRandi Weingarten sits on the National Committee of the Democratic Party. She has made multiple visits to Ukraine to work with far-right nationalists to promote the agenda of the Biden administration.\n\nMichael Mulgrew, as has been already pointed out, has not lifted a finger against the genocide, and has, furthermore, actively worked to suppress widespread discussion of the issue within the Department of Education.\n\nIf there is going to be movement to end the genocidal assault in Gaza, it is clear that it must be carried out in direct defiance of the union bureaucrats who are thoroughly tied to the corporate system.\n\nRead moreAmerican Federation of Teachers President Randi Weingarten's trip to Israel: A cover for genocide against Gaza13 December 2023New York City educators hold rally outside UFT headquarters to demand union call for ceasefire in Gaza20 November 2023Political and media establishment slander New York City high school students protesting Gaza genocide30 November 2023Students for Justice in Palestine at Rutgers suspended as part of right-wing witch hunt against opponents of Gaza genocide14 December 2023Contact usRelated TopicsFind out more about these topics:EducationGlobal class struggleNew YorkUnited StatesNorth AmericaStop Israel's genocide in Gaza!War and militarismInterviews and on-the-spot reports",

        "body": "Palestinian Ambassador to the United Nations Riyad Mansour speaks during a United Nations Security Council meeting on Gaza at UN headquarters in New York on December 8, 2023 - Charly TRIBALLEAU\n\nThe United Nations Security Council will vote Monday on a new resolution calling for an \"urgent and sustainable cessation of hostilities\" in Gaza, as Washington exhibits growing impatience with key ally Israel.\n\nThe vote comes days after the United States blocked a previous Security Council resolution that would have called for a \"humanitarian ceasefire\" in the battered Palestinian territory, where Israel continues its deadly strikes in retaliation for Hamas's unprecedented attack on October 7.\n\nBut in the General Assembly, the UN's 193 members voted overwhelmingly for a ceasefire, with 153 in favor -- exceeding the 140 or so countries that have routinely backed resolutions condemning Russia for its invasion of Ukraine.\n\nThe upcoming Security Council resolution was introduced by Arab countries that had come away from last Tuesday's General Assembly vote bolstered by such broad international support, though the latest text's fate remains uncertain.\n\nThe new draft, drawn up by the United Arab Emirates and seen by AFP, calls for an \"urgent and sustainable cessation of hostilities to allow safe and unhindered humanitarian access in the Gaza Strip.\"\n\nIt also affirms support for a two-state solution in the region and \"stresses the importance of unifying the Gaza Strip with the West Bank under the Palestinian Authority.\"\n\nIn a move criticized by Israel and the United States, the draft does not explicitly name Hamas, though it does call for the \"immediate and unconditional release of all hostages\" and condemns \"all indiscriminate attacks against civilians.\"\n\n- 'Protect civilians' -\n\nThe Security Council has faced sharp international opprobrium as it has managed to pass only one resolution on Gaza since the start of the war, in which the 15-member body called for \"humanitarian pauses\" -- after five other resolutions were rejected, including two thanks to American vetoes.\n\nAccording to diplomatic sources, negotiations on the new text continued Sunday in an effort to avoid another impasse, days after US President Joe Biden warned that Israel was at risk of losing international support due to its \"indiscriminate\" bombing of Gaza.\n\n\"The United States should now back those words by acting at the United Nations Security Council to pressure Israel, as well as Palestinian armed groups, to comply with international humanitarian law and protect civilians,\" Louis Charbonneau, the UN director at Human Rights Watch said, telling Washington: \"Don't use vetoes to block resolutions aimed at stopping mass atrocities.\"\n\nSecurity Council resolutions are technically binding, but are often ignored by the countries involved.\n\nAccording to Gaza's Hamas-run health ministry, some 18,800 people, mostly civilians and children, have died since Israeli bombardment began in Gaza in retaliation for Hamas's October 7 attack, which Israel said left 1,139 people dead, also mostly civilians, and saw some 250 people kidnapped.\n\n\"In the face of such atrocities, there is only one moral position, one defensible position: Ceasefire now, ceasefire now, ceasefire now,\" Palestinian UN Ambassador Riyad Mansour said Friday.\n\nBut his Israel counterpart Gilad Erdan countered: \"Calling for a ceasefire now, while (hostages) are still being held, is the most immoral thing to do.\"",

        "title": "HUB Announces Reverse Share Split",
        "body": "TEL AVIV, Israel, Dec. 12, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- via IBN - Hub Cyber Security Ltd. (Nasdaq: HUBC) (\"HUB Security\" or the \"Company\"), a developer of Confidential Computing cybersecurity solutions and services, today announced a 1-for-10 reverse share split of its ordinary shares, no par value per share (the \"Ordinary Shares\"). The reverse share split and corresponding share capital adjustment will become effective at 11:59 p.m. Eastern Time on December 14, 2023. The Ordinary Shares will begin trading on a split-adjusted basis on The Nasdaq Stock Market LLC (\"Nasdaq\") at the open of business on Friday, December 15, 2023, under the existing trading symbol \"HUBC,\" but the Ordinary Shares will trade under a new CUSIP number, M6000J135. HUB Security's outstanding warrants will continue to be traded under the symbols \"HUBCW\" and \"HUBCZ\" and the CUSIP numbers for such warrants will remain unchanged.\n\nAs a result of the reverse share split, every 10 issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares will automatically be converted into one Ordinary Share. No fractional shares will be issued as a result of the reverse share split. Instead, in accordance with the Company's Amended and Restated Articles of Association, all fractional shares will be rounded down to the nearest whole share. The reverse share split affects all shareholders uniformly and will not alter any shareholder's percentage ownership interest in the Company's issued and outstanding Ordinary Shares, except for adjustments that may result from the treatment of fractional shares.\n\nThe reverse share split will also affect the Company's derivative securities, including outstanding notes, options, warrants and restricted share units (collectively, the \"Outstanding Equity Rights\"). Generally, the plans and other documents pertaining to the Outstanding Equity Rights include provisions providing for adjustments in the event of a reverse share split in order to maintain the same economic effect. Specifically, the exercise price and the number of Ordinary Shares issuable pursuant to Outstanding Equity Rights will be adjusted pursuant to the terms of such instruments in connection with the reverse share split.\n\nThe reverse share split is intended to increase the per share trading price of the Ordinary Shares to enable the Company to regain compliance with the minimum bid price requirement in Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1). As previously disclosed, on June 9, 2023, Nasdaq notified the Company that it no longer complies with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5450(a)(1) because for the 30 consecutive business days preceding the date of the notice, the bid price per share of the Ordinary Shares had closed below the $1.00 per share minimum bid price required for continued listing on Nasdaq (the \"Minimum Bid Requirement\"). In accordance with Nasdaq Listing Rule 5810(c)(3)(A), the Company was granted a 180-calendar day compliance period, ending on December 6, 2023, to regain compliance with the Minimum Bid Requirement. The Company did not do so within the time provided and, on December 7, 2023, was notified that the Company's securities were subject to delisting unless the Company timely requested a hearing before the Nasdaq Hearings Panel (the \"Panel\"). The Company filed a request for a hearing before the Panel, which stays any further action by Nasdaq at least until the conclusion of the hearing process. In any event, should the Company evidence compliance with Minimum Bid Requirement for the requisite minimum ten-consecutive business day period prior to or following the hearing, the Company will request that Nasdaq issue a compliance determination, in which case the listing matter will be closed.\n\nAdditional information regarding the reverse share split can be found in the Company's proxy statements furnished to the Securities and Exchange Commission on October 5, 2023 and November 20, 2023.\n\nFor further information or inquiries, please contact: info@hubsecurity.com\n\nHUB Cyber Security Ltd. (\"HUB Security\" or the \"Company\") was established in 2017 by veterans of the elite intelligence units of the Israeli Defense Forces. The Company specializes in unique Cyber Security solutions protecting sensitive commercial and government information. The Company debuted an advanced encrypted computing solution aimed at preventing hostile intrusions at the hardware level while introducing a novel set of data theft prevention solutions.

        "title": "Indiana Mr. Football 2024 early outlook: 12 contenders to watch for state's top award",
        "body": "Now that East Central's Josh Ringer has been named 2023 IndyStar Mr. Football, let's take an early look at the contenders going into next season.\n\nKeep in mind, a lot can happen between now and August. We will revisit this race again in the summer going into the 2024 season. But for now, here is how I see the top Mr. Football contenders. Keep in mind, only the 10 Mr. Football positions winners are eligible to be voted for the big award by members of the Indiana Football Coaches Association.\n\n'A great surprise.' East Central RB Josh Ringer wins 2023 Mr. Football\n\nKeep in mind four of the past six Mr. Football winners were state champions as juniors. Pioneer's Jack Kiser (2018 winner) won back-to-back Class A titles in 2017 and '18. New Palestine record-setting running back Charlie Spegal (2019 winner) won a 5A championship in 2018 and again in '19. Andrean linebacker/running back Drayk Bowen (2022 winner) won a 2A title as a junior and was runner-up as a senior. Ringer, this year's winner, won a 4A title as a junior and again this season as a senior.\n\nThe only Mr. Football winners during that span not to win a state championship as a junior were Center Grove running back Carson Steele (2020 winner) and Gibson Southern quarterback Brady Allen (2021 winner). Steele, however, was a Class 6A runner-up in 2019 and won the 6A championship as a senior. Allen's Gibson Southern team lost in a 3A sectional in 2020, but won the 3A state championship in 2021.\n\nSo, keep that in mind when handicapping the 2024 race. Here are 12 players I think could start at the top of the list:\n\nZackery not only fits into the category of winning a state championship as a junior (the Giants won the Class 6A title over Crown Point), he also won a 4A state basketball championship as a junior as a starting guard.\n\nZackery is one of the top recruits in the country in the 2025 class, rated No. 61 by 247Sports, with offers from Georgia, Michigan, Notre Dame, Ohio State and many others. He caught 53 passes for 823 yards and eight TDs as a junior and had 39 tackles, four interceptions and three fumble recoveries.\n\nZackery could potentially win the Mr. Football position award for wide receiver or defensive back. Ben Davis will have some new pieces around him next year after graduating a special senior class, but you could make a good argument for Zackery as the No. 1 candidate going into August.\n\nWhat else can you do in two seasons? Willis, a two-year starter at quarterback, is 28-0 with back-to-back Class A state titles with the Saints.\n\nLutheran will move up to 2A next year but will be one of the favorites again. Willis has unbelievable career numbers with another year to go. He has completed 68% of his passes for 6,782 yards and 86 TD passes with nine interceptions. It is not out of out of the question Willis could become the eighth quarterback in state history to reach 10,000 career passing yards.\n\nWillis picked up his first Division I offer earlier this month from Central Michigan. The quarterback position award is highly competitive, but Willis should be squarely in the picture.\n\nA third Indy-area player?! I can already hear the screams of \"Indy bias!\" though that is a toothless argument that does not hold up on close inspection in Mr. Football or Mr. Basketball voting ... but that's a column for another day.\n\nPrice is deserving of a long look as well going into next year. Like Zackery, Price already has a 6A state championship under his belt. He starred in the title game with 141 rushing yards and two TDs in a 38-10 win over Crown Point and finished with exactly 1,000 rushing yards and 12 rushing TDs and caught 31 passes for 282 yards and four TDs.\n\nFor his career, Price has 2,281 rushing yards and 27 rushing TDs and 52 catches for 450 receiving yards and five TDs.\n\nThe 6-1, 185-pound Logan, a safety, is one of the state's most prolific athletes and falls into the category of winning a state championship as a junior after Snider capped a 13-1 season with a 33-6 win over Decatur Central in the 5A title game.\n\nLogan, a Vanderbilt baseball recruit, had 95 tackles and six interceptions as a junior (returning four of those interceptions for touchdowns) and was named to the IFCA's Top 50 All-State team. He would appear to be a top contender for the Mr. Football defensive back position award, especially if Zackery is considered a receiver.\n\nLogan is ranked as the No. 51 baseball player in the country in the 2025 class by Prep Baseball Report. He is also a three-star football prospect with an offer from Iowa. Impressive player who belongs in the conversation.\n\nThe 6-3, 220-pound Schott came up one step short of the state finals when Leo lost to NorthWood in the Class 4A semistate in an 11-3 season.\n\nSchott is a big-time player and prospect, rated as a four-star recruit and the No. 2 player in the state behind Zackery by 247Sports. He is also highly productive on both sides of the ball for Lions. Schott, a tight end, caught 36 passes for 743 yards and six touchdowns.\n\nFrom his linebacker position, Schott led the state with 19 sacks and had 32 tackles for loss of his 67 total tackles. He also forced four fumbles and returned an interception for a TD.\n\nSchott, who also plays basketball, has offers from Cincinnati, Indiana, Iowa, Louisville, Miami (Fla.), Michigan State, Minnesota, Purdue, Rutgers and Wisconsin, among others.\n\nThe 6-5, 230-pound Shanklin, a defensive end, had a massive junior season with 66 tackles (50 solo), including 17 for a loss, and five sacks as he earned IFCA Top 50 All-State honors.\n\nShanklin might be one of the only defensive ends in the state to also handle the punting and kickoff duties for his team. The four-star prospect is one of the highest-rated recruits in the state with offers from Notre Dame (he is visiting again this weekend), Duke. Michigan, USC and many others.\n\nShanklin is poised for a big senior season and should be one of the top contenders for the Mr. Football position award winner at defensive line.\n\nThe 6-1, 190-pound Hilton is one of the most dynamic receivers in the state, coming off a season that saw him catch 46 passes for 836 yards and 10 touchdowns. He also threw a touchdown pass and returned a kickoff for a touchdown, averaging 33.5 yards on six returns.\n\nHilton, the son of former Colts' star TY Hilton, has nearly two dozen offers but has a top six of Florida International (his father's alma mater), Kentucky, Miami (Fla.), Missouri, Ole Miss and Wisconsin.\n\nZionsville will have to make improvement from last year's 3-7 season for Hilton to have a chance to make a real run at the top award.\n\nCarroll made a run to the Class 6A state finals in 2022, and I thought we might see the Chargers back again this season. But Carroll lost to Warsaw in the first round of the sectional and finished 7-3.\n\nSullivan, who committed to Iowa on Saturday over offers from Illinois, Michigan State, Minnesota and others, passed for 1,508 yards and 18 touchdowns as a senior and ran for 406 yards and five TDs. For his career, Sullivan has 3,798 passing yards and 45 TD passes and 598 rushing yards and 14 rushing TDs, along with two TD catches.\n\nLike others on this list, a tournament run is probably necessary for Sullivan to put his name firmly in the mix. He was the only quarterback on the 6A Junior IFCA All-State team.\n\nThe 6-1, 270-pound Thacker missed six games due to injury at the start of the season but still put up big numbers with 60 tackles, seven sacks, 19 tackles for loss, two fumble recoveries and one caused fumble in eight games for the Class 4A regional champions.\n\nThacker, a defensive tackle with offers from Marshall, Tennessee, West Virginia and several Mid-American Conference schools, already has 252 career tackles, including 75 ½ for a loss.\n\nThere will be plenty of competition for the defensive line Mr. Football position award, though Thacker should be right there in the mix.\n\nThe 6-2, 180-pound Hall, a three-sport athlete who also competes in track and basketball, is coming off a massive junior season that saw him catch 69 passes for 1,055 yards and six touchdowns and average 42.2 yards on nine kickoff returns\n\nHall, who has offers from Indiana, Akron, Ball State and Miami of Ohio, has 80 catches for 1,317 yards and 11 TD receptions. He and Hilton were the only receivers on the 6A Junior All-Star team by the IFCA.\n\nFishers was 7-4 last season but has not been able to break though and win the sectional since 2017, losing to Hamilton Southeastern each of the past three seasons.\n\nThe 6-2, 190-pound Ehrlich had a strong junior season with a tough finish in a 38-10 loss to Ben Davis in the Class 6A state championship. He threw for 2,453 yards and 27 touchdowns with nine interceptions and rushed for 342 yards and 10 TDs.\n\nEhrlich, who has offers from Central Michigan, Miami (Ohio) and Toledo, was named to the IFCA 6A Junior All-State team as an athlete. He has the advantage of having played on a 6A state finalist and will be on a team that should again contend for a spot in the state finals.\n\nThe 6-foot, 190-pound Geske was the state's leading passer in the junior class, throwing for 3,084 yards and 40 touchdowns with 10 interceptions.\n\nGeske has 4,865 passing yards and 64 passing TDs for his career. His top receiver and running both return last year for a 6-5 team that was one point away from winning a Class 4A sectional championship.\n\nJalen Bonds, Cathedral: Rushed for 1,194 yards and 12 TDs as a junior.\n\nTyrone Burrus, Warren Central: Defensive end had 15 tackles for loss and six sacks as a junior. Offers from Indiana, Iowa, Purdue and others.\n\nMalachi Walden, Tri-West: Passed for 1,650 yards and 18 TDs and 1,797 rushing yards and 22 TDs.\n\nMariyon Dye, Elkhart: Defensive end is one of top prospects in state with offers from Georgia, Michigan, USC and many others.\n\nMason Alexander, Hamilton Southeastern: Alexander is a big-time playmaker in the defensive secondary for the Royals with 39 tackles and three interceptions as a junior.\n\nJamari Pearson, Fort North Side: All-purpose talent has offers from Indiana, Louisville and others.\n\nCam Herron, Warren Central: Could contend for offensive line Mr. Football award.\n\nCameron Gorin, Hamilton Southeastern: Same as Herron. Gorin will be in mix for offensive line position award.\n\nLarry Ellison, Crown Point: Ran for 1,865 yards and 26 TDs as team reached 6A state finals.\n\nNizyi Davis, Lawrence Central: Serious athlete at tight end. Coming back from injury but caught 29 passes for 410 yards and one TD as a junior with offers from Indiana, Purdue, Wisconsin and more.\n\nDavion Chandler, Lawrence North: Another outstanding junior receiver. Had 40 catches for 779 yards and 13 TDs.",

        "body": "John le Carré authored some of the greatest espionage and thriller novels. Among those adapted for the big screen, the following are the best.\n\nSummary Le Carré's novels are frequently adapted into movies due to their believability and his own experience in the intelligence field. The best movies based on Le Carré's novels are praised for their faithfulness to the source material and exceptional cast performances. These movies provide a mix of education and entertainment, exploring political commentary and adding a touch of excitement to the spy genre. MOVIEWEB VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nMany authors dream of seeing their novels getting adapted into movies, but a few others get calls from studios quite often. The late David John Moore Cornwell -- better known by his nom de plume John le Carré -- was one such novelist. It's not by luck or favoritism that le Carré's work was frequently selected above those of his peers. He had worked for both MI6 and MI5, hence his spy fiction tales always felt more believable. Occasionally, he veered into other genres, and even when he did so, the end-product was still good.\n\nLe Carré can also be categorized among a small group of authors whose books have never been poorly adapted. Each of the films has been received well by fans and critics, but a few of them are more recommendable because they either replicate the book's magic or add a little spice to make the story even better. Additionally, each of these big screen projects has a great cast, hence the acting is superb. And even among the cream, a few are flawless while others needed a little polishing in some areas.\n\nHere are the best movies based on John le Carré novels, ranked.\n\n10 The Little Drama Girl (1984)\n\nThe Little Drama Girl wastes no time in introducing audiences to the quagmire at hand. The Mossad is figuring out a way to capture the Palestine Liberal Organization (PLO) bomber, Khalil, and after much deliberation, the higher-ups decide to turn the American actress, Charlie (Diane Keaton), into a double agent. Because she has built a reputation for her anti-Zionist (opposition against the formation of the state of Israel) beliefs, the Israeli spy agency forces her to infiltrate the PLO and destroy it from within.\n\nWhy It's Good\n\nThe film is more educative than entertaining, and for most of its running time, it provides plenty of little-known details about the dynamics of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. The dialogue is designed to offer political commentary, and it is rich enough to make audiences understand why both parties feel aggrieved.\n\nAway from the discourse, Keaton bosses the proceedings like she normally does. However, the movie slightly flounders by being too book-accurate. Some individuals are very similar in mannerisms and principles, hence they could have been merged into composite characters instead of being presented as they were on the pages. Rent on Prime Video\n\n9 The Looking Glass War (1969)\n\nHollywood is full of underrated Cold War films, and The Looking Glass War is undoubtedly one of them. In it, MI6 receives intel that East Germany is constructing a dangerous missile. Given the events that transpired during the Cuban Missile Crisis, everyone becomes paranoid, so the agency recruits a Polish man named Leiser (Christopher Jones) to go and find out if it's true. Leiser desperately needs British citizenship because his lover lives in England, so he is promised what he craves if he completes the mission.\n\nWhy It's Good\n\nLe Carré once described The Looking Glass War as one of the most accurate movies about his spy career, but director Frank Pierson switches all the gritty spy mechanics for the more fun stuff. For example, the MI6 department handling the case is very incompetent in the book, while in the movie, it handles matters fairly well.\n\nAdditionally, the protagonist looks a bit James Bond-ish here. He is a good-looking womanizer with a great fashion sense, and because of this approach, there is an overall feel-good atmosphere in the film. Still, it's hard not to question how a flashy man like Leiser can do undercover work in East Germany -- a country where members of the public were heavily watched by the stasi (state police). Stream on Prime Video\n\n8 The Deadly Affair (1967)\n\nThere are a few notable differences between The Deadly Affair and le Carré's first novel, Call for the Dead. The protagonist's name, for instance, was changed from George Smiley to Charles Dobbs (because Paramount had acquired the rights to the character after he appeared in The Spy Who Came in From the Cold). His wife is also shown to be having an affair. Everything else is the same, with the story revolving around Dobbs (James Mason) as he investigates the death of a British foreign office official with the belief that the man's wife is responsible.\n\nWhy It's Good\n\nThe decision to include complicated love arcs was a wise one, and the adaptation is more enjoyable because of it, appealing to both spy buffs and fans of tense and dark romance thrillers. The idiocy that comes with love is well explored here, so much so that Dobbs even allows his cheating wife to spend his money with her lover.\n\nThere is a pretty wild twist at the very end, too, one that serves as a perfect pay-off to all the hard investigative work that was put in. Additionally, the catchy bossa nova soundtrack fits well within every scene. The only major flaw is the unsophisticated dialogue, which comes off as cheesy at times. Stream on Fubo\n\n7 The Russia House (1990)\n\nThe Russia House is yet another romance and espionage cocktail that grips viewers throughout its two-hour running time. In it, British publishing mogul Barley Blair (Sean Connery) chances upon a manuscript detailing the Soviet Union's nuclear pans. He passes it on to the authorities, and within a short time, he receives an assignment from MI6, tasking him to investigate its editor, Katya Orlova (Michelle Pfeiffer). While spying on her, the two end up falling in love.\n\nWhy It's Better\n\nHaving spent the better part of his career playing the world's most famous spy, Connery handles the material with ease. He speaks almost in the exact manner that the elderly James Bond did in Never Say Never Again, and makes the flirting sessions believable. Pfeiffer, on the other hand, seems like she is still playing the lovely Elviria from Scarface. Every man wants her character, and she is glad to bask in the attention.\n\nApart from that, The Russia House's cinematography feels very authentic. This is mainly because it was shot in the story's exacting setting, becoming the first American blockbuster to be substantially filmed on location in Russia. Stream on MGM+\n\n6 The Tailor of Panama (2001)\n\nThe Tailor of Panama is one of the rare adaptations written by the author. Instead of simply handing over the tale's rights to Columbia Pictures, le Carré wrote the screenplay, which revolves around Andy Osnard (Pierce Brosnan), an MI6 spy who tasks highly sought-after Panama tailor Harry Pendel (Geoffrey Rush) with extracting information from his elite clients. The film also marked Daniel Radcliffe's debut as Harry's son, Mark.\n\nWhy It's Better\n\nLike Connery, Brosnan was okay with getting typecast as a spy shortly after hanging up his 007 tux. Unlike The Russia House, The Trailor of Panama has a stronger Bond aura to it. The colorful cinematography mirrors that of Die Another Die and Tomorrow Never Dies, while Brosnan is still in his element as a lothario, hedonist, and competitive spy. Even his pickup lines are precise and Bond-like. \"Full-on affair. Now! Let's see how we like it. If we don't, we chuck it in!\" -- these are the words he tells a woman he is eyeing in the film. Rent on AppleTV\n\n5 Our Kind of Traitor (2016)\n\nMeeting with a money launderer for the Russian mafia is one of the things a vacationer would least expect to happen, but that's how fate plays out for English professor Perry MacKendrick (Ewan McGregor) while he and his wife are enjoying Morocco's sun and sites. The man known as Dima fears for his life because the mob has a new trigger-happy boss, so he deliberately dumps critical information on Perry and instructs him to give it to MI6 once he is back. For this, he hopes to go into witness protection.\n\nWhy It's Better\n\nAs is the case in the books, many John le Carré adaptations rely on the \"average Joe\" formula to deliver compelling narratives, but Our Kind of Traitor's civilian-turned-hero impresses more because he is more proactive and courageous. Whether it's killing an assassin or making a quick escape, Perry does it all without hesitation. Supporting actors like Naomie Harris and Damian Lewis also nail each of their scenes, and in what is a well-appreciated Hitchcockian casting decision, le Carré himself makes a cameo as a ticket collector. Stream on Freevee\n\n4 The Constant Gardener (2005) the constant gardener Release Date August 31, 2005 Director Fernando Meirelles Cast Ralph Fiennes , Rachel Weisz , Hubert Koundé , Danny Huston , Daniele Harford , Packson Ngugi Rating R Runtime 129 Main Genre Drama\n\nIn The Constant Gardener, British diplomat and horticulturist Justin Quayle (played by Ralph Fiennes) relocates to Kenya with his wife after being transferred to the East African country. Within no time, she gets murdered, forcing Justin to turn every block to find her killer. Soon, he learns that the murder might be connected to a new dangerous drug that he and his wife were trying to get off the market.\n\nWhy It's Better\n\nThe film has a compelling plot, first tricking audiences into thinking that the tragedy might be connected to Third World crime only for a twist to link everything to Big Pharma. Numerous flashbacks help make the story easier to understand. Questions regarding how the couple met and how they got to share ideologies regarding medicine are all answered.\n\nAdditionally, the cinematography is stunning, partially because of the sun-baked Kenyan landscapes and majorly because Fernando Meirelles is the director. In City of God, Meirelles demonstrated what proper visuals ought to look like and he does so again here. Rent on AppleTV\n\n3 A Most Wanted Man (2014) a most wanted man Release Date July 25, 2014 Director Anton Corbijn Cast Grigoriy Dobrygin , Philip Seymour Hoffman , Homayoun Ershadi , Mehdi Dehbi , Neil Malik Abdullah , Nina Hoss Rating R Runtime 121 Main Genre Thriller\n\nAfter the 9/11 attacks, le Carré began shifting from Cold War tales to terrorism tales, so the novel, and eventually the movie, A Most Wanted Man, were born. The story centers around German intelligence officer Günther Bachmann (Philip Seymour Hoffman) as he investigates a Chechen political refugee, whom he believes is linked to Al-Qaeda.\n\nWhy It's Perfect\n\nBachmann was Hoffman's final leading role before his untimely death, and while watching the film, it doesn't take too long to recognize his brilliance. From his gaze to how he channels his character's frustration whenever something goes wrong, Hoffman never drops off form.\n\nBesides that, there is endless creativity when it comes to spycraft. Whether it is USB sticks being passed around in cigar packs or two agents pretending to smooch while watching their targets, a lot of effort goes into making everything appear normal. Stream on Tubi\n\n2 The Spy Who Came in From the Cold (1965)\n\nThe \"one last job\" trope has been abused at this point, but back in the '60s, it was still fresh, so it worked well for The Spy Who Came in From the Cold. In it, MI6 agent Alec Leamas (Richard Burton) is given one last assignment before retirement. He is ordered to pretend to be a disgruntled drunk to attract East German interest and gain information about some of his captured coworkers. As expected, his mission leads to other deadly revelations.\n\nWhy It's Perfect\n\nThe Spy Who Came in From the Cold is widely recognized as one of the most realistic spy movies because it doesn't romanticize the profession. It highlights the emotional toll that normally weighs down on the agents, especially after working for years. In most of the scenes, Leamas' eyes appear heavy with sleep, and moving from one section to the next is laborious for him.\n\nColor had already been introduced to cinema by 1965, but director Martin Ritt chose to incorporate a black-and-white color scheme, a choice that helped accentuate the gloomy atmosphere. And in a crucial scene where a character makes the long-awaited crossing from East to West Germany, the camera offers a lengthy birds-eye-view of the entire boundary as a sign that oppression has been overcome. Consequently, the spy flick was nominated for Best Art Direction at the Oscars. Burton also received a nomination for Best Actor. Rent on AppleTV\n\n1 Tinker Taylor Soldier Spy (2011) Tinker, Tailor, Soldier, Spy Release Date September 16, 2011 Director Tomas Alfredson Cast Mark Strong , John Hurt , Zoltán Mucsi , Péter Kálloy Molnár , Ilona Kassai , Imre Csuja Rating R Runtime 127 Main Genre Drama\n\nTinker Tailor Soldier Spy had already been adapted into a gripping miniseries in the '70s, starring Sir Alec Guinness, so Studio Canal's decision to give the novel the big screen treatment was a big gamble. Thankfully, the end-product turned out better than most people expected. The film follows veteran spy George Smiley (Gary Oldman), who is recalled from retirement to patch up \"leaking taps\" after a Hungarian general mysteriously dies just before he passes crucial information to MI6.\n\nWhy It's Perfect\n\nThe movie is one long game of \"Guess who is the mole?\" and by not providing the answer too quickly, it manages to grab the viewer's attention until the dying minutes. Several characters seem like the likely culprit, and as is normally the case, the guilty party turns out to be the one who looks the most innocent.\n\nTinker Tailor Soldier Spy is also the kind of film that's packed with harbingers. In one scene, a waiter's drop of sweat falls on the table, a sign of bad things to come. Not to forget the well-developed characters, all of whom are evil but likable, thanks to great work by the likes of Tom Hardy, Colin Firth, and Benedict Cumberbatch. Stream on Starz",

        "title": "Bob Good prepares for fight as new hard-right leader after controversial moves inside House GOP | News Channel 3-12",
        "body": "By Melanie Zanona, Alayna Treene and Manu Raju, CNN\n\n(CNN) -- During last week's chairmanship election for the far-right House Freedom Caucus, Rep. Bob Good was directly pressed by board members on perhaps one of his most controversial moves inside the GOP: backing Ron DeSantis over Donald Trump in the 2024 Republican presidential primary.\n\nGood's response, according to a source familiar with the conversation, was that he would ultimately get behind Trump if he is the GOP presidential nominee, but explained he thought it was better to have a candidate who could serve eight more years instead of four, which is why he threw his early support behind the young Florida governor.\n\nThe rabble-rousing Virginia Republican was ultimately elected this week to serve as the head of the House Freedom Caucus, a high-profile role that will put him front-and-center of some of next year's biggest funding fights and in direct conflict with the new speaker, Mike Johnson, who will be forced to negotiate with Democrats.\n\nBut the exchange about DeSantis, which has not been previously reported, suggests there was at least some skepticism about Good taking the reins of the House Freedom Caucus, which is home to some of the former president's staunchest allies. His endorsement could also be a liability for Good's own reelection race, where he is now facing a pro-Trump Republican challenger using his DeSantis endorsement against him.\n\nAnd Trump is not the only powerful Republican whom Good has crossed this year: Good was among the small band of hardliners who voted to oust Kevin McCarthy as speaker in October, plunging the House into weeks of chaos and dysfunction as Republicans fought bitterly among themselves to find a new speaker, ultimately settling on Johnson.\n\nDespite making his share of enemies inside the GOP, Good said he is ready to hold Johnson's feet to the fire and has no regrets about his decision to boot McCarthy and support DeSantis. The 58-year-old conservative said he has no fears about the GOP primary challenge he is now facing because of it.\n\n\"He's the most outstanding governor that I've seen in my lifetime. And I think that he gives us the best chance to win the battleground states,\" Good told CNN. \"The polls don't indicate that most Republicans are joining me with that. But we'll see in Iowa. ... I will be enthusiastically behind either one of them as the nominee. But I stand behind my endorsement of Gov. DeSantis.\"\n\nAsked whether he's concerned about Trump potentially coming after him in a primary, Good said: \"I respect President Trump and I look forward to having a great working relationship with him in whatever capacity,\" adding that he would back Trump if he became the nominee and called him \"the best president of my lifetime.\"\n\nNot everyone is happy about Good being elevated to the top spot of the influential conservative group. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who is close to both McCarthy and Trump and was booted from the Freedom Caucus earlier this year, called it a \"major mistake\" and \"controversial\" move.\n\n\"A lot of the House Freedom Fund donors are upset about it. They're not fans of him,\" Greene told CNN. \"It's also very problematic for a future Trump administration. He's a turncoat. Basically, a traitor. Had no loyalty to President Trump, who had endorsed him, supported him, when he ran for Congress in 2020.\"\n\nGreene also said she has met with John McGuire, the Republican candidate seeking to challenge Good, and said she might \"possibly\" get involved in the primary.\n\n\"I've heard great things about him,\" Greene said of Good's challenger. \"I do know that he's a big supporter of President Trump. Which I like.\"\n\nThe majority of the Freedom Caucus was able to look past Good's support for DeSantis and have no concerns about his ability to work with Trump, perhaps because several members themselves have endorsed other candidates. Republicans told CNN they believe his advocacy for fiscal conservatism, a no-holds-barred approach and clashes with leadership are in line with the group's core mission and see him as a good fit to lead them in their next chapter.\n\n\"Bob is exceptionally smart. He loves conservatism. He will do what it takes to move the Freedom Caucus forward,\" said Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, a Freedom Caucus member who has endorsed Nikki Haley.\n\nNorman also dismissed concerns about Good's decision-making on DeSantis or McCarthy. \"We're all free thinkers. We're all independent contractors,\" he said.\n\nYet many Republicans flatly blame the Freedom Caucus as a whole for paralyzing their party's agenda and using brazen tactics to try to get their way.\n\n\"They're mostly to blame,\" Rep. Carlos Gimenez, a Florida Republican, said of the Freedom Caucus' role in stalling the GOP agenda this year.\n\nBut as Good steps into his new role, he will have to quiet concerns - both in the Freedom Caucus and back in his district - about his DeSantis and McCarthy moves, while also leading the group through a series of high-profile fights related to federal spending and the potential impeachment of President Joe Biden, both top priorities for the group.\n\n\"I think there's concerns at every layer,\" one Freedom Caucus member told CNN, citing Good's DeSantis endorsement as an example. \"There is a concern: Can the organization continue to be effective? Does the brand shift, take on the character of Bob, or does Bob take on the character of the historical organization? That's not 100% aligned in the view of a lot of people.\"\n\nGood said the faction will be ready to battle to force their way on federal spending ahead of a government shutdown fight early next year - and as senators try to strike a deal on immigration to free up aid to Ukraine and Israel, saying he's pressing Johnson to not move off the hard-line immigration bill that passed the House earlier this year since \"that's our position.\"\n\n\"We want to work with the speaker to accomplish the things that Republicans ran on, that Republicans stand for,\" Good said, calling on the GOP to unite behind deeper spending cuts. \"And we're struggling with our own conference with a commitment to doing that.\"\n\nBut Good's selection as Freedom Caucus chief was not without drama: Rep. Warren Davidson of Ohio told his colleagues in a letter that he would not seek reelection to the group's board after it recommended Good to be its next chairman, saying he was concerned Good would \"impair\" their main objectives, according to a copy of the letter obtained by CNN and first reported by Axios.\n\nDavidson declined to comment when asked by CNN about the letter.\n\nGood, a former county supervisor who has championed staunchly conservative fiscal and social views, was first elected to Congress in 2020 after picking up a Trump endorsement and toppling fellow GOP Rep. Denver Riggleman, a Freedom Caucus member who came under fire for officiating a same-sex marriage.\n\nNow, Good is staring down a primary threat of his own: McGuire, a Virginia state representative and former Navy Seal who has made Trump front and center in his campaign.\n\nA source close to McGuire said he was not planning to run for the seat, but was encouraged by people in the state to launch a bid after Good helped boot McCarthy from the speakership in October.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, McGuire said \"the calls to challenge Bob Good have become too great to ignore.\"\n\n\"People from all over Virginia's 5th District feel that Bob's actions in joining with Pelosi, AOC, and other Democrats to take out a Republican speaker was completely self-serving and could not have come at a worse time for our elections here in Virginia this past November,\" McGuire said. \"Throw on top of it that Bob endorsed DeSantis against Trump the day Trump was indicted ... It all adds up to Bob is unfit to serve.\"\n\nSome of Good's allies, however, believe it will be difficult for McGuire to paint Good as out of step with the conservative base. And they also argue Good will boost his fundraising capabilities with his new high-profile role.\n\n\"You're not going to get to the right of Bob Good,\" said retiring GOP Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado, a Freedom Caucus member who also joined the effort to oust McCarthy and has not endorsed Trump.\n\nGood has defended his push to boot McCarthy, arguing the speaker did not show a serious commitment to cutting federal spending. But Good also had a personal grudge toward McCarthy, complaining in private meetings that the California Republican didn't call to congratulate him after he won his 2020 primary race.\n\nSo far, Good has shown less animosity toward Johnson, who is more conservative than his predecessor. But Good and the Freedom Caucus have been fuming over some of Johnson's recent moves, including a decision to include an extension of a controversial government surveillance program in an annual defense bill.\n\nGood says he is promising to keep the pressure on Johnson, calling the GOP leadership's handling of the defense bill \"an abysmal failure.\"\n\n\"If Speaker Johnson does the things that Republicans across the country elected us to do, we will be his greatest advocates, his greatest partners, his greatest cheerleaders,\" Good told CNN after the House voted on the defense bill. \"If we do things like what we did today, then the Freedom Caucus will absolutely be a problem with an agenda that's consistent with what we just did today.\"\n\nSome people in Trump world were surprised that the Freedom Caucus, traditionally very pro-Trump, selected Good as their leader, advisers and sources close to the former president tell CNN.\n\nTrump and his close aides were annoyed with Good when he announced in May that he was endorsing DeSantis, Trump's leading rival at the time. They viewed his backing of the Florida governor as \"disloyal,\" one of Trump's advisers told CNN shortly after Good's endorsement, arguing that the former president \"helped get him elected\" by endorsing Good's congressional bid in 2020.\n\nNow, with Good's rise to prominence as the leader of the Freedom Caucus, some of Trump's allies are questioning whether they'll continue to view the ultra-conservative group as a collection of members they can rely on.\n\nHowever, other members of Trump's inner circle downplayed that the group's selection of Good has any real impact, and asserted that few people in Trumpworld are paying attention to the Freedom Caucus' activities.\n\n\"No one has mentioned Bob Good at all. It's an insignificant thing and it's not even on our radar,\" a second Trump campaign adviser told CNN. \"DeSantis isn't going to be the nominee, so it's a moot point for us,\" they added.\n\nTrump, both while president and now as a candidate, has traditionally relied more on his relationships with individual members of the Freedom Caucus than he has on the Freedom Caucus as a group, though he's always viewed the caucus as a collection of \"his people,\" as one Trump ally characterized it.\n\nIn the intervew, Good had nothing but praise for Trump.\n\n\"As you've heard me say many times, I'm a big fan of President Trump,\" Good told CNN. \"I supported Trump enthusiastically in '16 and '20. I think he's the best president of my lifetime. If he's our nominee I will enthusiastically support him again.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "body": "By Melanie Zanona, Alayna Treene and Manu Raju, CNN\n\n(CNN) -- During last week's chairmanship election for the far-right House Freedom Caucus, Rep. Bob Good was directly pressed by board members on perhaps one of his most controversial moves inside the GOP: backing Ron DeSantis over Donald Trump in the 2024 Republican presidential primary.\n\nGood's response, according to a source familiar with the conversation, was that he would ultimately get behind Trump if he is the GOP presidential nominee, but explained he thought it was better to have a candidate who could serve eight more years instead of four, which is why he threw his early support behind the young Florida governor.\n\nThe rabble-rousing Virginia Republican was ultimately elected this week to serve as the head of the House Freedom Caucus, a high-profile role that will put him front-and-center of some of next year's biggest funding fights and in direct conflict with the new speaker, Mike Johnson, who will be forced to negotiate with Democrats.\n\nBut the exchange about DeSantis, which has not been previously reported, suggests there was at least some skepticism about Good taking the reins of the House Freedom Caucus, which is home to some of the former president's staunchest allies. His endorsement could also be a liability for Good's own reelection race, where he is now facing a pro-Trump Republican challenger using his DeSantis endorsement against him.\n\nAnd Trump is not the only powerful Republican whom Good has crossed this year: Good was among the small band of hardliners who voted to oust Kevin McCarthy as speaker in October, plunging the House into weeks of chaos and dysfunction as Republicans fought bitterly among themselves to find a new speaker, ultimately settling on Johnson.\n\nDespite making his share of enemies inside the GOP, Good said he is ready to hold Johnson's feet to the fire and has no regrets about his decision to boot McCarthy and support DeSantis. The 58-year-old conservative said he has no fears about the GOP primary challenge he is now facing because of it.\n\n\"He's the most outstanding governor that I've seen in my lifetime. And I think that he gives us the best chance to win the battleground states,\" Good told CNN. \"The polls don't indicate that most Republicans are joining me with that. But we'll see in Iowa. ... I will be enthusiastically behind either one of them as the nominee. But I stand behind my endorsement of Gov. DeSantis.\"\n\nAsked whether he's concerned about Trump potentially coming after him in a primary, Good said: \"I respect President Trump and I look forward to having a great working relationship with him in whatever capacity,\" adding that he would back Trump if he became the nominee and called him \"the best president of my lifetime.\"\n\nNot everyone is happy about Good being elevated to the top spot of the influential conservative group. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who is close to both McCarthy and Trump and was booted from the Freedom Caucus earlier this year, called it a \"major mistake\" and \"controversial\" move.\n\n\"A lot of the House Freedom Fund donors are upset about it. They're not fans of him,\" Greene told CNN. \"It's also very problematic for a future Trump administration. He's a turncoat. Basically, a traitor. Had no loyalty to President Trump, who had endorsed him, supported him, when he ran for Congress in 2020.\"\n\nGreene also said she has met with John McGuire, the Republican candidate seeking to challenge Good, and said she might \"possibly\" get involved in the primary.\n\n\"I've heard great things about him,\" Greene said of Good's challenger. \"I do know that he's a big supporter of President Trump. Which I like.\"\n\nThe majority of the Freedom Caucus was able to look past Good's support for DeSantis and have no concerns about his ability to work with Trump, perhaps because several members themselves have endorsed other candidates. Republicans told CNN they believe his advocacy for fiscal conservatism, a no-holds-barred approach and clashes with leadership are in line with the group's core mission and see him as a good fit to lead them in their next chapter.\n\n\"Bob is exceptionally smart. He loves conservatism. He will do what it takes to move the Freedom Caucus forward,\" said Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, a Freedom Caucus member who has endorsed Nikki Haley.\n\nNorman also dismissed concerns about Good's decision-making on DeSantis or McCarthy. \"We're all free thinkers. We're all independent contractors,\" he said.\n\nYet many Republicans flatly blame the Freedom Caucus as a whole for paralyzing their party's agenda and using brazen tactics to try to get their way.\n\n\"They're mostly to blame,\" Rep. Carlos Gimenez, a Florida Republican, said of the Freedom Caucus' role in stalling the GOP agenda this year.\n\nBut as Good steps into his new role, he will have to quiet concerns - both in the Freedom Caucus and back in his district - about his DeSantis and McCarthy moves, while also leading the group through a series of high-profile fights related to federal spending and the potential impeachment of President Joe Biden, both top priorities for the group.\n\n\"I think there's concerns at every layer,\" one Freedom Caucus member told CNN, citing Good's DeSantis endorsement as an example. \"There is a concern: Can the organization continue to be effective? Does the brand shift, take on the character of Bob, or does Bob take on the character of the historical organization? That's not 100% aligned in the view of a lot of people.\"\n\nGood said the faction will be ready to battle to force their way on federal spending ahead of a government shutdown fight early next year - and as senators try to strike a deal on immigration to free up aid to Ukraine and Israel, saying he's pressing Johnson to not move off the hard-line immigration bill that passed the House earlier this year since \"that's our position.\"\n\n\"We want to work with the speaker to accomplish the things that Republicans ran on, that Republicans stand for,\" Good said, calling on the GOP to unite behind deeper spending cuts. \"And we're struggling with our own conference with a commitment to doing that.\"\n\nBut Good's selection as Freedom Caucus chief was not without drama: Rep. Warren Davidson of Ohio told his colleagues in a letter that he would not seek reelection to the group's board after it recommended Good to be its next chairman, saying he was concerned Good would \"impair\" their main objectives, according to a copy of the letter obtained by CNN and first reported by Axios.\n\nDavidson declined to comment when asked by CNN about the letter.\n\nGood, a former county supervisor who has championed staunchly conservative fiscal and social views, was first elected to Congress in 2020 after picking up a Trump endorsement and toppling fellow GOP Rep. Denver Riggleman, a Freedom Caucus member who came under fire for officiating a same-sex marriage.\n\nNow, Good is staring down a primary threat of his own: McGuire, a Virginia state representative and former Navy Seal who has made Trump front and center in his campaign.\n\nA source close to McGuire said he was not planning to run for the seat, but was encouraged by people in the state to launch a bid after Good helped boot McCarthy from the speakership in October.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, McGuire said \"the calls to challenge Bob Good have become too great to ignore.\"\n\n\"People from all over Virginia's 5th District feel that Bob's actions in joining with Pelosi, AOC, and other Democrats to take out a Republican speaker was completely self-serving and could not have come at a worse time for our elections here in Virginia this past November,\" McGuire said. \"Throw on top of it that Bob endorsed DeSantis against Trump the day Trump was indicted ... It all adds up to Bob is unfit to serve.\"\n\nSome of Good's allies, however, believe it will be difficult for McGuire to paint Good as out of step with the conservative base. And they also argue Good will boost his fundraising capabilities with his new high-profile role.\n\n\"You're not going to get to the right of Bob Good,\" said retiring GOP Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado, a Freedom Caucus member who also joined the effort to oust McCarthy and has not endorsed Trump.\n\nGood has defended his push to boot McCarthy, arguing the speaker did not show a serious commitment to cutting federal spending. But Good also had a personal grudge toward McCarthy, complaining in private meetings that the California Republican didn't call to congratulate him after he won his 2020 primary race.\n\nSo far, Good has shown less animosity toward Johnson, who is more conservative than his predecessor. But Good and the Freedom Caucus have been fuming over some of Johnson's recent moves, including a decision to include an extension of a controversial government surveillance program in an annual defense bill.\n\nGood says he is promising to keep the pressure on Johnson, calling the GOP leadership's handling of the defense bill \"an abysmal failure.\"\n\n\"If Speaker Johnson does the things that Republicans across the country elected us to do, we will be his greatest advocates, his greatest partners, his greatest cheerleaders,\" Good told CNN after the House voted on the defense bill. \"If we do things like what we did today, then the Freedom Caucus will absolutely be a problem with an agenda that's consistent with what we just did today.\"\n\nSome people in Trump world were surprised that the Freedom Caucus, traditionally very pro-Trump, selected Good as their leader, advisers and sources close to the former president tell CNN.\n\nTrump and his close aides were annoyed with Good when he announced in May that he was endorsing DeSantis, Trump's leading rival at the time. They viewed his backing of the Florida governor as \"disloyal,\" one of Trump's advisers told CNN shortly after Good's endorsement, arguing that the former president \"helped get him elected\" by endorsing Good's congressional bid in 2020.\n\nNow, with Good's rise to prominence as the leader of the Freedom Caucus, some of Trump's allies are questioning whether they'll continue to view the ultra-conservative group as a collection of members they can rely on.\n\nHowever, other members of Trump's inner circle downplayed that the group's selection of Good has any real impact, and asserted that few people in Trumpworld are paying attention to the Freedom Caucus' activities.\n\n\"No one has mentioned Bob Good at all. It's an insignificant thing and it's not even on our radar,\" a second Trump campaign adviser told CNN. \"DeSantis isn't going to be the nominee, so it's a moot point for us,\" they added.\n\nTrump, both while president and now as a candidate, has traditionally relied more on his relationships with individual members of the Freedom Caucus than he has on the Freedom Caucus as a group, though he's always viewed the caucus as a collection of \"his people,\" as one Trump ally characterized it.\n\nIn the intervew, Good had nothing but praise for Trump.\n\n\"As you've heard me say many times, I'm a big fan of President Trump,\" Good told CNN. \"I supported Trump enthusiastically in '16 and '20. I think he's the best president of my lifetime. If he's our nominee I will enthusiastically support him again.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "body": "MUNCIE, Ind. - The end of year data is giving economy watchers plenty cause for holiday cheer.\n\nConsumer spending remains robust, and the early holiday sales suggests a record year, even after controlling for inflation. That seems reasonable given that household wealth is at a record level and unemployment is lower than it has been since the Nixon administration. Last week's job reports showed record employment as part of three years of sustained employment gains.\n\nInflation-adjusted wages have been growing for several months now with the biggest gains accruing the lowest-paid 80 percent of workers. Credit card debt is back down to 2019 levels, and there is nothing apparent on the consumption side that would risk derailing this period of growth.\n\nStrong demand for goods and services means strong corporate profits, which has resulted in record-high stock market indices. The stock market is a poor predictor of future economic performance, but better returns further boost consumer spending, particularly among retirees.\n\nBusiness capital investment is strong but not spectacular, suggesting less volatile expectations by firms. Business expansion is broad and sustained since late 2020, but it is not at a feverish level. New business formation has been proceeding at record levels for close to three years now. Here in Indiana, applications for new businesses are up 84 percent since COVID, with the most recent quarter near the all-time record.\n\nFueling much of this optimistic behavior is the steadily retreating inflation. We are now 18 months past peak inflation, and the broadest measures of price change have dropped 16 out of the last 18 months. The measure of personal consumption inflation growth is actually negative over the past two quarters. This is caused by the Federal Reserve reducing the money supply, most visibly through increases to their policy interest rates.\n\nWe have now been through seven months without a rate increase, and the Fed again held rates steady this week. It now seems almost certain the Fed will begin easing rates within two quarters, and they have indicated that we should expect at least three cuts in 2024. Financial markets are anticipating this, so mortgage interest rates have declined for seven straight weeks. This will improve the home buying season this spring.\n\nAll of this is good news, but I am looking more closely at labor productivity. Typically, as labor markets tighten, productivity growth slows, or even declines. The reason for this is fairly self-evident. When unemployment rates are high, it is the least productive firms that make cuts. This boosts production per worker, since only the strong businesses survive. When unemployment rates are very low, it because of strong demand. This strong demand for goods and services means a number of less productive firms can still hang on. This slows productivity growth.\n\nFor the first 18 months after COVID, this pattern almost perfectly repeated itself. Big job losses meant that only the best firms survived, so productivity growth soared. As we got back to normal, we saw productivity growth dip into negative territory as expected. But, for close to two years productivity growth has slowly improved. Last quarter it stood at 2.4 percent annualized rate. This is good at any time, but when it happens when the unemployment rate is near a 50-year low, it signals something else is happening.\n\nNo one is sure about what might be happening to boost worker productivity, but the are several possibilities. First, is the cyclical nature of technology. We can go through long periods of buying and installing new technology without much effect on the productivity data. It took desktop computers almost two decades to really affect overall efficiency. We might just be in a cycle where investments in digital technology for the last decade is boosting our efficiency at making goods and delivering services.\n\nA second feature might be the expansion of remote work. For many occupations, the ability to work from home offers substantial productivity improvements. Randomized control trials from before COVID identified substantially more efficient workplaces when workers could voluntarily remain at home. There is significant evidence that businesses and workers are working out the kinks in technology and processes to make themselves more efficient.\n\nA third aspect of the economy is simple demographic change. Millennials are now the largest generation at work in the economy. These workers are entering the most productive years of their work lives, giving the U.S. a large bump in average worker productivity. This alone is large enough to boost overall economic performance.\n\nMost likely, all of these factors are working to make the current economy grow faster than we've seen so far in the 21st century. The blistering pace of GDP growth last quarter, topping 5.2 percent, suggests this is not a transient effect. Given a smooth patch of economic fundamentals, the U.S. might be heading for a period more reminiscent of the late 1990s than anything we've seen since. That would be most welcoming, but there are things that could derail a period of peaceful prosperity.\n\nWar and the rumor of war casts a durable shadow on the peaceful production and exchange of goods and services. As bad as war is, it is preferable to a peace that comes from victory by evil. Two major and several smaller wars pit liberal democracies against the purest of evil. Should Ukraine or Israel lose their wars, it would be disastrous for the U.S. economy. And that is if we are fortunate. Evil lurks in Tehran as well as other capitals. A major conflict will derail our economy, but failure in these wars would be worse.\n\nThe U.S. has a high debt, and though it has receded in recent quarters, remains uncomfortably high. The U.S. has weathered high debt for a lot longer than most economists thought possible a generation ago. However, higher borrowing costs threaten our ability to spend money where it is needed, and forces difficult spending and tax choices. A remedy to our deficit problem will require substantial political compromise on both spending and taxes. With the incentive structure in Congress fully condemning compromise, we should not expect action anytime soon.\n\nThis climate of opposition comes at the behest of voters. We elected these folks they reflect our values or lack thereof. We will pay for their folly, but don't blame them.

        "title": "SNL Team, Kate McKinnon & Billie Eilish End Year on Holiday High Note",
        "body": "Host Kate McKinnon, musical guest Billie Eilish & the SNL team ended the year on a high note with a holiday episode overflowing with cheer.\n\nWe had high hopes when we learned that Saturday Night Live alum, actor & comedian Kate McKinnon and musical guest Billie Eilish would be taking the stages of Studio 8H to help the SNL fam end the year on a strong note before shuffling off to their midseason break (returning on January 20th). And what we ended up with was a warm, fuzzy, funny, and slightly twisted stocking filled with some sketches representing some of the best work of the season so far. Here's a rundown of why this weekend's show worked and the sketches/moments that made my personal highlight reel.\n\nSo What Worked? The \"Christmas Awards\" cold open was a fun opener that hit on a ton of personal levels - and I'm not surprised SNL stayed away from topical stuff this week after the bullet they dodged with last week's opening. \"ABBA Christmas\" took a hot second to work for me, but once it did? How can you not love Bowen Yang joining McKinnon, Kristen Wiig & Maya Rudolph in the Swedish supergroup? \"North Pole News: Killer Whale Attack\" worked because Mikey Day is great as any kind of \"live reporter\" while McKinnon got a chance to channel some Robert Shaw from Jaws in this one.\n\n\"Weekend Update\" continues to do no wrong while setting a new bar when it comes to bringing the comedic pain (more on that in a minute), while Ego Nwodim's Rich Auntie with No Kids offered some wonderfully spot-on commentary on the holiday season (while jockeying for Michael Che's job). \"Gifts from Mom\" gave us way too many holiday PTSD flashbacks to guilt-ridden relatives, while \"Cinema Classics\" missed the mark in its messaging, relying way too much on McKinnon and Chloe Troast to carry the writing across the finish line. And as someone who's run and been part of more than his fair share of \"Secret Santas\" holiday exchanges, \"Yankee Swap\" worked because it played upon the idea that we're more looking for a present that will make us feel like a kid than actually help us in our adult lives. That's just a fancy way of saying that I would go with the dancing Santa Claus, too.\n\nHighlights: There was a mix of five sketches that ranged all over the thematic map - ranging from the sweet to the twisted and just about every rung on the ladder in between. But the one thing that they all have in common is that they were my personal highlights from an episode that was strong from top to bottom - here's why:\n\nMonologue: From seeing McKinnon get teary-eyed on the livestream just before taking the stage to McKinnon's performance with Rudolph & Wiig, the monologue was funny, touching, and heartfelt.\n\n\"Tampon Farm\": In terms of SNL sketch \"music videos,\" this McKinnon, Eilish, Wiig, Rudolph & Paula Pell-starring sketch worked on a whole number of levels - you could turn the sketch into a very dangerous drinking game trying to match up all the point being hit in less than three minutes. And bonus props for yet another reminder of what a great voice McKinnon has (and how easily she sounds like Melissa Ethridge).\n\n\"Whiskers R We\": We were hoping for another McKinnon/Eilish sketch team-up, and this was exactly the kind of oddly sweet holiday heartstring-tugger we wanted. I especially appreciated how the cats and a slew of great name puns didn't overshadow the personal story between Barbara DeDrew (McKinnon) and Paw-bree Hep-Purrn (Eilish). I thought they might go in the direction of them having crushes on each other, but the mother/daughter implication was a much better call.\n\n\"Pongo\": Whether it was a Sarah Sherman-penned sketch or not, it has the comedian's brand of humor all over it - and I loved it. Parents (Day & Sherman) buy a special kind of \"pet\" for the family (McKinnon, Chloe Fineman & Andrew Dismukes) that addresses their concerns that maybe the family isn't ready for a real pet. So there's Pongo - the pet that has no openings, so there's no feeding or cleaning to worry about, and barking isn't an issue. Also? Pongo can't die. Pongo really likes being a part of your family. Pongo doesn't appreciate anyone trying to get rid of Pongo. I think you can appreciate what a nasty turn something like can take - and bonus props to Sherman, who does as excellent of a job playing the role of the person being victimized by the \"horror\" as she does playing the \"horror\" in past sketches.\n\n\"Weekend Update: Christmas Joke Swap 2023\": How the f**k will Weekend Update duo Colin Jost & Che raise the bar next year after this year's \"Christmas Joke Swap\"? If you haven't seen it, then I won't even attempt to summarize the righteously awkward joke punches the two threw at each other this year. From Che bringing out a \"special guest\" to \"assist\" Jost with his jokes to Che being made to stop a joke that has him suggesting that the Israel/Palestine conflict just needs more Jesus Christ in it, this year's edition was a masterclass in quality cringe humor.\n\nThank You, Billie Eilish: I was going to love whatever it was that Eilish offered us on Saturday Night - but I was really hoping for a Christmas cover. Eilish didn't disappoint - reminding us all of the beauty & grace in her voice. The cover of \"Have Yourself a Merry Little Christmas\" should be a permanent fixture in every holiday playlist (unless you don't celebrate Christmas - which is understandable):",

        "title": "Bob Good prepares for battle as new hard-right leader but faces blowback for backing DeSantis over Trump - KTVZ",
        "body": "(CNN) -- During last week's chairmanship election for the far-right House Freedom Caucus, Rep. Bob Good was directly pressed by board members on perhaps one of his most controversial moves inside the GOP: backing Ron DeSantis over Donald Trump in the 2024 Republican presidential primary.\n\nGood's response, according to a source familiar with the conversation, was that he would ultimately get behind Trump if he is the GOP presidential nominee, but explained he thought it was better to have a candidate who could serve eight more years instead of four, which is why he threw his early support behind the young Florida governor.\n\nThe rabble-rousing Virginia Republican was ultimately elected this week to serve as the head of the House Freedom Caucus, a high-profile role that will put him front-and-center of some of next year's biggest funding fights and in direct conflict with the new speaker, Mike Johnson, who will be forced to negotiate with Democrats.\n\nBut the exchange about DeSantis, which has not been previously reported, suggests there was at least some skepticism about Good taking the reins of the House Freedom Caucus, which is home to some of the former president's staunchest allies. His endorsement could also be a liability for Good's own reelection race, where he is now facing a pro-Trump Republican challenger using his DeSantis endorsement against him.\n\nAnd Trump is not the only powerful Republican whom Good has crossed this year: Good was among the small band of hardliners who voted to oust Kevin McCarthy as speaker in October, plunging the House into weeks of chaos and dysfunction as Republicans fought bitterly among themselves to find a new speaker, ultimately settling on Johnson.\n\nDespite making his share of enemies inside the GOP, Good said he is ready to hold Johnson's feet to the fire and has no regrets about his decision to boot McCarthy and support DeSantis. The 58-year-old conservative said he has no fears about the GOP primary challenge he is now facing because of it.\n\n\"He's the most outstanding governor that I've seen in my lifetime. And I think that he gives us the best chance to win the battleground states,\" Good told CNN. \"The polls don't indicate that most Republicans are joining me with that. But we'll see in Iowa. ... I will be enthusiastically behind either one of them as the nominee. But I stand behind my endorsement of Gov. DeSantis.\"\n\nAsked whether he's concerned about Trump potentially coming after him in a primary, Good said: \"I respect President Trump and I look forward to having a great working relationship with him in whatever capacity,\" adding that he would back Trump if he became the nominee and called him \"the best president of my lifetime.\"\n\nNot everyone is happy about Good being elevated to the top spot of the influential conservative group. Rep. Marjorie Taylor Greene of Georgia, who is close to both McCarthy and Trump and was booted from the Freedom Caucus earlier this year, called it a \"major mistake\" and \"controversial\" move.\n\n\"A lot of the House Freedom Fund donors are upset about it. They're not fans of him,\" Greene told CNN. \"It's also very problematic for a future Trump administration. He's a turncoat. Basically, a traitor. Had no loyalty to President Trump, who had endorsed him, supported him, when he ran for Congress in 2020.\"\n\nGreene also said she has met with the Republican candidate seeking to challenge Good, and said she might \"possibly\" get involved in the primary.\n\n\"I've heard great things about him,\" Greene said of Good's challenger. \"I do know that he's a big supporter of President Trump. Which I like.\"\n\nThe majority of the Freedom Caucus was able to look past Good's support for DeSantis and have no concerns about his ability to work with Trump, perhaps because several members themselves have endorsed other candidates. Republicans told CNN they believe his advocacy for fiscal conservatism, a no-holds-barred approach and clashes with leadership are in line with the group's core mission and see him as a good fit to lead them in their next chapter.\n\n\"Bob is exceptionally smart. He loves conservatism. He will do what it takes to move the Freedom Caucus forward,\" said Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina, a Freedom Caucus member who has endorsed Nikki Haley.\n\nNorman also dismissed concerns about Good's decision-making on DeSantis or McCarthy. \"We're all free thinkers. We're all independent contractors,\" he said.\n\nYet many Republicans flatly blame the Freedom Caucus as a whole for paralyzing their party's agenda and using brazen tactics to try to get their way.\n\n\"They're mostly to blame,\" Rep. Carlos Gimenez, a Florida Republican, said of the Freedom Caucus' role in stalling the GOP agenda this year.\n\nBut as Good steps into his new role, he will have to quiet concerns - both in the Freedom Caucus and back in his district - about his DeSantis and McCarthy moves, while also leading the group through a series of high-profile fights related to federal spending and the potential impeachment of President Joe Biden, both top priorities for the group.\n\n\"I think there's concerns at every layer,\" one Freedom Caucus member told CNN, citing Good's DeSantis endorsement as an example. \"There is a concern: Can the organization continue to be effective? Does the brand shift, take on the character of Bob, or does Bob take on the character of the historical organization? That's not 100% aligned in the view of a lot of people.\"\n\nGood said the faction will be ready to battle to force their way on federal spending ahead of a government shutdown fight early next year - and as senators try to strike a deal on immigration to free up aid to Ukraine and Israel, saying he's pressing Johnson to not move off the hard-line immigration bill that passed the House earlier this year since \"that's our position.\"\n\n\"We want to work with the speaker to accomplish the things that Republicans ran on, that Republicans stand for,\" Good said, calling on the GOP to unite behind deeper spending cuts. \"And we're struggling with our own conference with a commitment to doing that.\"\n\nBut Good's selection as Freedom Caucus chief was not without drama: Rep. Warren Davidson of Ohio told his colleagues in a letter that he would not seek reelection to the group's board after it recommended Good to be its next chairman, saying he was concerned Good would \"impair\" their main objectives, according to a copy of the letter obtained by CNN and first reported by Axios.\n\nDavidson declined to comment when asked by CNN about the letter.\n\nGood, a former county supervisor who has championed staunchly conservative fiscal and social views, was first elected to Congress in 2020 after picking up a Trump endorsement and toppling fellow GOP Rep. Denver Riggleman, a Freedom Caucus member who came under fire for officiating a same-sex marriage.\n\nNow, Good is staring down a primary threat of his own: John McGuire, a Virginia state representative and former Navy Seal who has made Trump front and center in his campaign.\n\nA source close to McGuire said he was not planning to run for the seat, but was encouraged by people in the state to launch a bid after Good helped boot McCarthy from the speakership in October.\n\nIn a statement to CNN, McGuire said \"the calls to challenge Bob Good have become too great to ignore.\"\n\n\"People from all over Virginia's 5th District feel that Bob's actions in joining with Pelosi, AOC, and other Democrats to take out a Republican speaker was completely self-serving and could not have come at a worse time for our elections here in Virginia this past November,\" McGuire said. \"Throw on top of it that Bob endorsed DeSantis against Trump the day Trump was indicted ... It all adds up to Bob is unfit to serve.\"\n\nSome of Good's allies, however, believe it will be difficult for McGuire to paint Good as out of step with the conservative base. And they also argue Good will boost his fundraising capabilities with his new high-profile role.\n\n\"You're not going to get to the right of Bob Good,\" said retiring GOP Rep. Ken Buck of Colorado, a Freedom Caucus member who also joined the effort to oust McCarthy and has not endorsed Trump.\n\nGood has defended his push to boot McCarthy, arguing the speaker did not show a serious commitment to cutting federal spending. But Good also had a personal grudge toward McCarthy, complaining in private meetings that the California Republican didn't call to congratulate him after he won his 2020 primary race.\n\nSo far, Good has shown less animosity toward Johnson, who is more conservative than his predecessor. But Good and the Freedom Caucus have been fuming over some of Johnson's recent moves, including a decision to include an extension of a controversial government surveillance program in an annual defense bill.\n\nGood says he is promising to keep the pressure on Johnson, calling the GOP leadership's handling of the defense bill \"an abysmal failure.\"\n\nGood is promising to hold Johnson's feet to the fire, calling the GOP leadership's handling of the bill \"an abysmal failure.\"\n\n\"If Speaker Johnson does the things that Republicans across the country elected us to do, we will be his greatest advocates, his greatest partners, his greatest cheerleaders,\" Good told CNN after the House voted on the defense bill. \"If we do things like what we did today, then the Freedom Caucus will absolutely be a problem with an agenda that's consistent with what we just did today.\"\n\nSome people in Trump world were surprised that the Freedom Caucus, traditionally very pro-Trump, selected Good as their leader, advisers and sources close to the former president tell CNN.\n\nTrump and his close aides were annoyed with Good when he announced in May that he was endorsing DeSantis, Trump's leading rival at the time. They viewed his backing of the Florida governor as \"disloyal,\" one of Trump's advisers told CNN shortly after Good's endorsement, arguing that the former president \"helped get him elected\" by endorsing Good's congressional bid in 2020.\n\nNow, with Good's rise to prominence as the leader of the Freedom Caucus, some of Trump's allies are questioning whether they'll continue to view the ultra-conservative group as a collection of members they can rely on.\n\nHowever, other members of Trump's inner circle downplayed that the group's selection of Good has any real impact, and asserted that few people in Trumpworld are paying attention to the Freedom Caucus' activities.\n\n\"No one has mentioned Bob Good at all. It's an insignificant thing and it's not even on our radar,\" a second Trump campaign adviser told CNN. \"DeSantis isn't going to be the nominee, so it's a moot point for us,\" they added.\n\nTrump, both while president and now as a candidate, has traditionally relied more on his relationships with individual members of the Freedom Caucus than he has on the Freedom Caucus as a group, though he's always viewed the caucus as a collection of \"his people,\" as one Trump ally characterized it.\n\nIn the intervew, Good had nothing but praise for Trump.\n\n\"As you've heard me say many times, I'm a big fan of President Trump,\" Good told CNN. \"I supported Trump enthusiastically in '16 and '20. I think he's the best president of my lifetime. If he's our nominee I will enthusiastically support him again.\"\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "body": "On 3 November 1950, the General Assembly adopted resolution 377 A (V), which was given the title \"Uniting for Peace\". The adoption of this resolution came as a response to the strategy of the Union of Soviet Socialist Republics (USSR) to block any determination by the Security Council on measures to be taken in order to protect the Republic of Korea against the aggression launched against it by military forces from North Korea. At the initial stage of this armed conflict, in June 1950, the Security Council had been able to recommend to the Members of the United Nations to \"furnish such assistance to the Republic of Korea as may be necessary to repel the armed attack and to restore international peace and security in the area\" (resolution 83 (1950) of 27 June 1950). The resolution could be passed because the USSR, at that time, boycotted the meetings of the Security Council with the aim of obtaining the allocation of the permanent Chinese seat to the communist Government in Beijing. It assumed that in its absence the Security Council would not be able to discharge its functions since Article 27, paragraph 3, of the Charter provides that substantive resolutions of the Security Council require an affirmative vote of nine members \"including the concurring votes of the permanent members\". The majority of the members of the Security Council, however, were of the view that absence from the meeting room could not prevent the key organ of the United Nations from acting validly, a view that was later endorsed by the International Court of Justice (ICJ) (Legal Consequences for States of the Continued Presence of South Africa in Namibia (South West Africa) notwithstanding Security Council Resolution 276 (1970), Advisory Opinion, I.C.J Reports 1971, p. 16, at para. 22). Given that its protests remained fruitless, the USSR sent again, as from August 1950, a delegation to the meetings of the Council which cast a negative vote on a United States draft resolution condemning the continued defiance of the United Nations by the North Korean authorities. In order to overcome this impasse, the United States, under the leadership of its Foreign Secretary Dean Acheson, succeeded in persuading the General Assembly that it should claim for itself a subsidiary responsibility with regard to international peace and security, as enunciated by Article 14 of the Charter. The result of these efforts was resolution 377 A (V).\n\nThe most important part of resolution 377 A (V) is section A which states that where the Security Council, because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, fails to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security, the General Assembly shall seize itself of the matter. Procedural and substantive steps are suggested. First of all, if the Assembly is not in session, it may meet in emergency special session at the request of the Security Council or of a majority of its own members. Second, such a session shall be convened with a view to making appropriate recommendations for \"collective measures...including the use of armed force when necessary\". As also the language of the resolution clearly reveals, the General Assembly can never be a full substitute for the Security Council in this area. Accordingly, only \"recommendations\" are mentioned, i.e., pronouncements devoid of any binding legal force. Additionally, resolution 377 A (V) establishes two auxiliary bodies, a Peace Observation Commission, which existed until 1960, and a Collective Measures Committee, which had a short life of only two years. None of these bodies has played any role of major significance.\n\nAlthough the General Assembly did not attempt to arrogate to itself powers akin to those rooted in Chapter VII of the Charter, it stands to reason that originally resolution 377 A (V) was hardly reconcilable with the Charter. Articles 11 and 12 establish unequivocally the primacy of the Security Council with regard to all matters relating to international peace and security. As far as procedure is concerned, Article 12, paragraph 1, stipulates that while the Council is exercising its function in respect of any dispute or situation, \"the General Assembly shall not make any recommendation with regard to that dispute or situation\". On the other hand, where \"action\" seems to be necessary, the General Assembly is enjoined to refer the matter to the Council (Article 11, paragraph 2). This configuration, however, was hard to uphold. Politically, it is definitely quite unwise to keep the General Assembly on the sidelines when a major conflict erupts. Almost as a logical consequence, Article 11, paragraph 2, and Article 12, paragraph 1, have suffered an erosion process of which resolution 377 A (V) constitutes only one element among many others. In its Advisory Opinion on the Legal Consequences of the Construction of a Wall in the Occupied Palestinian Territory, the ICJ has formally confirmed that the prohibition of simultaneous action has been superseded by practice (I.C.J. Reports 2004, p. 136, at paras. 27-28).\n\nTo date, ten emergency special sessions have been convened. The first one took place on the occasion of the 1956 war between Israel and Egypt and the British-French attack on the Suez Canal zone; the tenth emergency special session, dealing with the Israeli occupation of Palestinian territory, started in 1997 and has not yet come to its end. (It was adjourned by resolution ES-10/16 of 17 November 2006, para. 13, and can at any time be resumed upon request by Member States.)\n\nAccording to political criteria, different patterns can be distinguished. If the Security Council is unanimous in requesting such a session, the harmony between the two main organs of the United Nations is not disturbed. The crisis in Lebanon prompted the Security Council in 1958 to convene an emergency special session of the General Assembly (resolution 129 (1958) of 7 August 1958). It did so without mentioning explicitly resolution 377 A (V), and one may indeed have doubts as to whether this was a case of application of that resolution since there was no lack of unanimity of the permanent members. The situation in Lebanon was referred to the General Assembly because the Security Council had no solution to offer. The second situation is characterized by a vote of a majority of the members of the Security Council against the opposition of some other members, including permanent members. In such instances, the veto does not operate since referral to the General Assembly is considered to constitute a procedural determination and hence not subject to such blocking power. Understandably, the first emergency special session was called by the Security Council against the resistance of France and the United Kingdom (resolution 119 (1956) of 31 October 1956). In the Hungarian crisis, which unfolded almost at the same time, the roles were distributed differently, with only the USSR opposing the motion (resolution 120 (1956) of 4 November 1956). Similar configurations could be observed with regard to the holding of emergency special sessions on the Republic of the Congo (resolution 157 (1960) of 17 September 1960: opposition of Poland and the USSR), on the conflict between India and Pakistan on account of East Pakistan/Bangladesh (resolution 303 (1971) of 6 December 1971: abstention of France, Poland, the USSR and the United Kingdom), and on Afghanistan (resolution 462 (1980) of 9 January 1980: opposition of the German Democratic Republic and the USSR). Total emancipation from the Security Council is reached where the Secretary-General convenes an emergency special meeting at the request of a United Nations Member acting with the support of a majority in the General Assembly. The seventh emergency special session on Palestine (1980-1982) was in fact initiated by Senegal, the eighth emergency special session on Namibia (1981) goes back to a request by Zimbabwe, and the tenth emergency special session was solicited by Qatar as the Chair of the Group of Arab States at the United Nations. It stands to reason that in such instances the overwhelming weight of third world countries can manifest itself to its full extent. Urgent matters may also be dealt with during the ordinary sessions of the General Assembly if the Security Council takes no action owing to the negative vote of a permanent member. (A prominent example is provided by General Assembly resolution 41/38 of 20 November 1986, dealing with the aerial and naval attack on Libya by the United States.)\n\nAlthough the shifting of responsibilities to the General Assembly may not be consistent with the original intentions of the drafters of the Charter, it is today fully accepted that emergency special sessions have become an integral part of the legal order of the United Nations. On the other hand, the need for the holding of such sessions has considerably decreased, as for many years the General Assembly is frequently in session much beyond the usual period from September to December. On a regular basis sessions are resumed in plenary meetings for short periods in the months before the start of a new session in September. In the early years, Member States were not represented in New York throughout the year. Today, urgent matters can be dealt with by the General Assembly at short notice. As already pointed out, the tenth emergency special session, which started in 1997, has not yet been concluded and has for many years operated alongside the regular sessions of the General Assembly. (In its Advisory Opinion on the Wall case (I.C.J. Reports 2004, p. 152, at para. 34), the ICJ did not raise any objections against that practice.) It has become a special forum to deliberate on the policies and practices of Israel with regard to the occupied Palestinian territories, totally changing its character from a meeting convened to discuss urgent matters to a permanent, but intermittent conference on a topic of paramount interest to the international community.\n\nObviously, the crucial element of resolution 377 A (V) was the affirmation that the General Assembly may, if deemed appropriate by it, recommend collective action, including the use of force. In this core sense, the resolution has been implemented only once in the Korean crisis. By resolution 498 (V) of 1 February 1951 it made a finding to the effect that the People's Republic of China had engaged in aggression in Korea (para. 1) and \"call[ed] upon all States and authorities to continue to lend every assistance to the United Nations action in Korea\" (para. 4), which of course meant military assistance. The resolution does not explicitly refer to the Uniting for Peace resolution, but it emphasizes that the Security Council, \"because of lack of unanimity of the permanent members, has failed to exercise its primary responsibility for the maintenance of international peace and security\" (preamble). Thus, the wording is exactly copied from resolution 377 A (V). The establishment of the peacekeeping operation First United Nations Emergency Force (UNEF I) by resolution 1000 (ES-I) of 5 November 1956 with a view to monitoring the frontline between Israel and Egypt does not come within the same category since UNEF I had no combat function to discharge but was meant to neutralize the conflict solely by its presence between the two opposing parties in accordance with the \"classic\" peacekeeping concept which was given birth on that occasion. On the whole, it is not easy to draw the demarcation line between \"measures\" contemplated specifically by resolution 377 A (V) and other measures which the General Assembly may recommend within the framework of its general mandate without any hindrance. According to the Advisory Opinion of the ICJ in the Certain Expenses case, the exclusive powers of the Security Council are confined to coercive or enforcement action (Certain Expenses of the United Nations (Article 17, paragraph 2, of the Charter), Advisory Opinion of 20 July 1962, I.C.J. Reports 1962, p. 151, at 164), but the ICJ did not discuss specifically the impact of resolution 377 A (V). In this connection, the question arises, inter alia, how the imposition of an embargo, as formerly practiced by the General Assembly in a sustained fashion to the detriment of South Africa, is to be characterized (this practice commenced with resolution 41/35 F of 10 November 1986). In any event, it has become a regular feature of resolutions of the General Assembly with regard to armed conflicts to call upon the parties to desist from any hostilities and to withdraw their troops to their own territories (see, for instance, resolution 62/243 of 14 March 2008, on the situation in the occupied territories of Azerbaijan). Such requests are not considered as requiring any particular legitimation under resolution 377 A (V).\n\nResolution 377 A (V) has a potential that could subvert the well-equilibrated balance of power within the United Nations, a potential that is not disclosed in a recent description of the role and authority of the General Assembly (see resolution 60/286 of 8 September 2006, annex, para. 1). But it would actually be used against the Security Council only in case of general dissatisfaction with the policies of the permanent members. Notwithstanding their sheer numerical superiority, the many Members of the United Nations are much too weak to attempt to challenge the decisions made at the Security Council. Any application of Uniting for Peace with a view to taking enforcement action would at least need the support of one of the permanent members. To date, resolution 498 (V) of 1951 remains the only example of a situation where the General Assembly, at that time under dominating Western influence, recommended taking such action, notwithstanding the firm resistance of a permanent member.\n\nRelated Materials\n\nA.

        "body": "On a vibrant Saturday night, the United Palace in New York City played host to the captivating Symphony of the Stars charity concert, orchestrated by United Hatzalah, Israel's national volunteer-based emergency medical service (EMS). Dedicated to delivering swift and free emergency medical first response across Israel, the organization witnessed an impressive turnout of 3,500 attendees, raising a substantial $250,000 in support of its lifesaving mission.\n\nThe concert featured a stellar lineup of Jewish music luminaries, including Benny Friedman, Ishay Ribo, Avraham Fried, Shulem Lemmer, and Mordechai Shapiro, who left an enduring impression on the audience. A harmonious fusion of diverse musical styles united the singers in creating a tapestry that resonated across varied audiences, resulting in an extraordinary and unforgettable night. Avrumy Jordan, Major Gifts Officer for the Tristate Area at United Hatzalah, expressed his enthusiasm, stating, \"The evening was a tremendous success from all sides. Singers said the atmosphere felt like the concert was happening in Israel, and concertgoers told me it was the most incredible concert N.Y. had ever seen.\"\n\nBeyond the musical enchantment, the Symphony of the Stars concert carried deeper significance. United Hatzalah volunteers, often at the forefront of emergency responses, were among the initial responders to the October 7th Hamas massacre in Israel. The event aimed to pay tribute to these volunteers, celebrating Jewish unity and pride during challenging times for the Jewish people.\n\n\"We are immensely grateful for the outpouring of support during this challenging time. The Symphony of the Stars was not just a concert; it was a collective expression of solidarity and strength,\" remarked Eli Beer, President and Founder of United Hatzalah. \"Not only did everyone have an amazing time, but by doing so, they allowed us to continue to equip and train our volunteers to provide the fastest and free emergency medical response throughout Israel when it's more needed than ever.\"",

        "body": "J.M.K. Innovation Prize\n\nImpressive article about the honor that I Be Black Girl received. I was unaware of the Omaha organization led by Ashlei Spivey and the work that it does on reproductive justice. The 2023 J.M.K. Innovation Prize was well deserved for the group's work in supporting Black women throughout their pregnancies. In the United States, Black women are three to four times more likely to die from childbirth or from complications after childbirth than white women. I congratulate I Be Black Girl for the work they do, and the award they received. Thanks for the well-written article that tells the Omaha community of this group's work and mission.\n\nAngie Wingert, Omaha\n\nA win for the animals\n\nKudos to investigative and award-winning reporter Henry J. Cordes on his thorough article regarding the horrific issues at the Nebraska Humane Society (Dec. 10).\n\nBecause of his dedication to excellence and uncovering the truth, he has revealed heart-breaking animal care and unimaginable treatment of employees. Because of his article, the CEO and another upper manager have been \"removed\" so that the toxic environment will no longer be tolerated. Without Henry's investigation, the innocent animals would continue to languish at the shelter and lose out on being adopted into loving homes.\n\nHenry Cordes continues to be a driving force in shining the light on injustices at nonprofits and is an amazing asset for the Omaha World-Herald. Well done, Henry! If the animals could speak, they would enthusiastically thank you.\n\nKerry Ecklebe, Omaha\n\nPraise for Cordes article\n\nI would like to publicly thank Henry J. Cordes for his investigative reporting on the Nebraska Humane Society. It is disappointing to me that it took investigative reporting to urge the NHS board members to take a harder look at the inner workings of their own organization, however, particularly when it is clear that so many employees have shared their concerns with NHS leadership.\n\nI am hopeful that the new NHS leadership will show more commitment and compassion toward their employees -- those dedicated professionals who care so deeply for the animals most at risk in our community. I wish them all the best as they work to heal their own community.\n\nRebecca Britt, Omaha\n\nLeaving a lasting legacy\n\nIn response to Mr. Ostblom's Public Pulse letter (Dec. 8), let me make clear that I want to save Social Security. I've never voted to cut Social Security, and to say otherwise is just regurgitating the talking points of national Democrats and the $35 million in TV ads they've spent to air over the last seven years. Thankfully, our voters know otherwise because I have a proven record.\n\nI have been one of the few elected officials who acknowledges that Social Security will go insolvent in 2033. If we do nothing, every Social Security recipient will lose approximately 20 percent of their benefits in the first year, and even worse for each year to follow. I've been recognized locally and nationally by the AARP for being one of the few voices speaking up and wanting to fix this problem early. As a five-time commander in the Air Force, I know that it is best to head off a crisis early rather than wait until the last moment. I am here to save Social Security and leave a lasting legacy for senior citizens for decades to come.\n\nRep. Don Bacon,\n\nR-Neb., Papillion\n\nRefreshing article\n\nThank you for publishing the big story about the zoo director, Dr. Luis Padilla. It was refreshing to see a story about a veterinarian that does not involve starving horses or spewing carcinogenic pig waste on an industrial scale.\n\nSusie Figginbottom, Omaha\n\nInvest in Nebraska's future\n\nMy husband and I are retired Nebraska educators with our experience totaling 70 years, working in Grand Island, Lincoln, Waverly, Ralston, Raymond Central, and Omaha Westside public schools. Obviously, our priority is public school education in Nebraska. As Ken Bird, former superintendent of Omaha Westside, said: \"Nebraska does not have mountains or oceans, but we do have excellent public schools.\" We are witnesses to that.\n\nGov. Pillen says that school boards have set taxes too high. School districts have local control and have raised taxes under the amount allowable by law as reported in the Omaha World-Herald on December 5th. School districts are looking at their individual needs, figuring out how to meet those needs, and are investing money in our children and the future workforce in Nebraska.\n\nOur daughter is a current teacher in a Nebraska public school. With a shortage of teachers all over the country, we need to be looking at bolstering the pay of teachers in Nebraska, working with schools of education to attract a diverse group of students into education, and making this an inclusive state where teachers want to be employed. Nine out of 10 students in Nebraska go to public schools. Support for public schools is a priority when we are trying to have a highly educated workforce. Nebraska ranks low nationally in its state support for public schools, which means that school boards rely on local property taxes to fill the gap.\n\nIf Gov. Pillen wants property taxes to go down, perhaps he should work with the legislature to revise our tax code and its reliance upon property tax.\n\nSupport of our public schools is an investment in Nebraska's future! Please thank your boards of education for their work, thank your district's administrators and teachers for their dedication, and contact your state legislature about the importance of public school education.\n\nMarie Meyers, Omaha\n\nLetters to the Editor The Public Pulse: College football playoffs; Anonymous call for cease-fire lacks courage Letters to the Editor The Public Pulse: Bring back old meters; Gambling in Nebraska; Living in Trump's America Letters to the Editor The Public Pulse: Thanks to Sen.

        "body": "There are countless, nameless, faceless heroes who act on behalf of the United States and the world to keep us safe. They do this because of a love for our country and for their belief in its noble ideals.\n\nOn Oct. 21, I had the pleasure of being in the presence of champions of idealism and exemplars of our noble ideals while attending the OSS (Office of Strategic Services) Society's William J. Donovan Award Dinner. The William J. Donovan Award Dinner is the preeminent annual gathering of the U.S. intelligence and Special Operations communities.\n\nThe OSS was the first organized effort by the United States to implement a centralized system of strategic intelligence during World War II, and was the predecessor to the Central Intelligence Agency, the U.S. Special Operations Command, and the U.S. Department of State's Bureau of Intelligence and Research. The OSS Society was founded by General William Donovan in 1947 as a way to honor the historic achievements of the agents who acted in World War II.\n\nHoffmann to temporarily close some Augusta businesses, wineries Cardinals finalize manager Oliver Marmol's coaching staff with two new additions 12 best men's colognes of all time in 2024 Blues fire coach Craig Berube amid four-game losing streak Catholic school closures across St. Louis area to be announced this week Captain Brayden Schenn, goalie Jordan Binnington react to dismissal of Craig Berube 15 best oils to support hair growth Ian Froeb names the 13 best new St. Louis restaurants of 2023 Developers want to build 1,200 homes in O'Fallon, firing up St. Charles County boom 'Never a doubt': Ruby Leigh lands in 'The Voice' finals From a small Missouri town to 'The Voice' finals: Ruby Leigh says 'It's all pretty crazy' St. Louis developer owes $800K in property taxes. It's causing problems at City Hall. No Catholic grade schools are marked for closure in St. Louis Archdiocese downsizing St. Louis nursing home abruptly closes, leaving workers unpaid, residents relocated Blues GM Doug Armstrong on firing Craig Berube: 'I feel personally responsible for the situation'\n\nThere were nine noble ideals which were highlighted with each award winner at the dinner: Equality, freedom, justice, diplomacy, knowledge, truth, understanding, service, and most importantly, democracy\n\nThere were four awards conferred that night, each one named for a previous OSS Society member. Charles T. Pinck, current president of the OSS Society, partnered each award with at least one of those noble ideals.\n\nPinck began his remarks by repeating a phrase uttered by one of the award's namesakes, Dr. Ralph Bunche, \"Hearts beat strongest in response to noble ideals.\"\n\nBunche was born in Detroit in 1903. He attended UCLA and later earned a doctorate in political science from Harvard University in 1934. He was the first African American to receive a doctorate in political science from an American university.\n\nBunche spent the bulk of his career helping colonized nations become decolonized. He served in the OSS' Research and Analysis Branch, the predecessor to the State Department's Bureau of Intelligence and Research. During World War II, Bunche understood the threat of Nazism and its dangers to democracy.\n\nIn 1946, Bunche went into United Nations service, and in the following year the U.N. Secretary-General sent him to the Middle East to help to devise a plan for dividing Palestine between Arabs and Jews.\n\nThe Arabs rejected the U.N. resolution establishing a Jewish state and went to war with Israel. When the chief U.N. negotiator Folke Bernadotte was assassinated by Jewish extremists in the autumn of 1948, Bunche replaced him. The following year Bunche succeeded in bringing about a cease-fire, after tough negotiations between the new state of Israel and its Arab neighbors.\n\nBunche was awarded The Nobel Peace Prize in 1950 for negotiating the 1949 Armistice Agreements between Israel and four Arab states. He was the first African American and person of color to receive the award. He died on December 9, 1971.\n\nAt least for me, Bunche will forever be associated with the words \"noble\" and \"Nobel.\" Both of which are richly deserved. I also can't help but think we could use his diplomatic skills right about now.\n\nAt the October award dinner, Ambassador Anne Patterson won the Ralph Bunche Award. Tom Brokaw was awarded the Arthur Schlesinger Jr. Award. VADM Joseph Maguire received the Jack Taylor Award. Finally, the Honorable William J. Burns, current director of the CIA, won the evening's most distinguished award, the William J. Donovan Award.\n\nPrevious Donovan Award winners included President Dwight D. Eisenhower, Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher, Adm. William H. McRaven, and the Hon. James N. Mattis.\n\nIntelligence and special operations officials have long served as the \"tip of the spear\" as our nation's first line of defense. Many in this community are idealists when it comes to the experiment that is the United States of America. Idealists see the world as it might be, as it could be, or as it should be. They focus on the importance of ideas and can be truly inspiring.\n\nBut because of the nature of their work, Americans will never know who most of them are or have the opportunity to be inspired by their stories. That is why we need to celebrate those who we know about, like Bunche.\n\nAmericans should also understand that these brave individuals, who are being attacked from some quarters today as the \"Deep State,\" put their lives on the line each day to ensure our country is as safe and secure as it can be.\n\nAs the calendar draws closer to 2024 and what looks to be a contentious election season, it is the people of the United States that make us great, not a slogan or a demagogue.\n\nIt may be also helpful to remind all Americans of the values that bind us together as a nation: Equality, freedom, justice, diplomacy, knowledge, truth, understanding, service, and democracy. While we may not always get it right, there is nobility in striving towards these things.\n\nLynn Schmidt is a Post-Dispatch columnist Editorial Board member. lynnschmidtrn@outlook.com.\n\n0 Comments",

These revelations, however, did not deter the National Lawyers Guild, a left-wing coalition of attorneys working \"to the end that human rights and the rights of ecosystems shall be regarded as more sacred than property interests,\" from recently presenting Alliance for Global Justice with its annual award named after the late socialist legal expert Debra Evenson.\n\nBIDEN BEAT TRUMP 'CHAOS' IN 2020 -- NOW NIKKI HALEY WANTS TO DO THE SAME\n\n\"AFGJ supports locally-based grassroots organizing by sharing political analysis, mobilizing for direct action, monitoring the centers of corporate and government power, expanding channels of communication, and sharing skills and infrastructure,\" the National Lawyers Guild said on its website.\n\nThe award was also given to Costa Rica-based environmental lawyer Emily Yozell, and it underscores how self-identified progressive activist hubs remain deeply connected with entities supporting terrorism, particularly after the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack against Israel that killed more than 1,200 people in the Jewish state. Through an arrangement known as fiscal sponsorship, AFGJ provides services such as payroll, donation processing, and human resources for anti-Israel projects, including the Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network -- an Israeli-designated terrorist coalition. Samidoun has shared staffers with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.\n\nNamed after Debra Evenson, who was president of the National Lawyers Guild between 1988 and 1991 and represented the Cuban government, the \"Venceremos\" award celebrates \"outstanding international legal work, legal solidarity, international advocacy, and justice beyond borders,\" according to the National Lawyers Guild. Venceremos is Spanish for \"we will overcome\" and was the name of a Marxist Chicano group in the 1960s and 1970s in California that engaged in violence with the goal of overthrowing the U.S. government.\n\nIt has been a rough year for Alliance for Global Justice, which has been dropped by four payment processors, PayPal, Stripe, Deluxe, and Salsa Labs, due to the companies' concerns about the charity's ties to terrorism. Moreover, some of the most influential liberal grantmakers have pledged they will no longer donate to the nonprofit group in the future. Those include New Venture Fund, Windward Fund, the Ford Foundation, and the League of Conservation Voters, among others.\n\nSamidoun, the Israeli-designated terrorist coalition housed under AFGJ, has been organizing pro-Hamas protests after Oct. 7 and was recently slapped with a ban in Germany because its activists reportedly dished out candy to Berlin protesters to celebrate Palestinian terrorism.\n\nSign up for free: Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country overnight and the stories to follow throughout the day delivered to your inbox each evening.\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

        "body": "With its cover made up of puzzle pieces that form national flags, Yoram Hazony's The Virtue of Nationalism gestures at a harmonious whole composed of distinctive parts. The book, which has been praised in conservative outlets, is the most visible of recent attempts by figures including Yascha Mounk, John Judis, and Lawrence Summers to make nationalism palatable again.\n\nWith its cover made up of puzzle pieces that form national flags, Yoram Hazony's The Virtue of Nationalism gestures at a harmonious whole composed of distinctive parts. The book, which has been praised in conservative outlets, is the most visible of recent attempts by figures including Yascha Mounk, John Judis, and Lawrence Summers to make nationalism palatable again.\n\nBut there's a core irony in the book. Hazony argues for the centrality of innate group identity over common political commitments, yet this is a deeply global book. The Virtue of Nationalism underscores the common underpinnings of the Israeli right, the Trump administration, ethnonationalists, and indeed neofascists the world over. In Hazony's book, full of historical anachronism, false binaries, and logical flaws, a reader can find an explanation of how far-right Israeli leader Benjamin Netanyahu can embrace a U.S. president who tweets anti-Semitic memes, a Hungarian authoritarian, and a neofascist Brazilian patriarch. The Virtue of Nationalism's most important contribution may be in creating a theoretical scaffolding for contemporary nationalism's darkest impulses.\n\nIn Hazony's telling, the national state represents a happy midpoint between the anarchical tendencies of clan-based or tribal politics and the globalizing vision of empires, ancient and modern. This conflict between competing political models is, he asserts, as old as the Hebrew Bible itself. It was the ancient Israelites who first gathered together as a political unit, providing Western political thought's first example of a national state.\n\nThe national state thus conceived allows for the expression of each people's unique cultural inheritance -- its particular laws and language, religious traditions, and view of history -- and stands in opposition to universalizing empires bent on doing away with difference. Echoing John Stuart Mill, he argues that the existence of multiple \"national laboratories\" each competing with one another permits us to collectively learn what forms of social, cultural, and political organization are best.\n\nOver and against the universal aspirations of the Catholic Church and the Holy Roman Empire, the emerging national states of England, the Netherlands, France, Switzerland, Sweden, and Denmark -- rooted in, according to Hazony, a fundamental \"Protestant construction\" of legitimate and independent government -- asserted the right to chart their own course.\n\nThe essential dignity of the national state was recognized by the Peace of Westphalia and continued unchallenged until it fell out of favor following World War II. The subsequent dismissal of nationalism, Hazony asserts, stemmed from a misunderstanding of the Third Reich: Adolf Hitler was not a true nationalist but rather an imperialist looking to resurrect the Holy Roman Empire. Liberals essentially learned the wrong lesson from the war, which resulted in the creation of a new imperial body dominated by Germany -- the European Union -- that has robbed its member states of their sovereignty. In turn, the surge of multiculturalism that accompanied globalization put nationalists everywhere on the defensive against liberal-imperialist political ideals (e.g., universal human rights, the International Criminal Court, and global trade regulations). While there are a number of trenchant critiques to be made of any and all of these institutions, Hazony prefers to dismiss them out of hand as \"among the most powerful agents fomenting intolerance and hate in the Western world today.\"\n\nMuch of this is patently and verifiably false. Nationalism and imperialism often complemented rather than opposed each other. His version of Hitler's motivations relies on the misinterpretation of isolated remarks in order to ignore the fundamental nationalism of Nazism. And the ancient Hebrews had no conception, however hazy, of anything like the modern national state.\n\nThe idea that countries arose because of nationalist sentiment among the hodgepodge of peoples who lived in these territories -- rather than the political ambitions of their monarchs -- is false, yet it offers a clear example of Hazony's view of national identity as innate, stable, and prior to the modern state. This type of ahistorical thinking is in fact perfectly cogent within Hazony's overarching theory that human collectives -- be it the family, tribe, or nation -- \"maintain their existence through time, holding fast to certain fixed purposes and forms.\" That's why classic works on nationalism, such as those of Benedict Anderson, Eugen Weber, and Ernest Gellner, are disparaged in a lone footnote. Their detailed historical account of how institutions, commerce, and state power inculcate a sense of shared identity has no place in Hazony's eternal and unchanging collectives.\n\nBut Hazony's mistaken view of history is secondary to his far more consequential premises about the nature of political cohesion. The book is at its most fascinating, illuminating, and dangerous in excavating a different genealogy of the state from the version proposed by liberal political theory. Hazony lays out his case by differentiating between the bonds that link people together in a business relationship -- built upon individual freedom, calculation, and consent -- and those that unite the family. Railing again generations of liberal thinkers who have regarded politics as an extension of commercial relations, Hazony contends that the state is instead an extension of the family unit into which one is either born or adopted. The national community is thus the natural extension of the \"strong bonds of mutual loyalty\" of the natal family and produces cohesion not because of common ideological commitments but because it represents an extension of the self.\n\nIn a line sure to delight aspiring authoritarians, Hazony argues that the traits that are beneficial within a business enterprise -- individual freedom, rational calculation, and public deliberation and debate, i.e., the stuff of liberal democratic theory -- are wholly out of place in the family and, by extension, the state. Rather, the family requires its members to practice \"loyalty, devotion, and constraint.\" It is in tracing these fundamentally anti-democratic principles to a genealogy of the state based in the patriarchal family that Hazony is at his most original. He is, of course, not the first to put the family at the center of nationalist ideologies, and one could draw many unsavory comparisons to figures from the past century -- from Philippe Pétain's travail, famille, patrie to Benito Mussolini's glorification of motherhood. What sets Hazony apart is his attempt to grant patriarchal authoritarianism a more distinguished lineage, one that is supposedly rooted in empirical reality as opposed to some fanciful \"state of nature\" in which individuals joined together to create governments. Indeed, he seems to believe that by proving that no such original state ever existed in the past, he can render such consent irrelevant to the present and future as well.\n\nHazony's worldview does not entirely exclude freedom. Yet individual freedom, he claims, can be achieved only collectively. As an example, he cites the predicament of American Jews during World War II, who, unable to access the reins of state power, were also unable to act on the slaughter of their brethren in Europe.\n\nTrue freedom is thus envisioned as the collective ability to act in the nation's interest, which can exist only when the nation has control over the state apparatus. Consequently, \"[o]nly the national state, governed by individuals drawn from the tribes of the nation itself, can be a free state.\" It is with that conviction in mind that he disparages the possibility of a neutral or civic state that claims to exist without the \"particularistic commitments to any of the different nations, languages, or religions within its borders.\"\n\nYet the existence of the United States refutes Hazony's arguments. He is right in noting the country's roots in Protestant Christian communities and how many of its supposedly secular civic rituals similarly grow out of this particular heritage. But as with his remarks regarding the social contract, his fixation on origins as determinative blinds him to what is best about states like the United States, which are not built to serve a singular nation. For Hazony, practical considerations mean that minority communities can be grafted on the core national group, but they cannot penetrate it -- still less represent it. Yet the civic state actually does have the capacity to deal with difference in another way altogether: not by effacing what is particular but by expressing it as the core of what is national. This is not your standard melting pot in which everything gets combined into a singular mush. It's more akin to something like jazz, which is both the creation of a particular minority community and quintessentially American -- not merely tolerated but celebrated. It is true that the United States has failed to live up to this ideal repeatedly over the course of its history, but it is equally true that only a civic state has the potential to do so. In contrast, Hazony claims that stable and free states require \"a majority nation whose cultural dominance is plain and unquestioned, and against which resistance appears to be futile.\" One can almost hear Richard Spencer applauding in the background.\n\nHaving rooted this argument in the familylike nature of political community, Hazony then goes on the offensive against anyone or anything that might interfere with the national state's absolute sovereignty within its borders. Thus he celebrates Britain's so-called independence from the European Union, Israel's building blitz in East Jerusalem, America's refusal to allow its soldiers to appear before the International Criminal Court, and the right of nations to legislate in support of \"traditional religious views of marriage\" and to enact anti-immigration and refugee policies. Putting nationalism at the center of his analysis also offers a way to critique the free trade agenda that transforms \"business enterprises into 'multinational' corporations that serve the global economy rather than any particular national interest.\" Tellingly, he has nothing to say about global entities such as the International Monetary Fund and the World Bank, which are the frequent target of leftists for undermining national sovereignty in meaningful ways. So, too, citing Margaret Thatcher as inspiration, he supports universal technical standards for the sake of economic efficiency -- just not universal labor protections, social security, or modes of taxation. These positions, which generate no shortage of contradictions, can be read as an attempt to put theoretical legs on an ungainly creature we might term neoliberal nationalism.\n\nMoreover, his defense of national sovereignty against so-called globalists reaches its theoretical and moral limits fairly quickly when it comes up against the shibboleths of the American or Israeli right. The 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq -- as imperial a venture as any -- is rebranded as an attempt by the United States \"to solve pressing security problems on its own.\" Similarly, there are numerous theoretical positions that seem custom-made to support Israel's land grab in the West Bank. For instance, he concedes that his model does not allow for universal self-determination; each people's case must be weighed \"only in the balance of moral and prudential considerations.\"\n\nNations found wanting for military or economic strength, cohesion, or defensible borders -- or deemed a threat to the well-being of others -- should rather content themselves by seeking \"a protectorate state with some measure of delegated authority\" latched onto a more powerful and fully independent neighbor. The resonance between Hazony's theoretical argument and the proposal for Palestinian \"autonomy on steroids\" forwarded by the Israeli right should not be treated as mere coincidence. Coming on the heels of the country's controversial nation-state law, those familiar with the inner world of Jewish politics will quickly grasp the debt Hazony's thinking owes to a particular version of Zionism.\n\nThis is not to say there's nothing worthwhile about Hazony's intervention. Like others who have noted the salience of national identity in an age of globalization, Hazony is right to note these rumblings of discontent. In particular, isolation and alienation are genuine social problems in every industrialized nation, having been linked to higher levels of depression, withdrawal, addiction, and violence. Yet here national identity is more snake oil than salve. As sociologists have long argued, local communities are, in fact, most beneficial when it comes to countering alienation and building a positive sense of identity. These might include religious congregations, cooperative ventures, neighborhood associations, or parenting groups. Such communities run counter to everything Hazony holds to be true about identity: They are based on the consent and active participation of their members and, as such, are dynamic and evolving rather than stable or preexisting. A sense of national connection with millions of individuals who share your ethnic and religious heritage is no substitute for the role of face-to-face interaction and cooperation at the local level.\n\nAt the global level, nationalism fails as strongly as on a local scale. Hazony repeatedly argues, for example, that more global or cosmopolitan identities are impossible because humanity has no common enemy. Yet, in the face of climate change, we face just such a foe. How are we to address coral bleaching, rising sea levels, and extreme drought through nationalist means? Should Jair Bolsonaro be allowed to deforest the Amazon, which releases an estimated 20 percent of the planet's oxygen? It is not that we lack collective problems. It is that nationalism is both too big and too small to address them.\n\nNor does this mean, in Hazony's logic, that to denounce nationalism is to embrace the imperial ordering of the world. Rather, articulating alternative solutions requires moving beyond false binaries that hold nationalism and imperialism to be the only available options. Even Hazony seems to grasp the limits of his model when it comes to certain types of interventions but still tries to shoehorn them into a nationalist framework. Thus, he argues, the world's nations had no choice but to interfere when faced with Hitler and Joseph Stalin because \"[t]he crimes these men committed against their own people were only a prelude to the attempt to destroy all the neighboring national states and to annex their populations to a universal empire.\"\n\nAre we to conclude that had the Third Reich targeted only German Jews but not those across the border in Poland, the international community should have remained on the sidelines? How is one to know for sure when crimes committed internally are a prelude to those of outward aggression? And why shouldn't nations everywhere, under such logic, fight environmental policies that put them all at risk -- indeed, that in some cases threaten their very existence?\n\nGiven that authoritarian nationalism is on the rise -- from Vladimir Putin and Recep Tayyip Erdogan to Viktor Orban and, of course, the upstart Donald Trump -- Hazony's book is likely to find fans the world over. Its chief virtue, if we can call it that, is offering a remarkably cogent view of how the right views the world: patriarchal, blood-based, and remarkably stable over time. Like all reactionaries who appeal to some primordial way of the world, Hazony doesn't so much as argue for a return to what has passed as inaugurate something new. And indeed, his work underscores how the new nationalism is anti-democratic to its core, resorting to a collectivist vision of freedom in which disdain for the dignity and liberty of the individual is not incidental but foundational. That the nation may be coercive toward its members in a way that the international community is forbidden from doing so regarding individual nations is but one of the book's many logical difficulties.\n\nFinally, for anyone who has ever marveled at the seeming incoherence of Jews teaming up with anti-Semites (or those happily supported by them), reading Hazony's book can help clarify that these are not mere marriages of convenience. Looking beyond the primacy of ethnonational identity, we rather find strong points of ideological overlap that link these unlikely bedfellows. As I noted early in the Trump administration, there is a long history of anti-Semites supporting Zionism as a solution to the so-called problem of having to live with Jews. In the aftermath of the Tree of Life synagogue shooting, there is a growing awareness that this problem rather lies with those who dream of ethnic homogeneity -- whether they reside in Pittsburgh or Jerusalem. Coming to terms with this reality requires us to grasp the extent to which identities are cultivated rather than innate and to trace our alliances across communities rather than along their fault lines.",

        "title": "Gaudete Sunday anticipates the divine visit which dispels the darkness of Advent - LifeSite",
        "body": "(LifeSiteNews) -- Today again, the Church is full of joy, and the joy is greater than it was. It is true that her Lord is not come; but she feels that He is nearer than before, and therefore she thinks it just to lessen somewhat the austerity of this penitential season by the innocent cheerfulness of her sacred rites.\n\nAnd first, this Sunday has had the name of Gaudete given to it, from the first word of the Introit; it also is honored with those impressive exception which belong to the fourth Sunday of Lent, called Lætare. The organ is played at the Mass; the vestments are Rose color; the deacon resumes the dalmatic, and the subdeacon the tunic; and in cathedral churches, the bishop assists with the precious mitre. How touching are all these usages, and how admirable this condescension of the Church, wherewith she so beautifully blends together the unalterable strictness of the dogmas of faith and the graceful poetry of the formulæ of her liturgy! Let us enter into her spirit, and be glad on this third Sunday of her Advent, because Our Lord is now so near unto us. Tomorrow we will resume our attitude of servants mourning for the absence of their Lord and waiting for Him; for every delay, however short, is painful and makes love sad.\n\nThe Station is kept in the Basilica of St. Peter, at the Vatican. This august temple, which contains the tomb of the Prince of the Apostles, is the home and refuge of all the faithful of the world; it is but natural that it should be chosen to be witness both of the joy and the sadness of the Church.\n\nThe Night Office commences with a new Invitatory. The voice of the Church no longer invites the faithful to come and adore in fear and trembling the King, Our Lord, who is to come. Her language assumes another character; her tone is one of gladness; and now, every day, until the vigil of Christmas, she begins her Nocturns with these grand words:\n\nThe Lord is now nigh; come, let us adore.\n\nNow let us take the book of the Prophet, and read with the Church:\n\nIn that day shall this canticle be sung the land of Juda. Sion the city of our strength a savior, a wall and a bulwark shall be set therein. Open ye the gates, and let the just nation, that keepeth the truth, enter in. The old error is passed away: thou wilt keep peace: peace, because we have hoped in thee. You have hoped in the Lord for evermore, in the Lord God mighty forever. For he shall bring down them that dwell on high, the high city he shall lay low. He shall bring it down even to the ground, he shall pull it down even to the dust. The foot shall tread it down, the feet of the poor, the steps of the needy. The way of the just is right, the path of the just is right to walk in. And in the way of thy judgments, O Lord, we have patiently waited for thee: thy name, and thy remembrance are the desire of the soul. My soul hath desired thee in the night: yea, and with my spirit within me in the morning early I will watch to thee.\n\nO Holy Roman Church, City of our Strength! Behold us thy children assembled within thy walls, around the tomb of the Fisherman, the Prince of the Apostles, whose sacred relics protect thee from their earthly shrine, and whose unchanging teaching enlightens thee from heaven. Yet, O City of strength! it is by the Savior, who is coming, that thou art strong. He is thy wall, for it is He that encircles, with His tender mercy, all thy children; He is thy bulwark, for it is by Him that thou art invincible, and that all the powers of hell are powerless to prevail against thee. Open wide thy gates, that all nations may enter thee; for thou art mistress of holiness and the guardian of truth.\n\nMay the old error, which sets itself against the faith, soon disappear, and peace reign over the whole fold! O Holy Roman Church! thou hast forever put thy trust in the Lord; and he, faithful to his promise, has humbled before thee the haughty ones that defiled thee, and the proud cities that were against thee. Where now are the cæsars, who boasted that they had drowned thee in thine own blood? Where the emperors, who would ravish the inviolate virginity of thy faith? Where the heretics, who, during the past centuries of thine existence, have assailed every article of thy teaching, and denied what they listed? Where the ungrateful princes, who would fain make a slave of thee, who had made them what they were? Where that Empire of Mahomet, which has so many times raged against thee, for that thou, the defenseless state, didst arrest the pride of its conquests?\n\nWhere the Reformers, who were bent on giving the world a Christianity, in which thou wast to have no part? Where the more modern sophists, in whose philosophy thou wast set down as a system that had been tried, and was a failure, and is now a ruin? And those kings who are acting the tyrant over thee, and those people that will have liberty independently and at the risk of truth, where will they be in another hundred years? Gone and forgotten as the noisy anger of a torrent; while thou, O holy Church of Rome, built on the immovable rock, wilt be as calm, as young, as unwrinkled as ever. Thy path through all the ages of this world's duration, will be right as that of the just man; thou wilt ever be the self-same unchanging Church, as thou hast been during the eighteen hundred years past, while everything else under the sun has been but change.\n\nWhence this thy stability, but from Him who is very Truth and Justice? Glory be to Him in thee! Each year, He visits thee; each year, He brings thee new gifts, wherewith thou mayest go happily through thy pilgrimage; and to the end of time, He will visit thee, and renew thee, not only with the power of that look wherewith Peter was renewed, but by filling thee with Himself as He did the ever glorious virgin, who is the object of thy most tender love, after that which thou bearest to JesusHhimself. We pray with thee, O Church, our Mother! And here is our prayer: Come, Lord Jesus! \"Thy name and thy remembrance are the desires of our souls: they have desired thee in the night, yea, and early in the morning have they watched for thee.\"\n\nThe assembly of the faithful is attentive; the chanters intone the Gregorian melody, and the church echoes with these sweet words:\n\nINTROIT\n\nRejoice in the Lord always: again I say, rejoice. Let your modesty be known to all men: for the Lord is nigh. Be nothing solicitous: but in every prayer let your petitions be made known to God.\n\nPs. O Lord, thou hast blessed thy land: thou hast turned away the captivity of Jacob. ℣. Glory.\n\nIn the Collect, the Church asks for the grace of that divine visit which dispels darkness and brings light. Darkness produces fear in the soul; whereas light gives courage and joy to the heart.\n\nCOLLECT\n\nBend thine ear, O Lord, we beseech thee, to our prayers; and enlighten the darkness of our minds by the grace of thy visitation. Who livest, etc.\n\nThe other Collects of the Blessed Virgin, against the Persecutors of the Church, and for the Pope, are given in the Mass of the first Sunday of Advent.\n\nRejoice in the Lord always; again, I say, rejoice.Let your modesty be known to all men. The Lord is nigh.Be nothing solicitous; but in everything, by prayer and supplication, with thanksgiving, let your petitions be made known to God.And the peace of God, which surpasseth all understanding, keep your hearts and minds in Christ Jesus.\n\nNothing is more just than that we rejoice in the Lord. Both the prophet and the apostle excite us to desire the Savior: both of them promise us peace. Therefore, let us not be solicitous: The Lord is nigh; nigh to His Church, and nigh to each of our souls. Who can be near so burning a fire, and yet be cold? Do we not feel that he is coming to us, in spite of all these obstacles? He will let nothing be a barrier between Himself and us, neither His own infinite high majesty, nor our exceeding lowliness, nor our many sins.\n\nYet a little while, and He will be with us. Let us go out to meet Him these prayers and supplications and thanksgiving which the apostle recommends to us. Let our zeal unite ourselves with our Holy Mother the Church become more than ever fervent: now every day her prayers will increase in intense earnestness, and her longings after Him who is her light and her love, will grow more ardent. First let us say together with her:\n\nGRADUAL\n\nO Lord, who sittest on the Cherubim, exert thy power and come.\n\n℣. Thou who rulest Israel, hearken. Thou who leadest Joseph as a sheep.\n\nAlleluia, alleluia.\n\n℣. Exert, O Lord, thy power, and come to save us. Alleluia.\n\nThere hath stood One in the midst of you, whom you know not, says St. John the Baptist to them that were sent by the Jews. So that Our Lord may be near, he may even have come, and yet by some be not known! This Lamb of God is the holy precursor's consolation: he considers it a singular privilege to be but the voice, which cries out to men to prepare the way of the Redeemer. In this, St. John is the type of the Church, and of all such as seek Jesus. St. John is full of joy because the Savior is come: but the men around him are as indifferent as though they neither expected nor wanted a Savior.\n\nThis is the third week of Advent; and are all hearts excited by the great tidings told them by the Church, that the Messias is near at hand? They who love Him not as their Savior, do they fear Him as their Judge? Are the crooked ways being made straight? Are the hills being brought low? Are Christians seriously engaged in removing from their hearts the love of riches and the love of sensual pleasures? There is no time to lose: the Lord is nigh! If these lines should come under the eye of any of those Christians who are in this state of sinful indifference, we would conjure them to shake off their lethargy, and render themselves worthy of the visit of the divine Infant: such a visit will bring them the greatest consolation here, and give them confidence hereafter, when Our Lord will come to judge all mankind.\n\nSend thy grace, O Jesus, still more plentifully into their hearts; compel them to go in, and permit not that it be said of the children of the Church, as St. John said of the Synagogue: There standeth in the midst of you One, whom ye know not.\n\nDuring the Offertory, the faithful should unite in the prayer of the Church, and beg that the captivity, in which our sins hold us, may be brought to an end, and that the divine Deliverer may come.\n\nOFFERTORY\n\nLord, thou hast blessed thy land; thou hast turned away the captivity of Jacob, thou hast forgiven the iniquity of thy people.\n\nSECRET\n\nMay we always, O Lord, offer thee this sacrifice of our devotion; both to effect that for which thou didst institute this mystery, and wonderfully to procure ourselves that Salvation which thou designest us. Through, etc.\n\nThe other Secrets as in the First Sunday of Advent.\n\nDuring the Communion, the Church chants the words of the Prophet Isaias, which bid the heart of the sinner take courage. Fear not, Christian people! He that is coming is God; but He comes to save His creatures, and give Himself to them.\n\nCOMMUNION\n\nSay: Be comforted, O ye timid of heart, and fear not; behold our God will come, and save us.\n\nThe Church asks of God, in the following prayer, that the secret visit which she has just been receiving from her divine Spouse, may fit her for that solemn one which she is preparing to receive at the feast of Christmas.\n\nPOSTCOMMUNION\n\nWe implore, O Lord, thy mercy: that these divine helps, having cleansed us from sin, may prepare us for the ensuing solemnity. Through, etc.\n\nBrethren, rejoice in the Lord always: again I say rejoice. Let your modesty be known to all men: the Lord is nigh.\n\nBlessed art thou, O Mary, who didst believe the Lord; what the Lord said to thee shall be fulfilled in thee, alleluia.\n\nBut if the third Sunday of Advent fall on December 17, then instead of the above, is said the first of the Great Antiphons (O Sapientia), which will be found, with the other six, in the proper of saints, from December 17 to 23.\n\nLET US PRAY,\n\nBend thine ear, O Lord, we beseech thee, to our prayers, and enlighten the darkness of our minds by the grace of thy visitation. Who livest, etc.",

        "body": "The oldest progressive bar association in the United States is honoring a charity in Arizona revealed through a Washington Examiner investigation to share ties to Palestinian terrorism.\n\nAlliance for Global Justice, an anti-Israel nonprofit group, has come under legal and congressional scrutiny, and it has lost the ability to process credit card donations in 2023 due to its connections to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. These revelations, however, did not deter the National Lawyers Guild, a left-wing coalition of attorneys working \"to the end that human rights and the rights of ecosystems shall be regarded as more sacred than property interests,\" from recently presenting Alliance for Global Justice with its annual award named after the late socialist legal expert Debra Evenson.\n\nBIDEN BEAT TRUMP 'CHAOS' IN 2020 -- NOW NIKKI HALEY WANTS TO DO THE SAME\n\n\"AFGJ supports locally-based grassroots organizing by sharing political analysis, mobilizing for direct action, monitoring the centers of corporate and government power, expanding channels of communication, and sharing skills and infrastructure,\" the National Lawyers Guild said on its website.\n\nThe award was also given to Costa Rica-based environmental lawyer Emily Yozell, and it underscores how self-identified progressive activist hubs remain deeply connected with entities supporting terrorism, particularly after the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack against Israel that killed more than 1,200 people in the Jewish state. Through an arrangement known as fiscal sponsorship, AFGJ provides services such as payroll, donation processing, and human resources for anti-Israel projects, including the Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network -- an Israeli-designated terrorist coalition. Samidoun has shared staffers with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.\n\nNamed after Debra Evenson, who was president of the National Lawyers Guild between 1988 and 1991 and represented the Cuban government, the \"Venceremos\" award celebrates \"outstanding international legal work, legal solidarity, international advocacy, and justice beyond borders,\" according to the National Lawyers Guild. Venceremos is Spanish for \"we will overcome\" and was the name of a Marxist Chicano group in the 1960s and 1970s in California that engaged in violence with the goal of overthrowing the U.S. government.\n\nIt has been a rough year for Alliance for Global Justice, which has been dropped by four payment processors, PayPal, Stripe, Deluxe, and Salsa Labs, due to the companies' concerns about the charity's ties to terrorism. Moreover, some of the most influential liberal grantmakers have pledged they will no longer donate to the nonprofit group in the future. Those include New Venture Fund, Windward Fund, the Ford Foundation, and the League of Conservation Voters, among others.\n\nSamidoun, the Israeli-designated terrorist coalition housed under AFGJ, has been organizing pro-Hamas protests after Oct. 7 and was recently slapped with a ban in Germany because its activists reportedly dished out candy to Berlin protesters to celebrate Palestinian terrorism.\n\nCollectif Palestine Vaincra, a French group that partners with the PFLP, is also in Samidoun's coalition. In January, the pro-Israel Zachor Legal Institute think tank accused AFGJ in an IRS complaint of providing \"material support\" to terrorism in violation of federal law over the Arizona group fundraising for Collectif Palestine Vaincra, the Washington Examiner reported.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nOver the years, AFGJ has received large checks from the George Soros-backed dark money philanthropy network, Tides Foundation, the Tides Center, Raikes Foundation, Planned Parenthood, and even Vijaya Gadde, an ex-Twitter executive who has come under fire for playing a role in the suppression of the Hunter Biden laptop story.\n\nThe National Lawyers Guild did not return a request for comment.",

        "title": "How Sen. Jim Risch and his Idaho ethos became an unlikely leader on foreign policy as global conflicts rage and his party splits",
        "body": "WASHINGTON - By his own account, Jim Risch arrived in Congress in 2009 as something of an isolationist, less interested in the United States' role around the world than in the domestic issues on which he had focused in three decades as a local prosecutor, Idaho state senator, lieutenant governor and a brief stint as governor.\n\nBut when his longtime friend Mike Crapo - who was in charge of committee assignments in the Senate - laid out Risch's options, the incoming Republican senator turned down a coveted seat on the Appropriations Committee in favor of the Foreign Relations Committee, whose members guide the country's policies across the globe.\n\nFifteen years later, the 80-year-old Idaho rancher has become one of the most influential voices in U.S. foreign policy and a champion of America's alliances around the world - at a time when his party is pulled between seemingly opposite poles: one that sees an active U.S. role in the world as a moral and existential imperative and another, ascendant since the presidency of President Trump, that shuns international partners in favor of an \"America first\" ethos.\n\nAs the top Republican on the Foreign Relations Committee and its chairman from 2019 to 2021, Risch has sought to bridge that divide, heeding the concerns of his constituents in deep-red Idaho while advocating support for U.S. allies and international institutions to keep authoritarian states like Russia, China and Iran at bay.\n\n\"Before I got here, I didn't think this way, but our national security really depends not just on us having a big drawbridge which we can pull up,\" Risch said, \"but having partners, having allies that we can rely on to help us when we get in a spot, or vice versa.\"\n\nRussia's invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 - and Ukraine's unexpectedly successful defense of its territory, backed by the United States and other allies - provided the clearest example of that principle since the end of the Cold War. Yet as a Ukrainian counteroffensive has fallen short of its goals this year, support for U.S. aid to Kyiv has waned among GOP voters and lawmakers.\n\n\"The biggest threat that my constituents feel is not from there; it's from our southern border,\" Risch said, where thousands of migrants cross the U.S.-Mexico border illegally each day, according to federal data. About half of those people get deported, while the rest are allowed to stay in the country - often for years - as they await hearings in an asylum process that nearly everyone in Congress agrees is broken.\n\nThose priorities - and the rifts they expose between and within the parties - are encapsulated in a complex legislative package Congress is now negotiating, for which Senate Democratic leaders said Thursday the chamber would delay its holiday recess, even though the GOP-led House has departed. The potential deal would pair aid to Ukraine, Israel and other allies, requested by President Joe Biden, with the most significant changes in U.S. asylum policy in more than three decades, demanded by Republicans.\n\nIn interviews over the course of a month, Risch laid out a worldview that unites those policies under the banner of national security. At a gathering of diplomats, lawmakers and military officials from around the world in November in Halifax, Nova Scotia, he said the war in Ukraine and the Oct. 7 terror attacks in Israel by Hamas have caused democracies and authoritarian states - \"the good guys\" and \"the bad guys,\" respectively - to \"come together tighter.\"\n\n\"And that is going to perpetuate, I think, into the future,\" Risch said. \"So what does that mean for mankind? I view this as a challenge for the rest of the 21st century: How we figure out how to occupy the planet without killing each other.\"\n\nHis current and former colleagues in Congress, the state legislature and the governor's office described a man whose intelligence and blunt, sometimes brash style have earned him respect among members of both parties in Congress and his counterparts from around the world.\n\nCrapo, Idaho's senior senator, said his fellow Republican hasn't fundamentally changed since they met in 1984, when Crapo was elected to the Idaho state Senate. At the time, Risch was the Senate president pro tempore - who presides over the chamber - a position Crapo took on after Risch lost his seat to a Democrat in 1988.\n\nAs the pro tem, Risch gained an undeserved reputation as \"an iron-fisted leader,\" Crapo said, when in reality he was an \"incredibly results-oriented\" pragmatist who worked hard to build support for his priorities.\n\n\"He's a very strong leader,\" Crapo said. \"But he also understands that leading involves getting the support and developing the right ideas and principles that your colleagues will support them. And he was very flexible in doing that, and I don't mean he gave up on his principles at all.\"\n\nCrapo said that same work ethic has made Risch a tireless student of international affairs who uses the expertise of his staff to educate and influence other lawmakers.\n\n\"Jim Risch has gotten one of the plum positions in the United States Congress,\" Crapo said. \"It's already one of the most powerful positions in the Senate. He's turned it into one in which he personally has become, I think, probably the leading foreign relations expert in the Congress.\"\n\nSen. Mitt Romney of Utah, a member of the committee whose path from being the 2012 Republican nominee for president to GOP outcast illustrates how far the party has shifted since Trump's rise, said Risch has the respect and attention of even the Senate Republicans who don't agree with him.\n\n\"He has a lot of credibility, particularly with the Republican caucus, and he's able to bring in historical perspective to the Ukraine aid issue,\" Romney said. \"He has spoken numerous times to our caucus as a group and described at some length the implications of not supporting Ukraine, given the commitments we made when they relinquished their nuclear weapons.\"\n\nRisch said that is his go-to argument when explaining his support for Ukraine, whether to a constituent in Idaho or a skeptical colleague in Congress. He asks them if they have heard of the Budapest Memorandum, a 1994 agreement that saw Ukraine give up the nuclear weapons it had inherited from the collapsed Soviet Union in exchange for the promise that the United States and its allies would protect them in the event of an attack.\n\n\"When you give your word, you've got to keep your word,\" Risch said. \"If the world sees us throw Ukraine under the bus, what would you do if you were Japan or South Korea? You'd be saying, 'We've got to have nuclear weapons, because the U.S. isn't going to take care of us.' \"\n\nSen. Mike Rounds, a South Dakota Republican, said that matter-of-fact way of communicating is one of Risch's virtues.\n\n\"He says it like it is,\" Rounds said in Halifax. \"If he likes something, he'll tell you he likes it. If you have a good question, he'll tell you it's a good question. And if he thinks it's dumb, he'll tell you it's dumb. I mean, it's a pretty refreshing way to do business.\"\n\nSen. John Barrasso, a Wyoming Republican, said that candor sets Risch apart from many of his counterparts in a world where cautious, diplomatic language is the norm. Barrasso recalled a meeting at a previous year's Halifax International Security Form, when he said Risch told a German ambassador during a meeting over a pipeline that would have carried gas from Russia to Germany, \"It's really hard to see you holding hands under the table with the Russian bear.\"\n\n\"People know where they stand when he talks to them, because he's talking like a guy from Idaho,\" Barrasso said. \"I mean, this guy is Idaho through and through.\"\n\nHistorically, though, not every guy from Idaho has taken the same approach to foreign policy. Three senators from the Gem State have chaired the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, a number unmatched by any other state since Idaho was admitted to the Union in 1890.\n\nSen. William Borah, a progressive Republican who chaired the committee from 1924 to 1933, was an outspoken isolationist who, as leader of the so-called \"Irreconcilables,\" blocked the ratification of the Treaty of Versailles, preventing the United States from joining the League of Nations after World War I.\n\n\"Back in those days, it was a lot easier to be that,\" Risch said. \"We had two oceans that separated us. We didn't have the communications or the travel or anything else. This world now is so small.\"\n\nSen. Frank Church, a Democrat who chaired the panel from 1979 to 1981, made a name for himself by reining in the government's involvement overseas, authoring the legislation that effectively ended the Vietnam War and then leading an investigation of abuses by U.S. intelligence agencies. Standing in his office and brandishing a recently published book about Church, \"The Last Honest Man,\" Barrasso took issue with the title.\n\n\"Jim Risch is the honest man,\" the Wyomingite said of his friend. \"Church went Washington. Jim Risch stayed Idaho.\"\n\nIn contrast to Church, who embraced life in the nation's capital, Risch flies home nearly every weekend, a long commute made slightly easier by the fact that his ranch is near the airport in Boise. Risch likes to point out that of the three Idahoans who have led the panel, he's the only one who hasn't run for president.\n\nSen. Marco Rubio, a Florida Republican who has worked with Risch on the Foreign Relations and Intelligence panels, said the Idahoan keeps a lower profile than many previous Foreign Relations leaders - including Biden - who used the position as a springboard for higher political aspirations.\n\n\"For most Americans, he'll probably be the best senator and the most impactful senator you may not have heard of,\" Rubio said. \"I think he likes his job and he enjoys the work he does here, but I don't think he's one of these people that's, like, obsessed with politics or defines his life by what happens to his career in the U.S. Senate.\"\n\nEven so, Risch appears destined to play a prominent role in foreign policy before his third term ends at the close of 2026. When he took the gavel as committee chairman in 2019, in the second half of Trump's presidency, he kept a lower profile than his Republican predecessor, Sen. Bob Corker of Tennessee, who openly criticized Trump's foreign policy decisions.\n\nWhen Democrats took control of the Senate in 2022, Sen. Bob Menendez of New Jersey took over as chairman, but Menendez was indicted on federal corruption and bribery charges in September and October, leading many of his fellow Democrats to call for his resignation. Sen. Ben Cardin of Maryland, who had already announced his retirement at the end of 2023, took over as interim chairman.\n\nRisch has avoided directly criticizing Menendez while speaking highly of both Cardin and Sen. Jeanne Shaheen of New Hampshire, who co-led the U.S. delegation to Halifax in November and will be the top Democrat on the committee if Menendez steps down or is defeated in a re-election bid. Depending on the outcome of the 2024 election, either she or Risch will be in line to lead the panel.\n\nShaheen, whose mother is from Yakima, said she has a \"very positive\" working relationship with Risch, in part because they were both governors before coming to Congress. Although neither she nor Risch are leading negotiations on the national security bill, Shaheen said she was hopeful the two parties could reach a compromise.\n\n\"My experience is that negotiations usually fail when one side or the other overreaches,\" Shaheen said Tuesday. Her question for Republicans, she added, is that if the deal falls apart, \"Are you willing to let Ukraine fail?\"\n\nIn an interview later that day, Risch rejected that question, insisting that border policy reforms can and must be part of the national security package. He emphasized that fewer than 10 of the Senate's 100 members oppose additional aid for Ukraine, while conceding that even a similar share of resistance in the House - where Republicans hold a slim majority - could keep a compromise bill from becoming law.\n\nA Gallup survey released in November found growing opposition to Ukraine aid among U.S. voters, with 62% of Republicans saying the United States is doing \"too much\" to help Kyiv. Florian Justwan, an associate professor of political science at the University of Idaho who studies attitudes towards international conflict, said there is no reliable polling on Idahoans' support for Ukraine.\n\nRep. Russ Fulcher, a Republican who represents North Idaho and areas west of Boise, said his constituents overwhelmingly oppose sending more of their tax dollars to Ukraine's war effort. But the House lawmaker said he would sit down with Risch to \"compare notes\" before taking a vote on a potential aid package.\n\n\"We both speak Idahoan, and what that means to me is I can trust what he's got to say, because I know his base thought process, which is very similar to mine,\" Fulcher said. \"We probably are different on (Ukraine aid), but I very much respect where he's coming from, and I intend on seeking his counsel before making the next major decision here.\"\n\nSen. Maria Cantwell, a Washington Democrat who praised Risch's foreign policy work while acknowledging their differences on many other issues, said she didn't expect the Idaho senator to play an active role in convincing GOP holdouts to back Ukraine.\n\n\"I don't think that's his style,\" Cantwell said. \"His style is to put out the right value message.\"\n\nSen. J.D. Vance of Ohio, a vocal GOP skeptic of further aid to Kyiv who has argued that Ukraine should cede territory to Russia to end the war, said he respects Risch's right to listen to Idahoans and still come to a different conclusion.\n\n\"The only way for the Republican form of government to actually work is if people take input from their constituents, they listen to them, but they have to ultimately make their own decision,\" Vance said.\n\n\"In the many conversations we've had about Ukraine, I've never said, 'You should agree with me because my view is now popular. In the same way, I would have been insulted if he would have told me 18 months ago, 'You have to agree with me because my view is popular.' So I think that he's doing this the right way, even though I think he's wrong on the substance.\"\n\nSen. Chris Coons - a Delaware Democrat who made the trip to Halifax and called Risch \"hardworking, well -informed, tireless and responsive\" - said Risch had recently told him about the opposition to funding humanitarian aid that the Idaho senator was hearing from constituents.\n\n\"It was delivered under the rubric of 'Don't shoot the messenger, but you need to realize that if folks in my state are saying this, they're saying this in half the country,' \" Coons said.\n\nDuring a visit to D.C. where he met with all 100 senators on Tuesday, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy delivered the defiant message that \"Ukraine can win.\"\n\nThree days earlier, Russian President Vladimir Putin, holding a glass of champagne at an awards ceremony at the Kremlin, said Ukraine had \"no future\" because it relies on waning support from the United States and other allies. On Dec. 15, the government of Hungary's Russia-friendly Prime Minister Viktor Orban blocked $52 billion in aid to Ukraine from the European Union.\n\nJim Jones, a former chief justice of the Idaho Supreme Court, said the state GOP is heading in an extremist direction, driven by recent arrivals who have fled blue states in search of \"the white nationalist nirvana\" in Idaho.\n\nJones said he credits Risch - with whom he sometimes clashed when Risch was Senate pro tem and Jones was Idaho's attorney general in the 1980s - with supporting Ukraine despite opposition in the state.\n\n\"The really radical right-wingers, strangely enough, those people used to be the anti-communists that wanted to take Russia on,\" Jones said. \"Now, they've kind of softened. I think they like the authoritarian attitudes, the anti-gay, pro-state-church attitude that Orban and Putin and those knuckleheads espouse, and they don't see Russia as the same threat that traditional Republicans do. So there's a split in the party.\"\n\nCardin linked anti-Ukraine and pro-Russia sentiments to U.S. opposition to getting involved in the beginning of World War II, when Nazi German propaganda efforts stoked isolationist attitudes among Americans with the aim of keeping the United States neutral.\n\n\"This is an issue that may not be popular,\" he said. \"I wasn't living in the 1930s and so I can't tell you how the feeling was in this country, but I know that when a war is far away from you, you don't think about the impact it has on us. But Ukraine is the front line of democracy.\"\n\nThat idea was echoed by Oleksandra Matviichuk, a Ukrainian human rights lawyer whose organization shared the 2022 Nobel Peace Prize.\n\n\"We can see Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea are building an authoritarian coalition, so people fighting for freedom definitely should support each other,\" she wrote in an email. \"As long as Ukraine remains vulnerable, the entire Euro-Atlantic security system remains vulnerable.\"\n\nAt this pivotal moment for the global order - not just in Ukraine, but in the Middle East, the Indo-Pacific and beyond - Risch finds himself in a position he never imagined before he got to Congress in 2009, at an age when many Americans retire.\n\nJohn Sandy, who met Risch when both were students at the University of Idaho and went on to serve as his chief of staff in the governor's office and the Senate until 2019, said the senator's seemingly boundless energy helped him overcome the late start. Recalling the conversation they had when Risch got elected, Sandy said, \"You have to be very, very thoughtful and don't dive off in the deep end until you're doggone sure you can swim.\"\n\n\"He said, 'I want you to be my chief of staff,' and I literally looked at him and said, 'I don't think that's a very good idea,' \" Sandy recalled. \"And he said, 'Why?' And I said, 'Well, I don't know anything about that.' And he looked at me and he said, 'John, I don't know anything about being a U.S. senator either. It won't take us long. We'll figure this thing out.' \"\n\nReflecting on his career path in Halifax, Risch acknowledged it was \"not a natural tendency for people from Idaho.\"\n\n\"But look, here I am,\" he said. \"And Idahoans have as much equity in the national security of the United States of America as do people from California, New York, Texas and Florida.\"\n\nLater, in his D.C. office, he showed no signs of slowing down.\n\n\"The national security of the United States,\" he said, \"is like the laundry. This is never done.\"",

        "title": "'Progressive' bar association gives award to Palestinian terrorism-tied organization",
        "body": "The oldest progressive bar association in the United States is honoring a charity in Arizona revealed through a Washington Examiner investigation to share ties to Palestinian terrorism.\n\nAlliance for Global Justice, an anti-Israel nonprofit group, has come under legal and congressional scrutiny, and it has lost the ability to process credit card donations in 2023 due to its connections to the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine, a U.S.-designated terrorist organization. These revelations, however, did not deter the National Lawyers Guild, a left-wing coalition of attorneys working \"to the end that human rights and the rights of ecosystems shall be regarded as more sacred than property interests,\" from recently presenting Alliance for Global Justice with its annual award named after the late socialist legal expert Debra Evenson.\n\nBIDEN BEAT TRUMP 'CHAOS' IN 2020 -- NOW NIKKI HALEY WANTS TO DO THE SAME\n\n\"AFGJ supports locally-based grassroots organizing by sharing political analysis, mobilizing for direct action, monitoring the centers of corporate and government power, expanding channels of communication, and sharing skills and infrastructure,\" the National Lawyers Guild said on its website.\n\nThe award was also given to Costa Rica-based environmental lawyer Emily Yozell, and it underscores how self-identified progressive activist hubs remain deeply connected with entities supporting terrorism, particularly after the Hamas-led Oct. 7 attack against Israel that killed more than 1,200 people in the Jewish state. Through an arrangement known as fiscal sponsorship, AFGJ provides services such as payroll, donation processing, and human resources for anti-Israel projects, including the Samidoun Palestinian Prisoner Solidarity Network -- an Israeli-designated terrorist coalition. Samidoun has shared staffers with the Popular Front for the Liberation of Palestine.\n\nNamed after Debra Evenson, who was president of the National Lawyers Guild between 1988 and 1991 and represented the Cuban government, the \"Venceremos\" award celebrates \"outstanding international legal work, legal solidarity, international advocacy, and justice beyond borders,\" according to the National Lawyers Guild. Venceremos is Spanish for \"we will overcome\" and was the name of a Marxist Chicano group in the 1960s and 1970s in California that engaged in violence with the goal of overthrowing the U.S. government.\n\nIt has been a rough year for Alliance for Global Justice, which has been dropped by four payment processors, PayPal, Stripe, Deluxe, and Salsa Labs, due to the companies' concerns about the charity's ties to terrorism. Moreover, some of the most influential liberal grantmakers have pledged they will no longer donate to the nonprofit group in the future. Those include New Venture Fund, Windward Fund, the Ford Foundation, and the League of Conservation Voters, among others.\n\nSamidoun, the Israeli-designated terrorist coalition housed under AFGJ, has been organizing pro-Hamas protests after Oct. 7 and was recently slapped with a ban in Germany because its activists reportedly dished out candy to Berlin protesters to celebrate Palestinian terrorism.\n\nCollectif Palestine Vaincra, a French group that partners with the PFLP, is also in Samidoun's coalition. In January, the pro-Israel Zachor Legal Institute think tank accused AFGJ in an IRS complaint of providing \"material support\" to terrorism in violation of federal law over the Arizona group fundraising for Collectif Palestine Vaincra, the Washington Examiner reported.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nOver the years, AFGJ has received large checks from the George Soros-backed dark money philanthropy network, Tides Foundation, the Tides Center, Raikes Foundation, Planned Parenthood, and even Vijaya Gadde, an ex-Twitter executive who has come under fire for playing a role in the suppression of the Hunter Biden laptop story.\n\nThe National Lawyers Guild did not return a request for comment.",

        "body": "Automaker Nissan expands research ties in China as part of bid to regain market share\n\nBEIJING (AP) -- Nissan Motor Co. is expanding its research ties with a leading Chinese university as it and other foreign car companies try to claw back market share in the important Chinese market. The Japanese automaker announced Sunday that it would launch joint research next year with Tsinghua University on reaching Generation Z and the social responsibility of automakers in battery recycling, charging stations and other electric vehicle-related issues. The major auto companies were caught flat-footed by a boom in electric vehicles in China that has given rise to new Chinese competitors that have gobbled up market share.\n\nElectric vehicles owners and solar rooftops find mutual attraction\n\nResidential solar is gaining traction in the U.S., with about 4.5 million homes now with solar rooftops. The share of electric vehicles in the U.S. is also growing. Many people with EVs become interested in charging them on solar energy, if they own their own roofs. And many people with solar end up buying electric cars. Solar is still a costly upfront investment, but people save money over time, and the initial cost is coming down, especially with federal and state incentives.\n\nActivision Blizzard to pay $54 million to settle California state workplace discrimination claims\n\nLOS ANGELES (AP) -- Activision Blizzard has agreed to pay about $54 million to settle discrimination claims brought by California's civil rights agency on behalf of women employed by the video game maker. The California Civil Rights Department announced Friday that the settlement resolves allegations that the maker of Call of Duty, Overwatch, World of Warcraft and other video games \"discriminated against women at the company, including denying promotion opportunities and paying them less than men for doing substantially similar work.\" Allegations of workplace discrimination helped drag down Activision's stock price in 2021. That paved the way for Microsoft to buy the company.\n\nFederal Reserve on cusp of what some thought impossible: Defeating inflation without steep recession\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- It was the most painful inflation Americans had experienced since 1981, when \"The Dukes of Hazzard\" and \"The Jeffersons\" were topping the TV charts. Yet the Federal Reserve now seems on the verge of defeating it -- and without the surge in unemployment and the deep recession that many economists had predicted would accompany it. Inflation has been falling more or less steadily since peaking in June of last year at 9.1%. And when the Fed's preferred inflation gauge for November is reported next week, it's likely to show that in the past six months, annual inflation actually dipped just below the Fed's elusive target of 2%, economists at UBS estimate.\n\nUS and Britain say their navies shot down 15 attack drones over the Red Sea\n\nLONDON (AP) -- The British and American militaries say that a U.S. warship has shot down 14 suspected attack drones over the Red Sea and a Royal Navy destroyer downed another drone that was targeting commercial ships. Houthi rebels in Yemen have launched a series of attacks on vessels in the Red Sea. The body of water is one of the world's busiest shipping routes. The Houthis have launched drones and missiles targeting Israel as the Israel-Hamas war threatens to spread. U.S. Central Command said Saturday that the destroyer USS Carney \"successfully engaged 14 unmanned aerial systems\" launched from Houthi-controlled areas of Yemen. U.K. Defense Secretary Grant Shapps said that HMS Diamond fired a Sea Viper missile and destroyed a drone that was \"targeting merchant shipping.\"\n\nKuwait's ruling emir, Sheikh Nawaf Al Ahmad Al Sabah, dies at age 86\n\nDUBAI, United Arab Emirates (AP) -- Kuwait's ruling emir has died at age 86. State television reported Sheikh Nawaf Al Ahmad Al Sabah's death on Saturday. Kuwait TV broke into programming with Quranic verses just before making the announcement. Sheikh Nawaf was rushed to a hospital in late November for an unclear illness. The tiny and oil-rich nation had been waiting for news about his health in the time since. State-run news previously reported that he traveled to the United States for unspecified medical checks in March 2021. The health of Kuwait's leaders remains a sensitive matter in the tiny Middle Eastern nation bordering Iraq and Saudi Arabia. Kuwait has seen internal power struggles behind palace doors.\n\nAlex Jones offers to pay Newtown families at least $55 million over school shooting hoax conspiracy\n\nConspiracy theorist Alex Jones' latest bankruptcy plan would pay Sandy Hook families a minimum total of $55 million over 10 years. That's a fraction of the $1.5 billion awarded to the relatives in lawsuits against Jones for calling the 2012 Newtown school shooting a hoax. The families, meanwhile, have filed their own proposal seeking to liquidate nearly all of Jones' assets, including his media company Free Speech Systems, and give the proceeds to them and other creditors. The dueling plans were filed late Friday in bankruptcy court. Hearings scheduled for February will determine how much Jones will have to pay out. Twenty children and six educators were killed in the Connecticut school shooting.\n\nRussia and Ukraine exchange drone attacks after European Union funding stalled\n\nKYIV, Ukraine (AP) -- Both Russia and Ukraine have reported dozens of attempted drone attacks in the past day. Ukraine's air force said Saturday that Ukrainian air defense had shot down 30 out of 31 drones launched overnight against 11 regions of the country. Russia also said Friday evening that it had thwarted a series of Ukrainian drone attacks. Russian anti-aircraft units destroyed 32 Ukrainian drones over the Crimean Peninsula and six in the Kursk region bordering Ukraine. A Russia-installed governor in Ukraine's partially occupied southern Kherson region reported on Telegram that at least 15 aerial targets had been downed. The attacks began hours after Hungary vetoed 50 billion euros of European Union funding to Ukraine.\n\nThe leaders of Italy, the UK and Albania meet in Rome to hold talks on migration\n\nROME (AP) -- The leaders of Italy and the U.K. have agreed to tackle irregular migration to Europe. They pledged to intensify cooperation in the fight against human trafficking. Italian Premier Giorgia Meloni and U.K. Prime Minister Rishi Sunak held talks in Rome on Saturday. They were also joined by Albanian counterpart Edi Rama. He is seen as a key ally in the efforts to manage migrant arrivals from North Africa to European shores.\n\nCongressional Budget Office projects lower inflation and higher unemployment into 2025\n\nWASHINGTON (AP) -- The Congressional Budget Office says it expects inflation to nearly hit the Federal Reserve's 2% target rate in 2024, as overall growth is expected to slow and unemployment is expected to rise into 2025, according to updated economic projections for the next two years. The office's Current View of the Economy from 2023 to 2025 report, released Friday, estimates that the unemployment rate will hit 4.4% in the fourth quarter of 2024 and remain close to that level through 2025. Compared with its February 2023 projections, CBO's Friday report predicts weaker growth and lower unemployment.",

        "title": "Sunday Negotiations Extend Hopes of Border Security Deal",
        "body": "Senate negotiators devoted their weekend to intense discussions on border security changes, resulting in progress but no immediate agreement. The group, composed of Senators Kyrsten Sinema, Chris Murphy, and James Lankford, engaged in a two-hour meeting with administration officials and leadership aides. Their focus was to find a compromise on border security, which would then pave the way for broader aid packages for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan.\n\nWhile no deal was reached during Saturday's talks, all participants expressed optimism and committed to continuing discussions throughout the weekend. The negotiators acknowledged the complexity and interdependence of immigration law, emphasizing the need for sufficient time to draft and assess the proposed text. As a result, the senators and their staff plan to work diligently but will reconvene only on Sunday afternoon.\n\nIn order to ensure an efficient legislative process, the negotiators highlighted the importance of establishing a workable framework before the weekend's end. They emphasized that rushing through a bill without allowing individuals and parties to thoroughly review it would be counterproductive and risk unintended consequences. A strong consensus emerged that time and careful consideration are essential to address the intricate nature of immigration law.\n\nSen. Sinema, expressing her satisfaction with the progress made, recognized the immense complexity of this aspect of American law. She emphasized the collaborative effort of those involved in finding practical and effective solutions. While specific details were not disclosed, it is evident that the negotiators are striving to develop a comprehensive and viable plan.\n\nWhile the negotiations continue, Senator Chuck Schumer, the Majority Leader, has sent lawmakers home for the weekend, with the expectation that they will return early next week. His priority is to secure a vote on the supplemental international aid package before the forthcoming holiday break.\n\nAs the discussions unfold, it is crucial to recognize that finding common ground on border security remains a formidable challenge. The negotiations have been further complicated by Ukraine's urgent appeal for aid amidst its ongoing conflict with Russia. Despite the obstacles, the commitment and determination displayed by the senators and administration officials instill optimism for a positive outcome.\n\nQ: What is the objective of the Senate negotiations on border security?\n\nA: The goal of these negotiations is to reach a compromise on border security changes, which would then enable the passage of a more comprehensive aid package for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan.\n\nQ: What was discussed during the weekend talks?\n\nA: While specific details were not disclosed, progress was made, and all participants expressed satisfaction with the ongoing negotiations.\n\nQ: What are the challenges faced in drafting the proposed text?\n\nA: Drafting the proposed text involves complex and interconnected elements of American immigration law, requiring careful consideration and time for individual and party-wide discussions.\n\nQ: What is the timeline for reaching an agreement?\n\nA: The negotiators aim to establish a workable framework by the end of the weekend, allowing for further deliberation and a potential vote later in the week.\n\nQ: What is Senator Sinema's perspective on the negotiations?\n\nA: Senator Sinema has described herself as \"really happy\" with the progress made and emphasizes the collaborative effort to find pragmatic solutions to the challenges of American law.\n\nQ: What is Senator Schumer's plan regarding the international aid package?\n\nA: Senator Schumer intends to hold a vote on the supplemental international aid package before the holiday break, reinforcing the urgency of reaching an agreement on border security.",

        "title": "UN peacekeeping chief welcomes strong support for its far-flung operations despite 'headwinds'",
        "body": "Jean-Pierre Lacroix, the undersecretary-general for peace operations, said in an interview with The Associated Press that the biannual ministerial meeting in Ghana' s capital, Accra, earlier this month was attended by nearly 100 countries.\n\nHe said that 33 countries made pledges of 117 military and police units for the U.N.'s peacekeeping operations -- and 45 countries made more than 100 pledges related to training peacekeepers and partnerships.\n\n\"We had really a strong level of support towards peacekeeping, which is great ... and the pledges were very good,\" Lacroix said.\n\nThe number of U.N. peacekeepers and staff has fallen from more than 100,000 worldwide to 70,000 as missions have ended, some more successfully than others.\n\nThere are now 12 peacekeeping operations in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East and that number will drop again following demands by the leaders of Mali and Congo for U.N. troops to leave, complaining that the peacekeepers failed in their primary mandate to protect civilians from armed groups.\n\nThere had been concern about continuing support for U.N. peacekeeping with the unprecedented six-month withdrawal of nearly 13,000 peacekeepers from Mali ending this month, and a recent agreement on the phased withdrawal of the more than 14,000-strong force in Congo.\n\nBut Lacroix said that there was a strong recommitment to U.N. peacekeeping.\n\nDuring the Accra meeting, he said that ministers also discussed U.N. efforts to address other challenges, including increasing the number of female peacekeepers, safety and security for troops, misinformation and disinformation affecting peacekeeping operations and discipline, which includes ongoing instances of sexual exploitation and sexual violence by peacekeepers.\n\nParadoxically, he said, U.N. peacekeeping remains one of the most supported U.N. operations, but individually, peacekeeping missions face problems because of divisions among the 193 member nations -- especially among the 15 members of the U.N. Security Council who must approve and extend the mandates for peacekeeping missions.\n\nIn the list of pledges, Lacroix said, \"we probably have more than what we need.\"\n\nBut it's just the beginning of a process, he stressed, because the peacekeeping department he heads must now work with countries to turn the pledges into military and police units that can be deployed, and to start training missions.\n\nLooking ahead, Lacroix said that member states and host countries have the final say on authorizing new peacekeeping operations and extending existing missions..\n\nIn the vast majority of cases, Lacroix said that he believes peacekeeping operations provide \"added value ... even if all peacekeeping operations are facing a much more difficult environment political and security-wise -- all of them, not only in Africa.\"\n\nAs for protecting civilians which the leaders of Mali and Congo strongly criticized, Lacroix said that hundreds of thousands of civilians are protected every day by U.N. peacekeepers. And he asked what would happen if peacekeepers were removed from Cyprus or the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 war -- \"and you could say the same thing about many areas in Africa\" and elsewhere.\n\nUsually, Lacroix said, the U.N. can manage difficulties, including a degraded level of security for peacekeeping missions, host governments not being fully cooperative, and fake news about peacekeepers.\n\nBut he said that missions become exceedingly difficult to sustain or even untenable when on top of that there is extremism as in Mali, which U.N. peacekeepers aren't mandated to fight, or regional conflicts like in the Great Lakes region of Africa where its mandate only covered Congo.\n\nAs for the future of peacekeeping, Lacroix said, \"First of all, we're as strong as the unity and commitment of our member states is towards opting for multilateral solutions.\"\n\nIn Mali, where peacekeepers were ordered out, and in Sudan, where the U.N. political mission was expelled, he said, \"I think it reflects a world where basically, there is less appetite to sort of go along with the multilateral option.\"\n\nThe ministerial meeting and Lacroix's interview on Monday took place as two major wars raged, in Ukraine following Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, and the Israel-Hamas war, which began on Oct. 7.\n\nWhen there is a cessation of hostilities in both wars, Lacroix said, under one of many scenarios, there may be a need for a third-party observation mission, and he said that the U.N. has a good network of people in many countries with those capabilities.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that the mission in Sudan was a political mission, not a peacekeeping one.",

        "body": "BlackRock revises spot Bitcoin ETF to enable easier access for banks\n\nBlackRock has revised its spot Bitcoin exchange-traded fund (ETF) application to make it easier for Wall Street banks to participate by creating new shares in the fund with cash rather than just crypto. The new in-kind redemption \"prepay\" model will allow banking giants such as JPMorgan or Goldman Sachs to act as authorized participants for the fund, letting them circumvent restrictions that prevent them from holding Bitcoin or crypto directly on their balance sheets.\n\nEl Salvador's National Bitcoin Office says its $1 million Freedom Visa program has already received hundreds of inquiries since its launch on Dec. 7 and expects it to sell out before the end of 2023. Launched by the local government in partnership with stablecoin issuer Tether, the Freedom Visa is a citizenship-by-donation program that grants a residency visa and pathway to citizenship for 1,000 people willing to make a $1 million Bitcoin or Tether donation to the country. The program is limited to 1,000 slots per calendar year.\n\nThe lawyer responsible for Sam \"SBF\" Bankman-Fried's criminal trial defense has admitted that the case was \"almost impossible\" to win from the outset. During an interview, Stanford Law School professor David Mills said he recommended the legal defense of SBF admit to the allegations of witnesses and state prosecution and convince the jury that Bankman-Fried intended to save the company. Mills also disclosed that he had agreed to lend his expertise to Bankman-Fried's defense at the behest of the FTX CEO's parents, and described Bankman-Fried \"as the worst person I've ever seen do a cross-examination.\"\n\nYearn.finance is hoping arbitrage traders will return $1.4 million in funds after a multisignature scripting error resulted in a large amount of the protocol's treasury being drained. The error occurred while Yearn was converting its yVault LP-yCurve -- earned from performance fees on vault harvests -- into stablecoins on the decentralized exchange CoW Swap. Yearn suffered significant slippage when it received 779,958 DAI yVault tokens from the trade, resulting in a 63% drop in the liquidity pool value.\n\nThe United States Securities and Exchange Commission has delayed its decision on whether to approve or reject a spot Ether ETF proposed by Invesco and Galaxy Digital. The companies filed the spot ETH ETF application in September. The proposed spot crypto investment vehicle is one of many being considered by the commission, which, to date, has never approved an ETF with direct exposure to Ether, Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies.\n\n\"I'm a big fan of this stablecoin called Tether...I hold their treasuries.

In a post on X (formerly Twitter) on Dec. 14, the former CEO of exchange BitMEX said that investors have \"no excuse\" to short crypto.\n\nGoing long on crypto is the key to success as markets bet on the United States Federal Reserve lowering interest rates next year, Hayes argues. \"At this point, there is no excuse not to be long crypto,\" part of his post stated.\n\n\"How many more times must they tell you that the fiat in your pocket is a filthy piece of trash,\" he wrote. Hayes further reiterated a longstanding $1 million BTC price prediction as a result of macro tides eroding the value of national currencies.\n\nThe front end of multiple decentralized applications using Ledger's connector were compromised on Dec. 14. Ledger announced that it had fixed the problem three hours after the initial reports about the attack. Protocols affected include Zapper, SushiSwap, Phantom, Balancer and Revoke.cash, stealing at least $484,000 in digital assets. The attacker utilized a phishing exploit to gain access to the computer of a former Ledger employee. The hack sparked criticism about Ledger's security approach.\n\nThe National Vulnerability Database flagged Bitcoin's inscriptions as a cybersecurity risk on Dec. 9, calling attention to the security flaw that enabled the development of the Ordinals Protocol in 2022. According to the database records, a datacarrier limit can be bypassed by masking data as code in some Bitcoin Core and Bitcoin Knots versions. As one of its potential impacts, the vulnerability could result in large amounts of non-transactional data spamming the blockchain, potentially increasing network size and adversely affecting performance and fees.\n\nThe token of decentralized finance protocol SafeMoon has fallen 31% in five hours after the company behind it filed for bankruptcy. SafeMoon officially applied for Chapter 7 bankruptcy, also known as \"liquidation bankruptcy,\" on Dec. 14. The latest blow comes only a month after the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission charged SafeMoon and its executives with violating securities laws in what the regulator described as \"a massive fraudulent scheme.\" Several former SafeMoon supporters expressed frustration on Reddit regarding the bankruptcy, alleging they were rug-pulled by the SafeMoon developers.\n\nTerrorism & Israel-Gaza war weaponized to destroy crypto\n\nDraconian anti-crypto legislation could soon be passed to solve a terrorism funding \"crisis\" that many argue is vastly overstated.\n\nKorean crypto firm raises $140M, China's $1.4T AI sector, Huobi battle: Asia Express\n\nLine Next raises $140M, China's AI market surpasses $1.4T, Sinohope stagnates due to stuck FTX deposit, and more!\n\nJ1mmy.eth once minted 420 Bored Apes... and had NFTs worth $150M: NFT Creator\n\nNFT collector J1mmy.eth trades like Warren Buffett, his collection peaked at $150 million, and he once minted 420 Bored Apes with Pranksy.",

        "body": "In a significant declaration of intent, Pedro Sánchez wanted to start the Spanish Presidency of the Council of the European Union, on July 1, precisely in Kyiv with the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, with whom he committed to push the process for its integration into the community club in response to Vladimir Putin's Russian invasion.\n\nIn a significant declaration of intent, Pedro Sánchez wanted to start the Spanish Presidency of the Council of the European Union, on July 1, precisely in Kyiv with the President of Ukraine, Volodymyr Zelensky, with whom he committed to push the process for its integration into the community club in response to Vladimir Putin's Russian invasion. And, thanks to an unexpected coincidence, the semester of the Spanish presidency culminates with the approval of the \"historic agreement\", agreed at the last meeting of the year of the European Council held in Brussels, to open negotiations for the accession of Ukraine, and also of Moldova, to the EU.\n\n\"It is an honor that this opening of negotiations with Ukraine under the Spanish presidency has been approved\", Sánchez celebrated yesterday, in the appearance he starred in together with the presidents of the Council and the European Commission, Charles Michel and Ursula von der Leyen, that highlighted the successes of the Spanish mandate. \"What you have achieved is impressive\", Michel congratulated him. And Von der Leyen described this Spanish presidency as \"excellent\", during which more than fifty political agreements were signed.\n\nOn whether the internal political situation in Spain and the quarrel with the European People's Party in relation to the amnesty have tarnished the presidency or the leadership of Spain, as Manfred Weber said, Michel recalled that the European project is based on respect for the sovereignty of member states and trust between institutions. \"The judgments of intentions seem unfortunate to me\", he concluded. Von der Leyen, when asked about the suggestion of his party, the EPP, that the situation in Spain is as serious as in Hungary or Poland, tiptoed around and simply reminded that the Commission is \"the guardian of the treaties \" and reiterate the principle of \"trust\" in the member states. Sánchez responded by quoting a phrase from Donald Tusk, the new Polish Prime Minister, also a member of the EPP: \"The problem with flirting with the far right is that you end up thinking like them.\"\n\nWhen taking stock of the semester, Sánchez thanked the laudatory words of Michel and Von der Leyen, and called this presidency of the Council of the EU, Spain's fifth, \"very satisfactory\". \"We have obtained files, quantitatively and qualitatively very relevant\", he said. And he highlighted the reform of the electricity market as one of the \"most important milestones\" of the semester, along with others such as the laws on Critical Primary Materials, Artificial Intelligence or Nature Restoration.\n\nIn his assessment of the semester, Sánchez highlighted two major events: the July summit between the EU and the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, held in Brussels - the agreement with Mercosur could not be closed, and yes with Chile-, in addition to the meeting of the informal Council and the meeting of the European Political Community that took place in Granada, in October, in which the foundations of the new European strategic agenda were laid.\n\nThe juggling act to update the multiannual financial framework of the community club, another of the relevant folders for the semester, remained one step away, with the consensus of 26 member states, but without the inclusion of Viktor Orbán's Hungary . A hot budget issue that will have to be taken on by Belgium, which on January 1 will take over from Spain in the command of the Council of the EU.\n\nSánchez also closes the semester with the open crisis in the Middle East, due to the conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, still without prospects of being able to hold the peace conference that he wanted to promote during his tour of the region with the first Belgian minister, Alexander de Croo, in search of a political solution with the recognition of the Palestinian state. \"The Council must reflect and have a much more strategic vision on the southern neighborhood\", claimed Sánchez, for stability in the Mediterranean.\n\nThe Spanish semester is about to expire, but Sánchez stressed that he still hopes to unblock the complex migration and asylum pact, another of his big priorities, before the end of the year. And he advocated for the agreement on economic governance. \"It is very important that we start the year with new tax rules\", he said. And he also trusted to achieve the integration of Romania and Bulgaria in the Schengen area.\n\n\"We will work until the last moment of the presidency\", promised the Spanish president. And there are still two weeks left.",

        "body": "President Biden, on his inauguration day, proposed a legislation to Congress that would \"bring back humanity and American ideals to our immigration framework.\" However, nearly three years later, he is considering imposing strict immigration controls in exchange for financial support for Ukraine and Israel.\n\nThis demonstrates a significant shift in the U.S. immigration politics, with surveys indicating a growing endorsement within the President's party for border policies earlier rebuked by Democrats but supported by former President Donald Trump.\n\nMr. Biden's move could see him distancing himself from some fundamental Democratic Party principles thereby risking the disapproval of crucial segments of his primary backers, including progressives and young voters.\n\n\"You can't deny the fact that there's been a shift, in part due to the major influx of these migrants in these metropolises,\" David Axelrod, a former top aide to ex-President Barack Obama stated. \"There are constraints to where Biden can and should maneuver, but this is somewhat a bonus to take actions under the protection of this broad package that were harder to take earlier.\"",

        "title": "UN peacekeeping chief welcomes strong support for its far-flung operations despite 'headwinds'",
        "body": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations peacekeeping chief says he was very satisfied with the strong support of many countries for its far-flung operations at a recent ministerial meeting, despite \"headwinds and challenges and problems.\"\n\nJean-Pierre Lacroix, the undersecretary-general for peace operations, said in an interview with The Associated Press that the biannual ministerial meeting in Ghana' s capital, Accra, earlier this month was attended by nearly 100 countries.\n\nHe said that 33 countries made pledges of 117 military and police units for the U.N.'s peacekeeping operations -- and 45 countries made more than 100 pledges related to training peacekeepers and partnerships.\n\n\"We had really a strong level of support towards peacekeeping, which is great ... and the pledges were very good,\" Lacroix said.\n\nThe number of U.N. peacekeepers and staff has fallen from more than 100,000 worldwide to 70,000 as missions have ended, some more successfully than others.\n\nThere are now 12 peacekeeping operations in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East and that number will drop again following demands by the leaders of Mali and Congo for U.N. troops to leave, complaining that the peacekeepers failed in their primary mandate to protect civilians from armed groups.\n\nThere had been concern about continuing support for U.N. peacekeeping with the unprecedented six-month withdrawal of nearly 13,000 peacekeepers from Mali ending this month, and a recent agreement on the phased withdrawal of the more than 14,000-strong force in Congo.\n\nBut Lacroix said that there was a strong recommitment to U.N. peacekeeping.\n\nDuring the Accra meeting, he said that ministers also discussed U.N. efforts to address other challenges, including increasing the number of female peacekeepers, safety and security for troops, misinformation and disinformation affecting peacekeeping operations and discipline, which includes ongoing instances of sexual exploitation and sexual violence by peacekeepers.\n\nParadoxically, he said, U.N. peacekeeping remains one of the most supported U.N. operations, but individually, peacekeeping missions face problems because of divisions among the 193 member nations -- especially among the 15 members of the U.N. Security Council who must approve and extend the mandates for peacekeeping missions.\n\nIn the list of pledges, Lacroix said, \"we probably have more than what we need.\"\n\nBut it's just the beginning of a process, he stressed, because the peacekeeping department he heads must now work with countries to turn the pledges into military and police units that can be deployed, and to start training missions.\n\nLooking ahead, Lacroix said that member states and host countries have the final say on authorizing new peacekeeping operations and extending existing missions..\n\nIn the vast majority of cases, Lacroix said that he believes peacekeeping operations provide \"added value ... even if all peacekeeping operations are facing a much more difficult environment political and security-wise -- all of them, not only in Africa.\"\n\nAs for protecting civilians which the leaders of Mali and Congo strongly criticized, Lacroix said that hundreds of thousands of civilians are protected every day by U.N. peacekeepers. And he asked what would happen if peacekeepers were removed from Cyprus or the Golan Heights, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 war -- \"and you could say the same thing about many areas in Africa\" and elsewhere.\n\nUsually, Lacroix said, the U.N. can manage difficulties, including a degraded level of security for peacekeeping missions, host governments not being fully cooperative, and fake news about peacekeepers.\n\nBut he said that missions become exceedingly difficult to sustain or even untenable when on top of that there is extremism as in Mali, which U.N. peacekeepers aren't mandated to fight, or regional conflicts like in the Great Lakes region of Africa where its mandate only covered Congo.\n\nAs for the future of peacekeeping, Lacroix said, \"First of all, we're as strong as the unity and commitment of our member states is towards opting for multilateral solutions.\"\n\nIn Mali, where peacekeepers were ordered out, and in Sudan, where the U.N. political mission was expelled, he said, \"I think it reflects a world where basically, there is less appetite to sort of go along with the multilateral option.\"\n\nThe ministerial meeting and Lacroix's interview on Monday took place as two major wars raged, in Ukraine following Russia's full-scale invasion in February 2022, and the Israel-Hamas war, which began on Oct. 7.\n\nWhen there is a cessation of hostilities in both wars, Lacroix said, under one of many scenarios, there may be a need for a third-party observation mission, and he said that the U.N. has a good network of people in many countries with those capabilities.\n\n___\n\nThis story has been corrected to show that the mission in Sudan was a political mission, not a peacekeeping one.",

He thanked the strong show of community support during the ceremony, reflecting upon the example of the Maccabees in the face of religious persecution in Israel and America.\n\n\"In Smithtown, we are asked to step up to the plate,\" the rabbi said. \"Even when there's opposition, even when there are values that oppose our own and people that will shout us down, a Macabee steps up to the plate.\"\n\nFollowing a blessing from the rabbi and a ceremonial lighting of the menorah, the attendees were greeted with latkes and donuts in the parking lot.",

        "title": "Lee reflects on Valdosta's hot hoops start",
        "body": "VALDOSTA -- Basketball for the Valdosta Wildcats continues to impress followers of the team. The team boasted a flawless eight-game win streak until their recent game versus St. Anne-Pacelli, where they took their first loss of the season 46-58 after a close game.\n\nWhen asked what he thought contributed to such a great start to the season, Head Coach James Lee said, \"We played a really tough summer schedule, and it really prepared us for this season.\"\n\nWhen looking at the Wildcats roster, it is easy to see how Valdosta can control the games it plays. Lee contributes much of their success to the talent present on the team. Discussing some standout players, he said, \"Israel Jenrette is living up to the hype as the biggest prospect in South Georgia right now. Eric Love is taking a huge step up, as we expected, and Chase Holmes is having a really good year and a really good season.\"\n\nLee also wanted to highlight impressive stats from his team, such as Chase Holmes sitting at a 60% success rate on his three-pointers. Then there is Grant Jackson, who has three double-doubles (a single-game performance in which a player accumulates ten or more in two of the following five categories: points, rebounds, assists, steals, and blocked shots).\n\nWhen asked if the team is doing anything different this season, Lee said, \"We've really embraced everybody being high IQ guys, from the staff to the players. We're trying to improve every day, not just after games. Every day.\"\n\nCoach Lee really focuses on self-improvement and wants his team to do the same. Lee described how he regularly checks his team's screen time on Hudl (an online application used to help a team capture, analyze, and share video) to hold them accountable for improvement.\n\nThe team has an exciting schedule coming up with a lot of travel. The Wildcats will travel to Norcross on the 21st to participate in the Creek Christmas Classic Tournament. Then, on the 28th, the Wildcats will travel to Coral Springs, Florida, to join in another two-day set of games. After all that travel, the Wildcats should be in good shape to start their regional games, beginning with Richmond Hill on Jan. 5th, 2024.",

        "title": "[Catholic Caucus] The Sacred Page: Rejoice! The Readings for Gaudete Sunday!",
        "body": "Rejoice, everybody! This Sunday we light the rose-colored (not pink!) candle of the Advent wreath, as a sign of our joy that we have passed the mid-point of Advent. During this penitential season (are you practicing a small penance?) in anticipation of the coming of Our Lord, we take a break from our practices of self-denial this Sunday in order to celebrate that Christmas is drawing near!\n\nThe Readings for this Sunday are unified by the theme of rejoicing, and they provide a good meditation on the role of joy in the Christian life. Perhaps a line from the first Reading best sums up the message of the Scriptures this Sunday: \"God is the joy of my soul.\" How true this is! How often we are tempted to put something else into the \"God\" slot in that statement: \"_____________ is the joy of my soul.\" How do we fill in the blank? Money? Success? Caffeine/Alcohol/some other drug? Sex? Football? Some other sport? A hobby? This Sunday is time to rejoice for all those who put \"God\" in the blank.\n\nThe Spirit of the Lord GOD is upon me, because the LORD has anointed me; he has sent me to bring glad tidings to the poor, to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and release to the prisoners, to announce a year of favor from the LORD and a day of vindication by our God.\n\nI rejoice heartily in the LORD, in my God is the joy of my soul; for he has clothed me with a robe of salvation and wrapped me in a mantle of justice, like a bridegroom adorned with a diadem, like a bride bedecked with her jewels. As the earth brings forth its plants, and a garden makes its growth spring up, so will the Lord GOD make justice and praise spring up before all the nations.\n\nThis very famous passage is one of the well-known \"Servant Songs\" of the prophet Isaiah. In the second half of the Book of Isaiah (chs. 40-66), there are several extended poems that describe a mysterious \"servant of the LORD\" about whom wondrous things are said and predicted. Most of the Servant Songs are third-person descriptions, but Isaiah 61 is one of a few that are phrased in the first-person: that is, the Servant himself speaks.\n\nIn this passage, the Servant asserts that he has been anointed with the Spirit of the LORD God. Prophets, priests, and kings were anointed in ancient Israel. The Servant is probably all three. The combination of anointing and the reception of the Spirit calls to mind the figure of David, who was filled with the Spirit when Samuel anointed him in 1 Sam 16. David, too, was prophet (2 Sam 23:1-2), priest (Ps 110), and king. As Daniel I. Block has shown in some studies, there is good reason to understand the \"Servant\" of Isaiah as a Davidic figure, indeed, the Son of David.1\n\nThere is a purpose for which God has anointed the Servant:\n\nto bring glad tidings to the poor, to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and release to the prisoners, to announce a year of favor from the LORD and a day of vindication by our God.\n\n\"Glad tidings\" means \"good news.\" In Greek this is eu (= good) + angelia (= news). In the Septuagint, the verse reads more or less literally as \"to evangelize the poor.\"\n\n\"Proclaiming liberty to captives and release to prisoners\" calls to mind the royal proclamations of \"liberty\" that were often promulgated in the ancient Near East when a new king took the throne. These were general decrees of amnesty that effected specific oppressed classes of persons. It also calls to mind the Jubilee Year of Leviticus 25. Israel did not originally have a human king, so God gave them laws establishing a decree of liberty (deror) every fifty years, the Year of Jubilee. The phrase \"proclaim liberty\" (qara' derôr ) that Isaiah uses here is only found elsewhere in the Jubilee law of Leviticus 25:10 and in Jer 34:8-17, another passage that refers to the Jubilee. (Full disclosure: I wrote my dissertation on the biblical Jubilee. It's The Jubilee from Leviticus to Qumran, Vetus Testamentum Supplements 115; Leiden: Brill, 2007).\n\nIsaiah 61 is particularly significant, because we see that Israel's hope in the Jubilee is being combined with the hope for a coming \"anointed one\" or Messiah. The Messiah will proclaim the Jubilee Year, the \"year of the LORD's favor.\" Will this mean an economic restructuring of society? In time, devout Israelites began to realize their real problems were not economic but spiritual. There was a need for a \"Jubilee\" from the debt of sin more than money debts. So some holy man among the Essenes penned a famous document that scholars call \"11QMelchizedek\", a Dead Sea Scroll that contains a prophecy of the return of a messianic \"Melchizedek\" who, in fulfillment of Isaiah 61:1-2, would proclaim a Jubilee Year to forgive sins. Now we understand why it generated so much excitement when Jesus went to the Synagogue of Nazareth, read Isaiah 61:1-2, and preached: \"Today this Scripture is fulfilled in your hearing!\" Jesus was identifying himself with the \"servant of the LORD\" whom the Essenes assimilated to the figure of Melchizedek the priest-king.\n\nYou may wonder why the text combines these two seemingly antithetical images: \"A year of favor ... a day of vindication/vengeance.\" This reflects the two different roles of the go'el or \"redeemer.\" A \"redeemer\" was a close male relative who, on the one hand, was supposed to come and show kindness to you when you got yourself in trouble (like buying back out of slavery, see Lev 25), or, on the other hand, would avenge/vindicate your life by punishing whoever had killed you (see Num 35). Relief for the victim, punishment for the victimizer: this was the duty of the go'el , the \"Redeemer.\" This word occurs more often in Leviticus and Isaiah than any other Biblical books. Isaiah is unique for how often it refers to God as the go'el , \"Redeemer.\"\n\nOur First Reading skips several verses before picking up with what appears to be another \"song\" in the mouth of the Servant near the end of Isaiah 61 (vv. 10-11):\n\nI rejoice heartily in the LORD, in my God is the joy of my soul; for he has clothed me with a robe of salvation and wrapped me in a mantle of justice, like a bridegroom adorned with a diadem, like a bride bedecked with her jewels. As the earth brings forth its plants, and a garden makes its growth spring up, so will the Lord GOD make justice and praise spring up before all the nations.\n\nHere the servant describes himself in royal terminology (\"robe of salvation\"/\"mantle of justice\") and also nuptial imagery (\"like a bridegroom ... like a bride\") and even new creation/Edenic images (\"a garden springs up\"). The \"Servant\" is filled with joy to be the object of God's favor. All those who have been baptized into Jesus, and thus have become one body with him, can take these same words on our lips! God has been truly good to us! So what if there are problems of various sorts: health, money, political issues, etc. Our happiness is not in those things! \"In my God is the joy of my soul!\"\n\n2. In keeping with this theme of joy, the Responsorial Psalm is Our Lady's \"Magnificat,\" Luke 1:46-48, 49-50, 53-54:\n\nHere we see that Mary is adopting the attitude and posture of the Servant of the LORD in Isa 61:1-2. How can she do this? Isn't the \"Servant of the LORD\" Jesus Himself? Yes, but the Blessed Mother has Jesus in her womb. She is the first Christian, the first person to be united as one flesh with Jesus. So what is true of Jesus, is true of her by extension. She is taken up into the Messianic mission of Christ, to \"proclaim good news ... and liberty,\" and to find in God the \"joy of her soul.\" Mary speaks as if God has already established \"justice\" through his Messiah: filling the oppressed \"hungry\" with good things (think of the feeding miracles) and sending the rich oppressors away empty (think of the rich young ruler (Matt 21:22). Like the prophets of old, she speaks as if these things have already taken place, although in fact God has only begun to act in historical time.\n\nBut we, in Mass, take up Mary's words as our own. What is true of her, is true of the Church as a whole. God has done great things for us! He has \"filled the hungry with good things\", namely, the Eucharist. We at Mass are the spiritually hungry, those who realize they are \"poor in spirit,\" that is, having nothing good in ourselves, by ourselves. So we come to Mass to feast on God, the \"joy of our souls\"! Meanwhile, the wealthy of this world -- all the elite, the stars, the entertainers, the celebrities, the powerbrokers, those who control the media, entertainment, education, government, etc. -- turn up their collective nose at the absurdity of these \"medieval rituals\" that some still do on Sundays. Let's pray for them that they can see their poverty and join us to feast on the one Good Thing.\n\n3. Our Second Reading is from St. Paul: 1 Thessalonians 5:16-24:\n\nBrothers and sisters: Rejoice always. Pray without ceasing. In all circumstances give thanks, for this is the will of God for you in Christ Jesus. Do not quench the Spirit. Do not despise prophetic utterances. Test everything; retain what is good. Refrain from every kind of evil.\n\nMay the God of peace make you perfectly holy and may you entirely, spirit, soul, and body, be preserved blameless for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ. The one who calls you is faithful, and he will also accomplish it.\n\nRejoice always. That is the key reason this text was chosen for \"Gaudete\" or \"Rejoicing\" Sunday. How is it possible to \"rejoice always\"? Well, in order to do that, we have to develop some other habits: (1) praying all the time; (2) always giving thanks, that is, trying to see the \"silver lining\" in everything that God sends our way; (3) not quenching the Spirit, (4) respecting \"prophecy\", which would apply (among other things) to the preaching of our parish priest, and (5) refraining from evil. Learning to \"rejoice always\" is part of a larger package of a life of virtue, in which everything is inter-related. This is the \"package\" the Servant came to teach us, and this is the \"package\" that Mary lived out so well.\n\nSt. Paul prays: \"May the God of peace make you perfectly holy .... Blameless in spirit, soul, and body.\" This makes us think of Mary, whose Immaculate Conception (and immaculate life!) we celebrated earlier this week. However, we are all called to perfect holiness, even if it is difficult in this life. St. Paul says we should be blameless in \"body, soul, and spirit.\" This shows there are sins of the body (fornication, gluttony, sloth) as well as of the \"soul\" (the mind and heart: lust, avarice, wrath) and the \"spirit\" (pride, heresy, rejection of God).\n\nWe need to remain \"blameless for the coming of our Lord Jesus Christ.\" Following Christ means not just believing but actually being transformed, becoming \"blameless\" so we can stand at the final judgment. This calls to mind Advent's dual focus on the Second and First Coming of Jesus. We want to keep our sight on both horizons. Waiting for the liturgical coming of Christ (Christmas) recalls his First Coming and looks forward to his Second.\n\nA man named John was sent from God. He came for testimony, to testify to the light, so that all might believe through him. He was not the light, but came to testify to the light.\n\nAnd this is the testimony of John. When the Jews from Jerusalem sent priests and Levites to him to ask him, \"Who are you?\" He admitted and did not deny it, but admitted, \"I am not the Christ.\" So they asked him, \"What are you then? Are you Elijah?\" And he said, \"I am not.\" \"Are you the Prophet?\" He answered, \"No.\" So they said to him, \"Who are you, so we can give an answer to those who sent us? What do you have to say for yourself?\" He said:\n\n\"I am the voice of one crying out in the desert,\n\n'make straight the way of the Lord,'\"\n\nas Isaiah the prophet said.\"\n\nSome Pharisees were also sent. They asked him, \"Why then do you baptize if you are not the Christ or Elijah or the Prophet?\" John answered them, \"I baptize with water; but there is one among you whom you do not recognize, the one who is coming after me, whose sandal strap I am not worthy to untie.\" This happened in Bethany across the Jordan, where John was baptizing.\n\nJohn the Baptist figures prominently during the season of Advent, because he announced the coming of Jesus. Weeks 2 and 3 of Advent often have Gospel texts reflecting on his ministry.\n\nA little background helps to make this Gospel a little clearer. John the Baptist was causing a stir by performing a spiritual water-washing ritual on people in the Jordan River. This smacked of some kind of end-times preparation, because various prophets, notably Ezekiel (Ezek 36:25ff) had spoken of an end-times water-washing associated with the new age that God would usher in. Moreover, John the Baptist was walking around dressed like Elijah, with a hair shirt and leather belt (2 Kings 1:8). Who did he think he was? The religious leaders from Jerusalem send messengers to find out. There were at least three figures the Judeans expected to come at the end of the age:\n\n(1) The Messiah or \"Anointed One\" predicted by the prophets (Isa 61, Dan 9, etc);\n\n(2) Elijah himself, whom Malachi prophesied would return before the \"Day of the LORD\" (Mal 4:5); and\n\n(3) \"The Prophet,\" that is, the prophet like Moses, whom Moses predicted would come some day (see Deut 18:15ff).\n\nSo the messengers from Jerusalem come with clip boards and lists of \"end times figures,\" to check the box by the one with whom John the Baptist identifies himself. But they have to cross off all their boxes! \"I'm none of these,\" John says. Who is he, then? \"I am the voice of one crying in the wilderness...\" This is a quote from Isaiah 40, a famous chapter that serves as an introduction the long vision of the age of the messiah that is Isaiah 40-66. So John is an introduction incarnate, a prologue in person, a foreword in the flesh.\n\nJohn points to someone greater. He is not the Servant of the LORD of Isaiah 61: Jesus will be that. His job is to point to the Servant. In a sense, that's our job as Christians, too: to point to God's Servant, Jesus.\n\nSome may wonder, \"Why doesn't John say he is Elijah? Other texts identify him as such (see Matt 11:14; 17:12; Mark 9:12-13.)\" The reason is, the Judeans are wondering if John is Elijah raised from the dead. And he isn't, so he says, \"No.\" But is he the one spoken of as \"Elijah\" in the prophets? Yes. Gabriel, in Luke 1:17, clarifies: \"he will go before him in the spirit and power of Elijah.\" John had the Elijianic charism, similar to the way some Franciscans strongly bear the charism of St. Francis.\n\nJohn comes to \"make straight the way of the Lord.\" In Isaiah 40, this \"Lord\" is the LORD, in other words, the divine name. John has come to make straight the way for YHWH the God of Israel. But I thought he was to prepare for someone who would wear sandals, that is, a human being? Yes. Jesus is YHWH. This is indicating Christ's divinity.\n\nSo what do we do this Sunday? We rejoice! God has seen our poverty, and he is sending (has sent!) us his Servant to feed our hungry souls with Himself, and to teach us that in God is joy! Let's stay humble, like the Blessed Virgin and John the Baptist, and keep our fingers pointed to Jesus, telling others about Him!\n\n1 See Daniel I.

        "body": "When it comes to large natural colored and D-flawless diamonds, the name Rahaminov immediately comes to mind. A family-owned business with an 80-year legacy, the company continues to provide consumers, collectors and connoisseurs with an unparalleled collection of rare cuts and colors, which include large pear-shaped natural yellow, rare cushion-shaped natural pink and round or fancy cut white diamonds, among many others. Due to similar values, Rahaminov Diamonds' fine jewelry collections will now be featured in some of the renowned Bucherer retail network's boutiques, which include one store in New York City and 17 other shops throughout the United States.\n\nRahaminov Diamonds' platinum and 18K yellow gold ring with a fancy intense yellow diamond center and two trapezoid cut side diamonds.\n\nAfter being owned by the Bucherer family for three generations, in August 2023, Rolex acquired the company to evolve it and work with different heritage companies such as Rahaminov.\n\nRahaminov Diamonds' 18K Pink and White Lariat necklace with fancy brownish pink diamond and white diamond pear shape drops accented with round fancy pink and white diamond melee.\n\nAmir Goldfiner, Rahaminov Diamonds President, said over the phone, \"We are excited to partner with such a revered retailer as Bucherer.

The torch was passed in the 1980s to Tamara Rahaminov and her husband, Amir Goldfiner, who further built the company's prestige and reputation by opening a Los Angeles-based office and transforming Rhaminov into a luxury brand. Today, the third generation, represented by daughters Nicol and Melanie Goldfiner, have imbued the family business with a relevant and modern slant, yet never straying too far from the company's motto of \"where the diamond inspires the design.\" They have taken those words to heart, creating a collection of jewelry that starts with finding the most genuinely unique fancy cuts with character and presence and then designing around the stones. Each piece is crafted in platinum and/or 18K gold and focuses on one jaw-dropping diamond or awe-inspiring configurations of the different cuts and colors..\n\nRahaminov Diamonds' 18K rose gold and platinum ring with radiant cut fancy green-blue center stone with fancy intense pink trillion cut diamond sides and fancy pink diamond melee.\n\nBucherer, founded in Lucerne in 1888, has one of the most distinguished reputations in the watch and jewelry industry in Europe. In addition to its impressive range of luxury timepieces and exquisite jewelry from renowned brands, Bucherer offers its customers its own exclusive Bucherer Fine Jewellery collection and Carl F.

The company features over 36 exclusive European retail locations, including a flagship boutique in Vienna and Paris and retail stores that count fifteen in Switzerland, twelve in Germany, three in Copenhagen and four boutiques in London. By acquiring the American luxury watch dealer Tourneau in 2018, Bucherer established itself as the world's largest watch and jewelry company in the U.S. and Europe.\n\nTogether, the two companies represent six generations of luxury jewels.",

        "title": "Sánchez adds to his balance of the European semester the open door to Ukraine",
        "body": "In a significant declaration of intentions, Pedro Sánchez wanted to begin the Spanish presidency of the Council of the European Union, on July 1, precisely in Kyiv together with the president of Ukraine, Volodímir Zelensky, before whom he promised to promote the process. for integration into the community club in response to Vladimir Putin's Russian invasion. And, thanks to an unexpected coincidence, the semester of the Spanish presidency culminates with the approval of the \"historic agreement\", reached at the last meeting of the year of the European Council held in Brussels, to open negotiations for the accession of Ukraine, and also Moldova, to the EU.\n\n\"It is an honor that this opening of negotiations with Ukraine is approved under the Spanish presidency,\" Sánchez celebrated yesterday, in the appearance he starred in alongside the presidents of the Council and the European Commission, Charles Michel and Ursula von der Leyen, respectively, who They highlighted the achievements of the Spanish mandate. \"What you have achieved is impressive,\" Michel congratulated him. And Von der Leyen described this Spanish presidency as \"excellent\", during which more than fifty political agreements were signed.\n\nAsked if the internal political situation in Spain and the scuffle with the European People's Party over the amnesty law have tarnished the presidency or the leadership of Spain, as Manfred Weber suggested, Michel recalled that the European project is based on respect for the sovereignty of the member states and trust between their institutions. \"The judgments of intentions seem regrettable to me,\" he concluded. Von der Leyen, for her part, asked about the suggestion of her party, the EPP, that the situation in Spain is as serious as in Hungary or Poland, put herself in profile and limited herself to remembering that the Commission is \"the guardian of the treaties\" and reiterate the principle of \"trust\" in the member states. Sánchez responded by quoting a phrase from Donald Tusk, the new Polish Prime Minister, also a member of the EPP: \"The problem with flirting with the extreme right is that you end up thinking like them.\"\n\nTaking stock of the semester, Sánchez thanked Michel and Von der Leyen for their praiseworthy words, and described this current presidency of the EU Council, the fifth that Spain has assumed, as \"very satisfactory.\" \"We have achieved very relevant files, both quantitatively and qualitatively,\" he congratulated himself. And he highlighted the reform of the electricity market as one of the \"most important milestones\" of the semester, along with other approved initiatives, such as the laws on Critical Raw Materials, Artificial Intelligence or Nature Restoration.\n\nIn his assessment of the semester, Sánchez highlighted two major events: the July summit between the EU and the countries of Latin America and the Caribbean, held in Brussels - the agreement with Mercosur could not be concluded, but it was with Chile -, in addition to the meeting of the informal Council and the meeting of the European Political Community that took place in Granada, in October, where the foundations of the new European strategic agenda were laid.\n\nThe \"tweaking\" to update the multi-annual financial framework of the community club, another of the relevant folders for the semester, was a mere breath away, with the consensus of up to 26 of the member states, but in the absence of the incorporation of the Hungary by Viktor Orbán. A budgetary hot potato that will already have to be assumed by Belgium, which on January 1 will take over from Spain at the helm of the EU Council.\n\nSánchez also closes the semester with the open crisis in the Middle East, due to the conflict between Israel and Hamas in Gaza, with no prospects yet of being able to hold the peace conference that he wanted to promote during his tour of the region with the Belgian Prime Minister, Alexander de Croo, in search of a political solution with the recognition of the Palestinian State. \"The Council has to reflect and have a much more strategic vision about the southern neighborhood,\" Sánchez claimed, for stability in the Mediterranean.\n\nThe Spanish semester is about to expire, but Sánchez highlighted yesterday that he still hopes to unblock the complex migration and asylum pact, another of his great priorities, before the end of the year. And he also opted to achieve agreement on economic governance. \"It is very important that we start next year with new fiscal rules,\" he urged. And he also hoped to achieve the integration of Romania and Bulgaria into the Schengen area.\n\n\"We are going to work until the last moment of the presidency,\" the Spanish president promised. And there are still two weeks left.",

        "body": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations peacekeeping chief says he was very satisfied with the strong support of many countries for its far-flung operations at a recent ministerial meeting, despite \"headwinds and challenges and problems.\"\n\nJean-Pierre Lacroix, the undersecretary-general for peace operations, said in an interview with The Associated Press that the bi-annual ministerial meeting in Ghana' s capital, Accra, earlier this month was attended by nearly 100 countries.\n\nHe said 33 countries made pledges of 117 military and police units for the U.N.'s peacekeeping operations - and 45 countries made over 100 pledges related to training peacekeepers and partnerships.\n\n\"We had really a strong level of support towards peacekeeping, which is great ... and the pledges were very good,\" Lacroix said.\n\nThe number of U.N. peacekeepers and staff has fallen from over 100,000 worldwide to 70,000 as missions have ended, some more successfully than others.\n\nThere are now 12 peacekeeping operations in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East and that number will drop again following demands by the leaders of Mali and Congo for U.N. troops to leave, complaining that the peacekeepers failed in their primary mandate to protect civilians from armed groups.\n\nThere had been concern about continuing support for U.N. peacekeeping with the unprecedented six-month withdrawal of nearly 13,000 peacekeepers from Mali ending this month, and a recent agreement on the phased withdrawal of the more than 14,000-strong force in Congo.\n\nBut Lacroix said there was a strong recommitment to U.N. peacekeeping.\n\nDuring the Accra meeting, he said ministers also discussed U.N. efforts to address other challenges including increasing the number of women peacekeepers, safety and security for troops, misinformation and disinformation affecting peacekeeping operations and discipline, which includes ongoing instances of sexual exploitation and sexual violence by peacekeepers.\n\nParadoxically, he said, U.N. peacekeeping remains one of the most supported U.N. operations, but individually peacekeeping missions face problems because of divisions among the 193 member nations -- especially among the 15 members of the U.N. Security Council who must approve and extend the mandates for peacekeeping missions.\n\nIn the list of pledges, Lacroix said, \"we probably have more than what we need.\"\n\nBut it's just the beginning of a process, he stressed, because the peacekeeping department he heads must now work with countries to turn the pledges into military and police units that can be deployed, and to start training missions.\n\nLooking ahead, Lacroix said member states and host countries have the final say on authorizing new peacekeeping operations and extending existing missions..\n\nIn the vast majority of cases, Lacroix said he believes peacekeeping operations provide \"added value ... even if all peacekeeping operations are facing a much more difficult environment political and security-wise -- all of them, not only in Africa.\"\n\nAs for protecting civilians which the leaders of Mali and Congo strongly criticized, Lacroix said hundreds of thousands of civilians are protected every day by U.N. peacekeepers. And he asked what would happen if peacekeepers were removed from Cyprus or the Golan Heights which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 war -- \"and you could say the same thing about many areas in Africa\" and elsewhere.\n\nUsually, Lacroix said, the U.N. can manage difficulties including a degraded level of security for peacekeeping missions, host governments not fully cooperative, and fake news about peacekeepers.\n\nBut he said missions becomes exceedingly difficult to sustain or even untenable when on top of that you have terrorism as in Mali, which U.N. peacekeepers are not mandated to fight, or regional conflicts like in the Great Lakes region of Africa where its mandate only covered Congo.\n\nAs for the future of peacekeeping, Lacroix said, \"First of all, we're as strong as the unity and commitment of our member states is towards opting for multilateral solutions.\"\n\nIn Mali and Sudan, where peacekeepers were also expelled, he said, \"I think it reflects a world where basically, there is less appetite to sort of go along with the multilateral option.\"\n\nThe ministerial meeting and Lacroix's interview this week (Monday) took place as two major wars raged, in Ukraine following Russia's February 2022 invasion, and in Gaza following Hamas' surprise attacks inside Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nWhen there is a cessation of hostilities in both wars, Lacroix said, under one of many scenarios there may be a need for a third-party observation mission, and he said the U.N. has a good network of people in many countries with those capabilities.",

        "body": "A Mexican tradition aims to bring immigrants from across Morgan County together Sunday.\n\nThe American Friends Service Committee (AFSC), a Quaker organization that has been working on immigration issues for over a century, is holding a vigil, posada and December party for family, friends and members of the community. The celebration begins at 4 p.m. Sunday at the Dahms-Talton Bandshell at Glenn Miller Park in downtown Fort Morgan. The vigil will be followed by a procession down Main to the OneMorgan County office, where guests can enjoy music, food, folk dancing and piñatas.\n\nThe event is part of a week of action organized by AFSC to urge politicians to protect the human rights of people seeking safety. During the Fort Morgan event, guests will be able to sign a giant card for Sen. Michael Bennet and Congressman Ken Buck.\n\n\"Every day I meet newcomers to Fort Morgan and am reminded of my own journey to residency here in the United State. We connect them to resources and welcome them to our family, helping them to navigate the complexity of a new country and making sure they understand the complexity of their legal proceedings. Together, our members are building healthy networks of support and breaking down barriers for themselves and their loved ones,\" said Guadalupe Lopez Chavez, organizer with the Fort Morgan program of the AFSC.\n\n\"At this moment President Biden and Senate Republicans are attempting to make drastic changes that would eviscerate the United States' commitment to be a place of safety and hope by essentially ending asylum. It's a callous move. Instead of focusing efforts to find $105 billion to welcome and integrate newcomers, or to meet the human needs of all residents of the US (health access, affordable housing, new jobs) Senator Bennet is pressuring Congress to trade away the lives of people seeking safety for bombs and war and more deadly separation walls at our border with Mexico. We ask him to focus on humanitarian aide and peace so people aren't forced to migrate at all.\"\n\nLas Posadas is a Mexican celebration that retells the story of Mary and Joseph searching for shelter for Mary to give birth to Jesus. People open their homes as stops in neighborhoods and community and share food. Mary and Joseph are denied shelter three times, by strangers and kin, with different excuses before the innkeeper allows them access to his stable.\n\nIn the U.S., the posada has become a symbol of the migrant journey and the welcome or rejection by community. The story also demonstrates the dignity and determination with which immigrants navigate the challenges of a new place.\n\nFrom Dec. 10 - International Human Rights Day - through Dec. 18 - International Migrants Day - protests, vigils, and events will take place across the country. The actions will lift up the demand for human rights for migrants and celebrate the connectedness and solidarity of immigrants and allies in the U.S. and around the world. For a complete list of events, see https://afsc.org/human-rights-december-2023-week-action.\n\nEvents are also taking place in Florida, New Hampshire, New York, New Jersey, and at the U.S.-Mexico border and an online webinar, \"From Palestine to Mexico: How Palestine and the U.S. Immigrant Industrial Complex Are Connected.",

        "title": "How investors can work with stakeholders to reimagine capitalism",
        "body": "By Elena Botella, Principal, Reimagining Capitalism\n\nInvestors have power to shape how corporations act, which is why when we launched our Corporations, Capital Markets and the Common Good strategy, we chose to focus on investment stewardship -- the ability of shareholders to influence the behaviors of corporations through dialogue, proxy voting, and board elections.\n\nWe know that businesses are so much more than people at the top and those who bank the profits. They require skilled workers to produce goods, informed consumers to buy them, and strong communities in which to grow. We believe all of these actors need to share power in the corporation and receive a fair share of value that they help to generate. Our partners sometimes call this idea stakeholder capitalism -- and it stands in opposition to shareholder primacy, the idea that companies should exist purely to maximize investor profits, regardless of the costs to society.\n\nAnd yet, we think there is huge untapped potential for investment stewardship to change our economy for better, not as a substitute for stakeholder capitalism, but as a part of a broader system of checks and balances. Only a small fraction of people identify with the term \"investor.\" And yet, the small amount of savings owned by many middle-class people add up to large proportions of the stock market as a whole.\n\nWe believe investment stewardship can push Wall Street and corporations to better serve the interests of working- and middle-class families.\n\nSeeing the full picture of the challenges we face\n\nAddressing the climate crisis is essential: corporations and investors can either be a part of the problem, or a part of the solution. Investors concerned about the climate crisis have made front-page headlines in the past few years, most notably, in 2021, when a majority of shareholders ousted three Exxon board members, calling on the company to think more critically before launching new drilling projects.\n\nBut the climate crisis is just one of the major challenges our world faces.\n\nFor instance, our partners Shareholder Commons and the Finance for Environmental and Social Systemic Change Centre at Cambridge have educated corporations and investors about what will happen if the companies in the meat industry continue to overuse antibiotics. Already, antimicrobial resistance is estimated to cause more than one million deaths annually. Without action, estimates suggest the financial cost in 2054 could be as high as $125 trillion. Investors should be highly motivated to take action -- not only to protect the health of people around the globe, but also to protect their own portfolio's rate of return. In 2021, Shareholder Commons reached a voluntary agreement with Yum! Brands regarding antimicrobial resistance, and in 2023, their work was recognized by the Financial Times editorial board in an article entitled \"Investors Can Play Their Part In The Role On Super Bugs.\"\n\nClimate and public health are just a few of the issue areas where investors can, and must, make a difference. Over the past two years, many of our partners have been part of achieving major milestones, including the first successful shareholder votes calling for companies to conduct racial equity audits and protect the right of workers to organize.\n\nThe need for stakeholder partnerships\n\nAs the field of investment stewardship has evolved, we've seen that shareholders can't fully understand the risks or impacts of corporations through data alone. The people who work at a corporation, use the corporation's products, and live in a corporation's footprint all possess critical information about what's going well and what needs to change.\n\nThe 2023 Norfolk Southern train derailment in East Palestine, Ohio clearly illustrates why stakeholder voice is so important. For years, transportation trade workers rang the alarm bell about the safety and environmental risks associated with \"precision scheduled railroading.\" Ultimately, the East Palestine derailment would dump more than a million tons of hazardous chemicals in Ohio; Norfolk Southern's short-term cost cutting led to irrevocable harm.\n\nWhat other environmental and human catastrophes could be prevented if workers and community members had more influence over corporate America, directly, and indirectly through closer relationships with investors? And just as importantly -- what opportunities for economic transformation are investors missing when they don't listen to the workers and community members who understand a business' operations on a personal level?\n\nWe've witnessed the value of organizations that connect investors with impacted communities. The Interfaith Center for Corporate Responsibility (ICCR) brings investors together with other stakeholders to understand where and how corporations are causing harm and what can be done. In 2023, ICCR investors joined forced with forces with the Walmart workers organized through United for Respect to introduce a shareholder resolution on racial equity.\n\nWe've also learned from our partner Investor Advocates for Social Justice who released guidelines in 2022 about how shareholders should collaborate with impacted communities. They've called on investors to be transparent about shareholder tools and the limits of shareholder advocacy; to be participatory, bringing impacted stakeholders directly into their conversations with corporations; and to share decision-making power so that investors and stakeholders have equal say in what the goals of engagement are and how to define a \"win.\"\n\nFinally, we think it's critical that investment staff directly engage the working people whose money is invested. In the United States and abroad, most workers who participate in pension funds are also union members. Grantees like Committee on Workers' Capital and Majority Action have forged strong partnerships with labor unions. We believe pension funds can use their power as shareholders to help change corporate America, and ultimately protect the security of their retirement savings and the future that millions of teachers, firefighters, and other union members wish to pass on to their children.\n\nThe path forward\n\nNo matter what issue your organization is focused on -- from climate change and biodiversity to public health and housing, from labor rights and racial equity to democracy -- corporations play an important role. To that end, we believe more philanthropies should consider supporting corporate change and investor oriented work as part of their broader strategy to achieve meaningful change.\n\nFinally, we've also come to recognize that corporate accountability and investor stewardship shouldn't apply just to big public companies. In our next installment of this series, we'll talk about what the rise of the private equity industry means for our economy, and how investors, grassroots organizations, civil society, and philanthropy can engage.",

Located on 10 acres full of 200-year-old pecan trees, there is a 6,000-square-foot tasting room complete with a full wine bar and ample seating. Wine slushies are a favorite among guests, and a brief but creative café menu offers items such as spinach and cheese stuffed bread, pecan-crusted chicken salad, and pork tenderloin sliders.\n\nWhat to do\n\nPrioritize a trip to Hills and Dales Estate, a beautiful 35-acre historic property that includes the Ferrell Gardens, the Fuller E. Callaway family home, and the surrounding outbuildings and landscape. The estate has a very intriguing 180-year history and underwent a major restoration project in 2010.\n\nThe Biblical History Center is a more interesting than-you-might-expect archaeological museum that explores daily life in ancient Israel. From shepherd's goat hair tents to a stone house like Jesus might have lived in, guests are immersed in a multi-sensory experience from start to finish. The museum is also home to a long-term collection of ancient artifacts, such as a 4,700-year-old game board and a 1,600-year-old early Christian oil lamp.\n\nThere are many exciting ways to get outside while in LaGrange. Catch a concert at Sweetland Amphitheatre, a 2,500-seat outdoor music venue that has drawn artists such as Blues Traveler, Gladys Knight, and Willie Nelson. For an adventure, rent a kayak and travel down the Chattahoochee for a couple of hours while taking in the West Georgia scenery. West Point Lake is also nearby -- home to ample recreational opportunities as well as bald eagles, osprey, deer, turkey, and foxes.\n\nBustling with Southern charm and about the same size as Aiken population-wise, LaGrange makes for a fun and digestible long weekend getaway for families of all types and sizes.

        "title": "Masha Gessen will receive Hannah Arendt Prize after all, following controversy over Gaza essay",
        "body": "(JTA) - The writer Masha Gessen will still receive a prestigious award named for Hannah Arendt, after the German foundation that administers the prize had initially said it would pull its support due to Gessen's recent writing on Gaza.\n\nGessen, a Jewish writer for The New Yorker magazine, published an essay last week comparing the Gaza Strip to Nazi-era Jewish ghettos, sparking backlash from Jewish and pro-Israel activists in Germany. That led the Heinrich Böll Foundation to say that it would no longer support a ceremony for Gessen receiving the award named for Arendt, a 20th-century German Jewish thinker and author.\n\nBut on Friday, the foundation told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that Gessen will still get the award, including 10,000 euros in prize money, and that the author should still be honored.\n\n\"We want to make it very clear that we do not want to strip Masha Gessen of the award, or deny them the prize, and that we honor the relevance of their work,\" the foundation said in a statement. \"Gessen deserves great merit for their unconditional commitment to democracy and to debating uncomfortable issues. We greatly appreciate Gessen's critical work, their demonstrated passion for freedom and commitment to defy any autocratic tendencies.\"\n\nThe award is given annually to political theorists who continue the philosophical tradition of Arendt. Gessen is a refugee from the former Soviet Union and the descendant of Holocaust survivors. They have been widely acclaimed for their writing on the Russia-Ukraine war and LGBTQ issues.\n\nThe foundation's initial objections, and those of the German city of Bremen that co-administers the prize, stemmed from a Dec. 9 New Yorker essay by Gessen entitled \"In The Shadow Of The Holocaust.\" In the piece, Gessen critiqued modern German, Polish and Ukrainian approaches to Holocaust memory, and also castigated Israeli policy toward Gaza.\n\n\"For the last seventeen years, Gaza has been a hyperdensely populated, impoverished, walled-in compound where only a small fraction of the population had the right to leave for even a short amount of time -- in other words, a ghetto,\" Gessen wrote. \"Not like the Jewish ghetto in Venice or an inner-city ghetto in America but like a Jewish ghetto in an Eastern European country occupied by Nazi Germany.\"\n\nThey added: \"The ghetto is being liquidated.\"\n\nFollowing the essay's publication, the German-Israeli Society's Bremen chapter criticized Gessen's comparison of Gaza to Jewish ghettos, which society chair Hermann Kuhn wrote could have \"only one explanation: a deep-seated and fundamental negative prejudice against the Jewish state.\" Kuhn also took issue with Gessen's stance on Germany's approach to the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement against Israel, which the German government has defined as antisemitic.\n\nIn an open letter calling on the prize's administrators to refrain from honoring Gessen, the society wrote that giving them the award \"would honor a person whose thinking is in clear contrast to Hannah Arendt's.\" Founding members of the prize also campaigned against Gessen receiving it due to their \"statements about the Middle East conflict,\" in a letter quoted by the German newspaper Die Zeit.\n\nSubsequently, Bremen's Senate announced it would be pulling out of a planned ceremony for the award, and the foundation said it would no longer sponsor it. But then it backtracked and attributed its decision to a lack of a venue for the ceremony. Later, on Friday, it said that it objected to Gessen's characterization of Gaza but that they should not be stripped of the award.\n\n\"We disagree with this statement, and fully reject it,\" the foundation said regarding Gessen's comparison of Gaza to a Nazi-era ghetto. \"The award ceremony would not have been an appropriate place for an earnest dialogue on the culture of remembrance, which is why we are trying to find another format with Masha Gessen in which a more substantive discussion can be had.\"\n\nThe awards ceremony, originally scheduled for Friday, has been postponed to Saturday in light of the foundation's departure, but will reportedly still be presented on a smaller scale. According to Gessen, it will also lack many of the trappings usually associated with the award, including a promised lecture at Bremen University.\n\nGessen did not respond to multiple JTA requests for comment, including about the foundation's statement on Friday. They told Middle East Eye in an article published earlier Friday that the New Yorker essay, which quoted Arendt, accorded with Arendt's writing and thought.\n\n\"Hannah Arendt wouldn't have gotten the Hannah Arendt prize if you applied those kinds of criteria to it,\" Gessen said. \"She was very insistent on comparing the Israeli policies and Israeli ideologies to the Nazis. And her project was very much what I'm building on, which is you have to compare in order to identify dangerous similarities.\"\n\nIn an interview prior to the prize controversy, Gessen told the same German paper that Arendt was a major inspiration for them. Gessen was also recently placed on a wanted list in Russia and accused by the Kremlin of spreading false information about the Russian Army, accusations which American journalism institutions have said are meritless.\n\nThe Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York, where Gessen teaches, said in a statement Monday, \"We categorically reject the criminal investigation of Professor Gessen,\" adding that Russia's \"persecution is part of the broader effort to stifle independent journalism.\"\n\nControversy over responses to the Israel-Gaza war has caused turmoil across the world of arts and letters. Last month, a Jewish sponsor pulled out of the National Book Awards after learning that nominees planned to issue a statement criticizing Israel and calling for a ceasefire during the ceremony. The incident followed a controversy at the New York City Jewish cultural center 92NY in which it canceled a planned talk by an author who had signed a letter critical of Israel's actions in Gaza, leading to resignations at the center; a similar sequence of events unfolded at the magazine Artforum.\n\nGessen's Holocaust essay also criticizes Germany's formal policy of considering the BDS movement antisemitic. They report that German officials have frequently gone after intellectuals and activists who invoke the campaign. Gessen also criticizes Israel's own alliances with far-right factions in Germany and Poland and its refusal to overtly align with Ukraine in that country's war against Russia.\n\nAt one point, the essay quotes Arendt's own 1940s-era writings that compared future Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin's political party to the Nazis. Germany's policies combating antisemitism have been criticized by some left-leaning intellectuals for being overly harsh toward critics of Israel.\n\nThe Heinrich Böll Foundation is allied with Germany's Green Party and has offices in Tel Aviv, Ramallah, Washington, D.C., and other locations. On its Israel website, the foundation backs a two-state solution, condemns the Hamas attacks and notes \"the disastrous humanitarian situation in Gaza\" and \"the suffering and pain of the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.\"",

        "body": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations peacekeeping chief says he was very satisfied with the strong support of many countries for its far-flung operations at a recent ministerial meeting, despite \"headwinds and challenges and problems.\"\n\nJean-Pierre Lacroix, the undersecretary-general for peace operations, said in an interview with The Associated Press that the bi-annual ministerial meeting in Ghana' s capital, Accra, earlier this month was attended by nearly 100 countries.\n\nHe said 33 countries made pledges of 117 military and police units for the U.N.'s peacekeeping operations - and 45 countries made over 100 pledges related to training peacekeepers and partnerships.\n\n\"We had really a strong level of support towards peacekeeping, which is great ... and the pledges were very good,\" Lacroix said.\n\nThe number of U.N. peacekeepers and staff has fallen from over 100,000 worldwide to 70,000 as missions have ended, some more successfully than others.\n\nThere are now 12 peacekeeping operations in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East and that number will drop again following demands by the leaders of Mali and Congo for U.N. troops to leave, complaining that the peacekeepers failed in their primary mandate to protect civilians from armed groups.\n\nThere had been concern about continuing support for U.N. peacekeeping with the unprecedented six-month withdrawal of nearly 13,000 peacekeepers from Mali ending this month , and a recent agreement on the phased withdrawal of the more than 14,000-strong force in Congo .\n\nBut Lacroix said there was a strong recommitment to U.N. peacekeeping.\n\nDuring the Accra meeting, he said ministers also discussed U.N. efforts to address other challenges including increasing the number of women peacekeepers, safety and security for troops, misinformation and disinformation affecting peacekeeping operations and discipline, which includes ongoing instances of sexual exploitation and sexual violence by peacekeepers.\n\nParadoxically, he said, U.N. peacekeeping remains one of the most supported U.N. operations, but individually peacekeeping missions face problems because of divisions among the 193 member nations -- especially among the 15 members of the U.N. Security Council who must approve and extend the mandates for peacekeeping missions.\n\nIn the list of pledges, Lacroix said, \"we probably have more than what we need.\"\n\nBut it's just the beginning of a process, he stressed, because the peacekeeping department he heads must now work with countries to turn the pledges into military and police units that can be deployed, and to start training missions.\n\nLooking ahead, Lacroix said member states and host countries have the final say on authorizing new peacekeeping operations and extending existing missions..\n\nIn the vast majority of cases, Lacroix said he believes peacekeeping operations provide \"added value ... even if all peacekeeping operations are facing a much more difficult environment political and security-wise -- all of them, not only in Africa.\"\n\nAs for protecting civilians which the leaders of Mali and Congo strongly criticized, Lacroix said hundreds of thousands of civilians are protected every day by U.N. peacekeepers. And he asked what would happen if peacekeepers were removed from Cyprus or the Golan Heights which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 war -- \"and you could say the same thing about many areas in Africa\" and elsewhere.\n\nUsually, Lacroix said, the U.N. can manage difficulties including a degraded level of security for peacekeeping missions, host governments not fully cooperative, and fake news about peacekeepers.\n\nBut he said missions becomes exceedingly difficult to sustain or even untenable when on top of that you have terrorism as in Mali, which U.N. peacekeepers are not mandated to fight, or regional conflicts like in the Great Lakes region of Africa where its mandate only covered Congo.\n\nAs for the future of peacekeeping, Lacroix said, \"First of all, we're as strong as the unity and commitment of our member states is towards opting for multilateral solutions.\"\n\nIn Mali and Sudan, where peacekeepers were also expelled, he said, \"I think it reflects a world where basically, there is less appetite to sort of go along with the multilateral option.\"\n\nThe ministerial meeting and Lacroix's interview this week (Monday) took place as two major wars raged, in Ukraine following Russia's February 2022 invasion, and in Gaza following Hamas' surprise attacks inside Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nWhen there is a cessation of hostilities in both wars, Lacroix said, under one of many scenarios there may be a need for a third-party observation mission, and he said the U.N. has a good network of people in many countries with those capabilities.",

Security Council who must approve and extend the mandates for peacekeeping missions.\n\nIn the list of pledges, Lacroix said, \"we probably have more than what we need.\"\n\nBut it's just the beginning of a process, he stressed, because the peacekeeping department he heads must now work with countries to turn the pledges into military and police units that can be deployed, and to start training missions.\n\nLooking ahead, Lacroix said member states and host countries have the final say on authorizing new peacekeeping operations and extending existing missions..\n\nIn the vast majority of cases, Lacroix said he believes peacekeeping operations provide \"added value ... even if all peacekeeping operations are facing a much more difficult environment political and security-wise -- all of them, not only in Africa.\"\n\nAs for protecting civilians which the leaders of Mali and Congo strongly criticized, Lacroix said hundreds of thousands of civilians are protected every day by U.N. peacekeepers. And he asked what would happen if peacekeepers were removed from Cyprus or the Golan Heights which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 war -- \"and you could say the same thing about many areas in Africa\" and elsewhere.\n\nUsually, Lacroix said, the U.N. can manage difficulties including a degraded level of security for peacekeeping missions, host governments not fully cooperative, and fake news about peacekeepers.\n\nBut he said missions becomes exceedingly difficult to sustain or even untenable when on top of that you have terrorism as in Mali, which U.N. peacekeepers are not mandated to fight, or regional conflicts like in the Great Lakes region of Africa where its mandate only covered Congo.\n\nAs for the future of peacekeeping, Lacroix said, \"First of all, we're as strong as the unity and commitment of our member states is towards opting for multilateral solutions.\"\n\nIn Mali and Sudan, where peacekeepers were also expelled, he said, \"I think it reflects a world where basically, there is less appetite to sort of go along with the multilateral option.\"\n\nThe ministerial meeting and Lacroix's interview this week (Monday) took place as two major wars raged, in Ukraine following Russia's February 2022 invasion, and in Gaza following Hamas' surprise attacks inside Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nWhen there is a cessation of hostilities in both wars, Lacroix said, under one of many scenarios there may be a need for a third-party observation mission, and he said the U.N. has a good network of people in many countries with those capabilities.",

And he asked what would happen if peacekeepers were removed from Cyprus or the Golan Heights which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 war -- \"and you could say the same thing about many areas in Africa\" and elsewhere.\n\nUsually, Lacroix said, the U.N. can manage difficulties including a degraded level of security for peacekeeping missions, host governments not fully cooperative, and fake news about peacekeepers.\n\nBut he said missions becomes exceedingly difficult to sustain or even untenable when on top of that you have terrorism as in Mali, which U.N. peacekeepers are not mandated to fight, or regional conflicts like in the Great Lakes region of Africa where its mandate only covered Congo.\n\nAs for the future of peacekeeping, Lacroix said, \"First of all, we're as strong as the unity and commitment of our member states is towards opting for multilateral solutions.\"\n\nIn Mali and Sudan, where peacekeepers were also expelled, he said, \"I think it reflects a world where basically, there is less appetite to sort of go along with the multilateral option.\"\n\nThe ministerial meeting and Lacroix's interview this week (Monday) took place as two major wars raged, in Ukraine following Russia's February 2022 invasion, and in Gaza following Hamas' surprise attacks inside Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nWhen there is a cessation of hostilities in both wars, Lacroix said, under one of many scenarios there may be a need for a third-party observation mission, and he said the U.N. has a good network of people in many countries with those capabilities.",

Security Council who must approve and extend the mandates for peacekeeping missions.\n\nIn the list of pledges, Lacroix said, \"we probably have more than what we need.\"\n\nBut it's just the beginning of a process, he stressed, because the peacekeeping department he heads must now work with countries to turn the pledges into military and police units that can be deployed, and to start training missions.\n\nLooking ahead, Lacroix said member states and host countries have the final say on authorizing new peacekeeping operations and extending existing missions..\n\nIn the vast majority of cases, Lacroix said he believes peacekeeping operations provide \"added value ... even if all peacekeeping operations are facing a much more difficult environment political and security-wise -- all of them, not only in Africa.\"\n\nAs for protecting civilians which the leaders of Mali and Congo strongly criticized, Lacroix said hundreds of thousands of civilians are protected every day by U.N. peacekeepers. And he asked what would happen if peacekeepers were removed from Cyprus or the Golan Heights which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 war -- \"and you could say the same thing about many areas in Africa\" and elsewhere.\n\nUsually, Lacroix said, the U.N. can manage difficulties including a degraded level of security for peacekeeping missions, host governments not fully cooperative, and fake news about peacekeepers.\n\nBut he said missions becomes exceedingly difficult to sustain or even untenable when on top of that you have terrorism as in Mali, which U.N. peacekeepers are not mandated to fight, or regional conflicts like in the Great Lakes region of Africa where its mandate only covered Congo.\n\nAs for the future of peacekeeping, Lacroix said, \"First of all, we're as strong as the unity and commitment of our member states is towards opting for multilateral solutions.\"\n\nIn Mali and Sudan, where peacekeepers were also expelled, he said, \"I think it reflects a world where basically, there is less appetite to sort of go along with the multilateral option.\"\n\nThe ministerial meeting and Lacroix's interview this week (Monday) took place as two major wars raged, in Ukraine following Russia's February 2022 invasion, and in Gaza following Hamas' surprise attacks inside Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nWhen there is a cessation of hostilities in both wars, Lacroix said, under one of many scenarios there may be a need for a third-party observation mission, and he said the U.N. has a good network of people in many countries with those capabilities.",

        "body": "UNITED NATIONS (AP) -- The United Nations peacekeeping chief says he was very satisfied with the strong support of many countries for its far-flung operations at a recent ministerial meeting, despite \"headwinds and challenges and problems.\"\n\nJean-Pierre Lacroix, the undersecretary-general for peace operations, said in an interview with The Associated Press that the bi-annual ministerial meeting in Ghana' s capital, Accra, earlier this month was attended by nearly 100 countries.\n\nHe said 33 countries made pledges of 117 military and police units for the U.N.'s peacekeeping operations - and 45 countries made over 100 pledges related to training peacekeepers and partnerships.\n\n\"We had really a strong level of support towards peacekeeping, which is great ... and the pledges were very good,\" Lacroix said.\n\nThe number of U.N. peacekeepers and staff has fallen from over 100,000 worldwide to 70,000 as missions have ended, some more successfully than others.\n\nThere are now 12 peacekeeping operations in Africa, Asia, Europe and the Middle East and that number will drop again following demands by the leaders of Mali and Congo for U.N. troops to leave, complaining that the peacekeepers failed in their primary mandate to protect civilians from armed groups.\n\nThere had been concern about continuing support for U.N. peacekeeping with the unprecedented six-month withdrawal of nearly 13,000 peacekeepers from Mali ending this month, and a recent agreement on the phased withdrawal of the more than 14,000-strong force in Congo.\n\nBut Lacroix said there was a strong recommitment to U.N. peacekeeping.\n\nDuring the Accra meeting, he said ministers also discussed U.N. efforts to address other challenges including increasing the number of women peacekeepers, safety and security for troops, misinformation and disinformation affecting peacekeeping operations and discipline, which includes ongoing instances of sexual exploitation and sexual violence by peacekeepers.\n\nParadoxically, he said, U.N. peacekeeping remains one of the most supported U.N. operations, but individually peacekeeping missions face problems because of divisions among the 193 member nations -- especially among the 15 members of the U.N. Security Council who must approve and extend the mandates for peacekeeping missions.\n\nIn the list of pledges, Lacroix said, \"we probably have more than what we need.\"\n\nBut it's just the beginning of a process, he stressed, because the peacekeeping department he heads must now work with countries to turn the pledges into military and police units that can be deployed, and to start training missions.\n\nLooking ahead, Lacroix said member states and host countries have the final say on authorizing new peacekeeping operations and extending existing missions..\n\nIn the vast majority of cases, Lacroix said he believes peacekeeping operations provide \"added value ... even if all peacekeeping operations are facing a much more difficult environment political and security-wise -- all of them, not only in Africa.\"\n\nAs for protecting civilians which the leaders of Mali and Congo strongly criticized, Lacroix said hundreds of thousands of civilians are protected every day by U.N. peacekeepers. And he asked what would happen if peacekeepers were removed from Cyprus or the Golan Heights which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 war -- \"and you could say the same thing about many areas in Africa\" and elsewhere.\n\nUsually, Lacroix said, the U.N. can manage difficulties including a degraded level of security for peacekeeping missions, host governments not fully cooperative, and fake news about peacekeepers.\n\nBut he said missions becomes exceedingly difficult to sustain or even untenable when on top of that you have terrorism as in Mali, which U.N. peacekeepers are not mandated to fight, or regional conflicts like in the Great Lakes region of Africa where its mandate only covered Congo.\n\nAs for the future of peacekeeping, Lacroix said, \"First of all, we're as strong as the unity and commitment of our member states is towards opting for multilateral solutions.\"\n\nIn Mali and Sudan, where peacekeepers were also expelled, he said, \"I think it reflects a world where basically, there is less appetite to sort of go along with the multilateral option.\"\n\nThe ministerial meeting and Lacroix's interview this week (Monday) took place as two major wars raged, in Ukraine following Russia's February 2022 invasion, and in Gaza following Hamas' surprise attacks inside Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nWhen there is a cessation of hostilities in both wars, Lacroix said, under one of many scenarios there may be a need for a third-party observation mission, and he said the U.N. has a good network of people in many countries with those capabilities.",

And he asked what would happen if peacekeepers were removed from Cyprus or the Golan Heights which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 war -- \"and you could say the same thing about many areas in Africa\" and elsewhere.\n\nUsually, Lacroix said, the U.N. can manage difficulties including a degraded level of security for peacekeeping missions, host governments not fully cooperative, and fake news about peacekeepers.\n\nBut he said missions becomes exceedingly difficult to sustain or even untenable when on top of that you have terrorism as in Mali, which U.N. peacekeepers are not mandated to fight, or regional conflicts like in the Great Lakes region of Africa where its mandate only covered Congo.\n\nAs for the future of peacekeeping, Lacroix said, \"First of all, we're as strong as the unity and commitment of our member states is towards opting for multilateral solutions.\"\n\nIn Mali and Sudan, where peacekeepers were also expelled, he said, \"I think it reflects a world where basically, there is less appetite to sort of go along with the multilateral option.\"\n\nThe ministerial meeting and Lacroix's interview this week (Monday) took place as two major wars raged, in Ukraine following Russia's February 2022 invasion, and in Gaza following Hamas' surprise attacks inside Israel on Oct. 7.\n\nWhen there is a cessation of hostilities in both wars, Lacroix said, under one of many scenarios there may be a need for a third-party observation mission, and he said the U.N. has a good network of people in many countries with those capabilities.\n\nCopyright 2023 The Associated Press.

        "body": "The Yellowstone Rim Runners thank all of the good people who came out Thanksgiving morning to participate in the 13th annual Run! Turkey Run! It was a brisk 25 degrees that day, but we were warmed by your generosity and good will. It was a pleasure to see all you happy people enjoying the event. We also owe many, many thanks to the more than 50 hardy volunteers who helped with packet pickup, food, beer garden, setup, cleanup, and course guarding; you made it happen!\n\nWe are indebted to many terrific sponsors who support the event with contributions of time, labor and materials, as well as funding. We especially want to recognize Wise Wonders Science and Discovery Museum and the Billings Association of Realtors who allow us to use their facilities, and Billings Clinic -- our major sponsor.\n\nThe contributions made by participants, volunteers and sponsors will allow us to donate a total of $40,000 to five wonderful organizations that work to alleviate hunger in our community: the Adult Resource Alliance (Meals on Wheels), Family Service, Inc., the BackPack Meals Program of the Education Foundation for Billings Public Schools, the MSUB Yellowjacket Emergency Pantry, and the Rocky Mountain College Bear Cupboard.\n\nThanks again to all who helped make the Run! Turkey Run! a great event!\n\nThe Yellowstone Rim Runners Board of Directors\n\nSen. Jon Tester should've done stand-up comedy. Really hilarious. Not quite. His current ads have him saying he doesn't look like a typical senator. Well, Jon, those knowing your record know you are a typical politician. In Washington you follow the party line. But, you don't represent Montana. You talk nice when in Montana, and then do the opposite in Washington. Then, your ad has you saying China is the most dangerous adversary the U.S. has. True, Jon. WHY, then, didn't you do anything about the Chinese spy balloon passing over Montana?\n\nThen, one of your ads has a couple praising you for something you did for them. Anyone could have done what they say you did, Jon. The comedy? Your ad has you driving an old pickup, and you getting folksy about defending the Montana way of life. What a joke, Jon. I have a rusted 1978 Ford, and own some farmland. But, I'm not a farmer, and, what I see of you, doesn't lead me to see you as a real farmer. But it sels well.\n\nFellow Montanans, understand what Jon Tester is, and what he isn't. He is no good for Montana, and doesn't really represent you. Don't let his ads fool you. Montanans. In a year, vote against Jon Tester.\n\nOur downtown Billings has gotten progressively worse over the years. Rapidly decaying and not at all enticing to visitors. What comes to my mind is, it looks like a war zone. Which isn't to far off the mark, in that crime and homelessness have increased exponentially.\n\nThe situation has been compounded by the shambles in our urban sprawl. The powers that be can put out all the stops to eradicate the issues we have but unfortunately will only make a dent unless our politicians rally around with law enforcement to do something pro-active.\n\nI speak on past experience. I did not leave Georgia unscathed. I too got caught up in the web of drugs and addiction. I was incarcerated, stripped of my dignity and essentially lost everything. With that tiny mustard seed 20 years ago I embarked on a life-changing journey to keep a promise to my son.\n\nSo I stepped out on faith with two suitcases and a duffel bag to come up here and start over. These drug cartels have their under-kings to do there dirty work which infiltrates our community. Take one out, there's another in the wings. I worked with the North Georgia Task Force to clear my name. I have worked hard to regain all that I lost. Billings is declining not thriving. Let's return our city to its former glory and beautify it.\n\nPlease consider making a donation to Billings Public Schools through the Innovative Educational Tax Credit -- HB 408. The tax credit was passed by the Montana Legislature in 2023 to allow individuals and corporations to make donations to Montana public school districts to support Innovative Educational Programs. Montana taxpayers may donate any amount up to $200,000 in a dollar-for-dollar tax credit toward their income tax bills. In 2024, the amount set aside in Montana for the Innovative Educational Tax Credit statewide is $5 million for public schools.\n\nBeginning in January 2024, school districts can begin accepting gifts from individuals or businesses for the dollar-for-dollar tax credit for the 2024 year. Beginning on Jan. 17, 2024, school districts will begin entering gifts into the Department of Revenue Education Donations Portal until the $5 million statewide cap is reached. In 2023, the $2 million cap was reached in 48 hours.\n\nYour gift will provide direct support to Billings Public Schools to provide innovative educational programs to students. A specific focus in 2024 is dual credit tuition and other expenses students may incur in their pursuit of earning college and high school credits at the same time. This dollar-for-dollar tax credit supports our local public schools and students while providing taxpayers with a dollar for dollar reduction on their state taxes.\n\nI am a 38-year veteran of inner-city law enforcement. The alarming rate of gang violence in Billings is sending a signal and someone needs to see it. The city administrator saying the problem is being addressed by \"a two-person, kinda gang unit, so it's not taking resources from our street crimes unit\" is just unbelievable.\n\nHow many gang arrests does the BPD Street Crimes Unit make? Are there more \"street crimes\" than gang crimes in Billings? In the major city I worked in, early on city leaders said the violence was caused by \"local groups\" and denied any existence of actual gang presence. This until a 7-year-old girl was killed. Then the city fathers finally listened to its police department and a full court press was initiated. Bloods, Crips, Latin Kings, Jamaicans and others had flourished.\n\nI say this because gangs, both Black and Hispanic, as well as fully organized nationally recognized gangs, are already imbedded and operating here in Billings. Thirty-nine shootings with nine homicides so far this year is clear evidence that gang violence is far ahead of any proactive law enforcement and way more than a \"two-person\" gang unit is needed.\n\nAnyone with experience like mine can drive throughout Billings and see the effects of gang influence with openly visible drug sales and some \"colors\" being displayed by gang members. The \"West Coast\" gangs as well as cartels are already here folks. Please listen Billings fathers.\n\nI am writing to call attention to the fact that both Sen. Daines and Sen. Tester voted this week for continuing war in the Middle East by voting against Sen. Rand Paul's S.J. Res. 51.\n\nThis was a war powers resolution directing the President to remove U.S. troops from harm's way in Syria where they have been repeatedly targeted. We deserve an explanation for why we are fighting in Syria and why our Senators voted against removing our troops.\n\nDo we know why we are involved in ancient conflicts?\n\nHas our presence made the world a safer place?\n\nWhat has thousands of American deaths, thousands more shattered bodies and minds and trillions in debt done to improve our country and our security or anyone else's country? Do we really believe that our state department, intelligence agencies and four administrations have done a great job since 9/11?\n\nMaybe we need to hold our leaders and ourselves to a little higher standard.\n\nLike many others, I'm watching in horror as, after a brief cease-fire, violence returns unabated in Israel-Gaza. So now the lives of millions of civilians and the remaining hostages who have not been released are again under threat.\n\nSurely it's clear that more war is not the answer, and a military solution to this crisis is not a possibility. Yet the conflict continues. The Israeli war machine, with active support from the U.S., has already killed an astounding 18,000 or more people, including countless innocent women and children. According to the WHO, a child is killed every 10 minutes in Gaza.\n\nThe word I don't want to hear keeps emerging: isn't this genocide?\n\nOur representatives in Congress need to hear from us, loud and clear, the call for a ceasefire in Israel/Palestine. Don't we owe at least that much to the Palestinian children still alive?\n\nI am pleased an overwhelming majority of voters rejected the Parks Bond levy. In my opinion those promoting this extra tax showed a lack of empathy, concern and sensitivity for those living on limited incomes. This proposed tax increase came during a time when we are all trying to endure high inflation and a massive property tax increase. The one project we should take on now is the South Park improvements. This often-overlooked section of our city deserves attention now, and completion of this project would benefit all South Side residents.\n\nSome years ago I was involved in the Gateway Park project located at the intersection of Rimrock Road and 27th Street. The state, city and MSUB all lacked funds for this needed visual enhancement at our city's Gateway. A committee formed by the MSU-B Alumni Association took on this worthwhile project. They accepted responsibility for planning, and coordination. This successful effort was accomplished without taxpayer dollars.\n\nI suspect a citizens' group could accomplish something similar for South Park. Possibly the private offers made to donate funds for the failed levy projects could be re-directed to South Park?\n\nI suspect a concerned citizens' group could take on this endeavor as did the group that accomplished the Gateway Park project. I know I would gladly donate to the cause, and I suspect many others would also. We could accomplish this together without any increase in taxes.\n\nIt continues to be distressing to me that Sen. Steve Daines seems dedicated to removing the designations of Wilderness Study Area and the attending protections they are each afforded. These lands are greatly valued and treasures of the State of Montana. This is the third attempt by Sen. Daines to remove protection for these lands, which constitute over 100,000 acres. He wants to get rid of what makes Montana so unique.\n\nHe hasn't figured out, first, that a majority of Montanans oppose this action and, secondly, that if anyone is going to call for a change in management, it would be the people of the areas in which The Middle Fork Judith in the Little Belt Mountains south of Great Falls and Hoodoo Mountain, the Wales Creek in the Garnet Range outside of Ovando, and finally Helmville. These lands serve as prime wildlife habitat and great outdoor recreation opportunities for locals and us all.\n\nDaines has not included Montanans in these plans. Removing protections from wilderness study areas will degrade the ecological balance necessary for wildlife to thrive and Montanans to enjoy what makes our state unique. Don't hesitate to let him know what you think.\n\nHate crimes/vandalism in Billings inspired a worldwide response in 1993 with \"Not in Our Town\" (NIOT). Recent Gazette stories by Jake Iverson and Phil Drake remind those that don't know, or have forgotten. Sadly anti-Semitism continues worse than ever.\n\nFor a poignant historic experience, visit the Yellowstone Art Museum (now free admission) and see (in the back hall) a large photo by Frederic Brenner, international French photographer of the Jewish diaspora. He was inspired by our town's NIOT backbone, and came to take this picture which has been published all over the world. Our fellow citizens hold Menorahs on the 27th Street RR crossing. You will recognize many faces.\n\nI used to work at the Billings Food Bank and witnessed the problems that our community has spoke out about for the last 25+ years. It is such a shame that the people who can make change have failed this community and allow this to continue.\n\nThe current CEO will have to answer to a power much greater than any of us and if the legacy she chooses to leave is that of a mean, nasty, rude, selfish , woman then it is her choice. We reap what we sow and you Sheryle Shandy will have to answer to God.\n\nIt doesn't matter what socioeconomic status you are from, everyone deserves to be treated with kindness and humanity. Is it because it doesn't affect you? This question goes to our leaders in Billings and Montana that have chosen to turn a blind eye? The three remaining board members should be ashamed of themselves to allow this to continue.\n\nIf any of these board members have an ounce of decency, they will do the right thing and vote this CEO out and allow the organization to serve the public the way it was intended. Billings can be better but as a community we must choose to take a stand and do what's right even if means it's not popular. To the CEO of the Food Bank: I'm sure you don't own a lot of mirrors considering how difficult it would be to look at yourself in one.\n\nSen. Jon Tester wrote and/or sponsored into law over three dozen bills supporting veterans. Donald Trump signed 11 of these, in addition to 19 other bills Tester co-authored or co-sponsored.\n\nMontana has nearly 100,000 veterans, one of the highest percentages per capita in our country. My father was a proud veteran, and benefitted greatly from Senator Tester's hard work, in particular from the Vet's Cost of Living Adjustment, Choice & Accountability and Health Care and Benefits Improvement Acts. Because of these, my father had both quality care and a dignified death in VA facilities.\n\nJon Tester has served on the Senate Veterans' Affairs Committee since 2007, and as Committee Chair since 2021. He has authored nearly 150 veteran-focused bills into the complex process of becoming law. He fought tirelessly for the bipartisan PACT Act with benefits and care for toxic-exposed veterans and their families, including for Vietnam-era veterans exposed to Agent Orange. Tester also facilitated passage of laws for mental health care and expanded services for female and Native American vets. The senator was the driver for the VA health care facility in Hamilton. Tester works hard for Montanans and all U.S. citizens. He supports our first responders -- law enforcement, firefighters and border patrol agents -- and successfully fought for fair and improved pay for Border Patrol Agents and Wildland Firefighters.\n\nTester is currently working to protect Second Amendment rights, stopping foreclosures for veterans, and scamming of our veterans. My deepest thanks to all who serve, and to Senator Tester for his support.",

However, even in the middle of turbulence God's faithfulness is still true and can be trusted.\n\nWhat was so meaningful about the first Christmas was the fact that God had finally fulfilled His promise, even if in the strangest way possible by bringing a baby into the world to a teen girl in a manger. And today, what makes Christmas even more special is that as we see the signs of the end times creeping upon us, it is a reminder that God will be good and faithful to once again do as He said and return to His people.\n\nGet your FREE CHARISMA NEWSLETTERS today! Stay up to date with current issues, Holy Spirit news, Christian teachings, Charisma videos & more!\n\nRevelation 22:6 is a powerful verse of Scripture as it says: \"The angel said to me, 'These words are faithful and true. The Lord God of the holy prophets sent His angel to show to His servants the things which must soon take place.'\"\n\nThere are things that must happen. The wars and rumors of wars, the birth pangs, the coming of the Antichrist -- everything must happen that was foretold. However, not only must they happen, but they will happen because God's Word is faithful and true, and it never returns void. And while many of the things to come are painful and pressuring, it means we are getting closer to uniting with the One we love: Jesus.\n\nRevelation 22:17 says, \"The Spirit and the bride say, 'Come.' Let him who hears say, 'Come.' Let him who is thirsty come. Let him who desires take the water of life freely.\"\n\nWhile we are living in a time where we see Israel under attack, the indoctrination of children growing more rampant and political divides continue to grow, we are also experiencing revivals, seeing people delivered from the demonic oppression and the gospel is reaching to the very ends of the earth. All of these events collectively point to the buildup for the greatest event still to come, and that's the return of Christ for His bride, where we will forever experience the wonder of His presence and what it means to be filled with His living water.\n\nSo, even though it could be easy to reminisce about past Christmases and longing for what already has been, where we are headed, while difficult for a time, will bring about the deepest and most joyful day still to come. As we approach Christmas and remember the birth of the Savior, we can also, with great expectation and assurance, look to His return and an eternity with Him that will be more than anything we ever could have hoped for or imagined.\n\nJoin Charisma Magazine Online to follow everything the Holy Spirit is doing around the world!\n\nAbby Trivett is a marketing copywriter and coordinator for Charisma Media.\n\nTo contact us or to submit an article, click here.\n\nGet Charisma's best content delivered right to your inbox!

        "title": "Obituary - Mary Wyatt Lloyd - The Henrico Citizen",
        "body": "Mary Wyatt Lloyd, 96, passed away on December 6, 2023. Daughter of the late Rosser Samuel Wyatt and Annie Laurie Kandle Wyatt, she was born \"down the country\" in Middlesex County, Virginia, in 1927, graduating from Saluda High School in 1946. In addition to her parents, she was preceded in death by her son, John Carter Lloyd; her daughter, Rebecca Wyatt Lloyd; her beloved brothers and sisters, Clifton Wyatt, Gladys Wyatt LeCompte, Addie Wyatt Simmons, Theadis Wyatt Tinsley, Margarette Wyatt Howell, Robert Henry Wyatt, John Wyatt, Wilbur \"Teenie\" Wyatt and Walter Wyatt; as well as a number of her nieces and nephews, including recently Barbara LeCompte Nelson. She is survived by her daughter, Susan Lloyd Caddell (Bobby), of Durham, N.C.; and her daughter-in-law, Barbara Trevvett Lloyd, of Glen Allen, Va. \"Aunt Mary\" leaves behind nieces and nephews and great nieces and nephews who meant so much to her; long-time neighbors in Glen Allen, where she lived for nearly six decades; life-long friends and classmates; and new friends, associates, and caregivers at Vitality Living West End Richmond, where she lived for nine years. Mary traveled to many U.S. states, and to Argentina, China, Russia, Israel, Egypt, South Africa, England, France, and Germany, among others, but was always happy to come home to see \"Old Glory\" flying, considering the U.S. the \"most beautiful country in the world\" and Virginia the \"most beautiful state in our country.\" Following memberships at Greenwood United Methodist Church and Staples Mill Road Baptist Church, Mary was an early member of Faith Landmark Ministries. Most important to her, she used her time and talents to serve her Lord and Savior Jesus Christ.\n\nHer family will receive friends at 11 a.m. on Friday, December 15, at the Central Chapel of Bennett Funeral Home, 3215 Cutshaw Avenue, Richmond, with a service afterward in Bennett's Chapel at 12 p.m. Interment will follow in Forest Lawn Cemetery, 4000 Pilots Lane, Richmond. To honor and remember Mary, consider brightening someone's day by sending flowers to them, or by donating to Guiding Eyes for the Blind.",

Avoid sites that inflate views using bots or fakes. Real views from real users won't risk penalties.\n\nIf you want to buy YouTube views, there are many ways you can pay for this service.\n\nDepending on the provider you use, these may vary, but some of the most common payment methods are credit card, Google Pay, PayPal, Apple Pay, and cryptocurrencies.\n\nDelivery speeds vary between sites, but most send views gradually over days or weeks. Instant blast views seem fake. Organic pacing like 50-100 daily views is ideal. Orders typically start in 1-2 days.\n\nBased on my research, the best sites to buy real and active YouTube views are:\n\nBulkoid.com;\n\nFastPromo.net;\n\nViralHQ.net\n\n5. Where do the views come from?\n\nReliable sites source views from worldwide locations and accounts. Geographic targeting options may be available. Views are high-quality when coming from real humans interested in your content.\n\nSome providers allow buyers to target views by age, gender, interests, languages, countries, and more. Targeting helps viewers engage better with relevant content.\n\nCost depends on factors like total views ordered, delivery speed, and audience targeting. 1,000 views may cost $10-$30 from top sites. Deals are available for larger bulk orders, e.g. 100,000 views for $800.\n\nYes, quality real views signal to YouTube's algorithm that a video resonates. This can boost impressions, suggested videos placement, and search rankings for more organic views.\n\nBuying real YouTube views fully complies with YouTube's terms of service. As long as views come from genuine accounts watching content they enjoy, it is legal and encouraged.\n\nAfter researching the top companies selling YouTube views, Bulkoid stands out as the clear #1 choice. They focus on view quality rather than quantity - each view comes from a real person interested in your niche, not inflated by fake bot accounts. Bulkoid views are the most likely to convert to active, engaged subscribers.\n\nI recommend Bulkoid because their views blend seamlessly into a video's existing traction. Views are delivered gradually, averaging 50-150 per day from worldwide locations.\n\nThis organic pacing avoids alerting YouTube's fraud detection while signaling a video's rising popularity. Bulkoid also offers excellent targeting, allowing buyers to select viewer demographics and interests tailored to each video.\n\nFor the best YouTube partner that delivers maximum impressions, suggested video placements, and search rankings boosts from real views, Bulkoid cannot be beaten.\n\nTheir 5-star reputation for reliable delivery of genuine, organic views makes them my top choice. For any YouTuber serious about profiting from their platform, investing in Bulkoid's services is the smartest decision.\n\nThe news and editorial staff of the Times Herald Online had no role in this post's preparation.

        "title": "Great Barrington Police Department investigates middle school over 'Gender Queer: A Memoir'",
        "body": "District Attorney Timothy Shugrue: \"The complaint that was filed did not involve criminal activity, therefore, the Great Barrington Police Department and our office have closed the matter and referred any further action back to the Berkshire Hills Regional School District.\"\n\nGreat Barrington -- The town's Police Department conducted an investigation at W.E.B. Du Bois Regional Middle School over a book. Both Berkshire Hills Regional School District Superintendent Peter Dillon and Police Chief Paul Storti confirmed the investigation to The Berkshire Edge.\n\nAccording to Dillon, the book in question is \"Gender Queer,\" a 2019 graphic novel by Maia Kobabe. The book won an Alex Award from the American Library Association (ALA) in 2020. According to the ALA's website, the Alex Award is given to a book \"that has special appeal to young adults, ages 12 through 18.\" The book also won a Stonewall Book Awards Israel Fishman Non-Fiction Award from the ALA in 2020. The award is \"presented to English language books that have exceptional merit relating to the LGBTQIA+ experience.\"\n\nAccording to book publisher Simon & Schuster's website, the autobiographical graphic novel was written \"as a way to explain to their family what it means to be nonbinary and asexual.\" Simon & Schuster explains, \"'Gender Queer' is more than a personal story: it is a useful and touching guide on gender identity -- what it means and how to think about it -- for advocates, friends, and humans everywhere.\"\n\nIn an email to members of the school district on Thursday, December 14, Dillon shared details of the police investigation over \"Gender Queer.\" \"On Friday, [December 8], Chief [Storti] reached out to me to share that they were conducting an investigation related to a complaint about a book at the middle school,\" Dillon wrote in his email. \"At the end of the school day, an officer in plain clothes tried to locate that book. Principal [Miles] Wheat spoke with the officer and with the teacher and they looked for the book, but did not find it.\" Dillon wrote that the anonymous complaint was referred to the Berkshire County District Attorney's office by the Police Department.\n\n\"Gender Queer\" is \"not a class text but a supplemental material that students can request to sign out,\" according to Dillon. \"The book is a graphic novel and a memoir of a nonbinary person,\" Dillon wrote. \"It has won several awards and is the topic of some controversy. It depicts some images that some find offensive. At the same time, many see it as an important story helping build empathy and support for a marginalized group and helping trans or queer students make meaning.\"\n\nDillon wrote that, while the school district has policies in place if a parent has concerns about a book, \"our policies did not anticipate this situation.\" Dillon explained: \"In the former case, a form is completed and a reconsideration process can take place. In these types of situations, many other districts form a review committee either of the school, district, and families or of the school committee, to read and rate the book. Other districts have done so with this book and choices have been to keep it, limit it to some by age or a warning label, or to exclude it. Most in the Northeast have kept it.\"\n\nIn an interview with The Berkshire Edge, Dillon said that the Police Department does not have any right to ban books used in the school district. \"Book [usage] is the decision of the school committee, and the school committee often delegates [the decision] to teachers and principals,\" Dillon said. \"What I hope will happen is that this comes back to being a school decision, which it should be. Then we'll go through a process to decide if it's appropriate or not [for the school district], and at what grade level. There are a lot of conversations about whether this book should be banned. But that's not a conversation that I am leading.\"\n\nDillon said that the copy of \"Gender Queer\" in question was in a teacher's classroom, but he did not name the teacher who had the copy of the book. \"For the moment, we are unable to locate [the copy],\" Dillon said. \"I've been trying to support the teachers [in the school district]. The only thing the teacher [with the book] might have done better, just like we would in a health class for example, we give parents a heads up that we're going to be talking about contraception. If somebody's religious or philosophical views are such that they don't want their child to hear about that, then they can reach out to us and have their child opt out of the class. This book wasn't taught in the class but was a supplemental resource. If somebody wanted to use it, they could. But we didn't allow parents to say that they didn't want their child to use it. That's the only change I'd make going forward.\"\n\nWhen asked if the Great Barrington Police Department has a right to go into the school buildings in the district to seek out a book, Dillon gave a multifaceted answer. \"It's in our interest to work with [the department] because we don't just need them when things are good, we need them when things are bad,\" Dillon said. \"We meet with them a lot, and we have a good working relationship. However, I think [the department] overreached on this one [case]. If [the department] believed that the book was obscene or pornographic, then they are investigating a potential crime. So they definitely would have a right [to investigate]. But if you believe that the book is just honest, then they don't have a right.\"\n\nIn an email to The Berkshire Edge, Police Chief Storti referred to The Berkshire County District Attorney's Office for comment. In a statement from the District Attorney's Office, District Attorney Timothy Shugrue said, \"The complaint that was filed did not involve criminal activity, therefore, the Great Barrington Police Department and our office have closed the matter and referred any further action back to the Berkshire Hills Regional School District.\" According to the statement Dillon superintend assured the District Attorney's Office that the issue will be reviewed according to the Berkshire Hills Regional School District's policies and will remain as a school department matter.\n\nWhile the Berkshire Hills Regional School District Committee met on December 14, they did not address the situation. However, during the public comments portion at the end of the meeting, parent Erica Mielke expressed her concerns to the committee. \"I was happy to see Peter's letter, and I think it raises a lot of important community issues around how the Police Department is making decisions, especially when they are calling on police to interfere with something that should be a school issue,\" Mielke said. \"How we all talk about issues around banning books and responding with knee-jerk reactions to things seems to be coming from a place of fear. I think there's a really big discussion to be had here. I'm in communication with a lot of other parents that are extremely concerned.\"\n\nIn response, Committee Chairman Stephen Bannon told Mielke that the issues surrounding the book were not discussed at the meeting because it was not on the meeting's agenda. However, Bannon said that the issues would likely be discussed at the committee's next meeting in January.",

Vernon High School and Cameron Mann of New Palestine High School were this year's recipients of the coveted award, which covers full tuition for two carefully selected Hancock County seniors each year.\n\nThe scholarship program is carried out locally by the Community Foundation of Hancock County, which honored this year's recipients Dec. 14 with a reception at the foundation's Thrive Center in Greenfield.\n\nBoth of the scholars' principals shared a bit about each student's character and accomplishments at the reception.\n\n\"Mya is an outstanding student and an all-around great person,\" said Brooke Tharp, principal at Mt. Vernon High School, who then shared Mya's long list of volunteer-based activities.\n\nJames Voelz, Principal at New Palestine High School, did the same for Cameron.\n\n\"I've known Cameron since he was about six years old,\" said Voelz. \"He has an incredibly special family who did a great job of raising him. He is such a positive light in our school and everywhere he goes.\"\n\nBoth Mya and Cameron said they were overwhelmed to be selected among a field of 60 highly accomplished candidates throughout the county, including two finalists from each of the county's four high schools.\n\n\"It's truly been a life changing experience. I'll definitely carry it with me for the rest of my life, and I hope to be able to pay it forward in the future,\" said Mya, the daughter of David and Mary Adams of Fortville.\n\nMya plans to attend the University of Notre Dame or Butler University in the fall, where she hopes to major in political science, psychology and history. Her goal is to pursue a career in public law.\n\nCameron, the son of Jeff and Janet Mann of New Palestine, plans to attend Purdue University and major in pre-med, engineering or computer science. His goal is to become a cardiologist.\n\nLast year, Cameron was diagnosed with cardiomyopathy, a hereditary disease which makes it hard for the heart to deliver blood to the body, which can lead to heart failure. His hope is to become a heart doctor to help kids who face the same challenges he has over the past year.\n\nWhile they both have lofty goals to one day serve others professionally, Cameron and Mya have already devoted a good portion of their young lives to giving back to others, which is among the highest held factors in the Lilly Scholarship selection process.\n\nBefore his own cardiomyopathy diagnosis, Cameron's sister collapsed at school in 2021 from the same disease, prompting him to want to do something to support her and other students who may face the same type of crisis.\n\nHe has since been working toward getting New Palestine High School certified through Project Adam, a nonprofit which seeks to equip schools with Automated External Defibrillators -- portable electronic devices which can provide life-saving emergency treatment.\n\n\"While there are many steps to completion, I would like to eventually certify all schools in the county,\" Cameron said.\n\nHe also created a radio station called Chemo Radio, the world's first online radio station created to provide comfort to those undergoing chemotherapy.\n\n\"I hope the station gives them some cheer and provides a smile during difficult times,\" said the teen, adding that at last count the station was listened to in 11 different countries.\n\nCameron also enjoys making a difference close to home. He's been a Fresh Start leader, mentoring incoming freshmen at New Palestine High School.\n\nEach year since the seventh grade, he's helped his former middle school running coach lead a group of elementary school runners in a weekly program.\n\nThe high school senior co-created an organization that creates STEM lessons for elementary-age kids and designed a math workbook called Fridays With, which helps elementary and middle school students practice problem-solving skills without using the internet.\n\nHe's also created Super Pawn Chess, a game variant he hopes can be played by dementia patients like his grandfather.\n\nWhen his heart condition forced him to quit the varsity track team, he became a peer buddy on his school's Unified Track Team instead, supporting student athletes with special needs.\n\nMya has also racked up a long list of accomplishments throughout her high school career.\n\nAs a junior, she attended a leadership program in which students were encouraged to identify and address issues within their school corporation. To help students struggling with bullying, substance abuse and mental health, Mya created a website called Outreach Tree to provide resources that can help. Working in collaboration with the school's guidance department, she affixed QR codes in the bathroom stalls throughout her high school which students can scan to access the site.\n\nThe teen also helps serve younger students in a variety of programs, like helping with the parent-led group at Fortville Elementary which oversees school activities like festivals, trunk or treats, dances and babysitting for PTO meetings.\n\nMay also prepares weekly crafts at the Vernon Township Public Library, has served as a Camp Invention counselor and has participated in the Best Buddies tutoring program at her high school. She's also helped Fortville Elementary teachers prepare their classrooms for the new school year over summer break.\n\nShe said the organization she's loved serving the most is Ballerina's Academy of Dance, a small locally-owned dance studio where the staff teaches dance classes and life lessons to students from preschool to high school.",

        "body": "Louisiana authorities approved the state's first offshore wind agreements in the Gulf of Mexico (GoM) as it aims to install 5 gigawatts (GW) of offshore wind by 2035.\n\nThe Louisiana State Mineral and Energy Board approved an agreement with Cajun Wind, owned by Danish wind developer Vestas through its U.S. subsidiary Steelhead Americas, for 59,653 acres offshore Cameron Parish.\n\nThe state also approved Diamond Offshore Wind La.'s (DOW Wind) property agreement for 6,162 acres offshore Terrebonne and Lafourche parishes. DOW Wind is a wholly-owned subsidiary of Mitsubishi Corp.'s Diamond Generating Corp.\n\n\"For generations, the state of Louisiana has been a leader in energy production, and offshore wind energy is the next chapter in that great history as we expand our options for clean energy production and open new avenues for the development of our state economy,\" Louisiana Gov. John Bel Edwards said in a statement.\n\nLouisiana Department of Natural Resources Secretary Tom Harris said the state broke new trails in negotiating the agreements.\n\nEach agreement had different payment structures to the state. DOW Wind will contribute more in upfront costs and rental fees per acre to the state, while Cajun Wind had a lower per-acre fee for upfront and rental payments by higher royalty over the length of the agreement. DOW Wind paid $308,101 upfront, compared to Cajun Wind's $357,923.\n\n\"I believe we have established that we can be flexible in how we set up payment structures while still ensuring that the state and its people are appropriately compensated for using our resources,\" Harris said. \"Legislation passed in recent years clarifying and codifying rules on leasing state offshore areas for wind energy projects helped Louisiana draw interest from operators.\"\n\nLouisiana is setting the pace for wind development in the Gulf of Mexico. If the state is successful in its ambitions of reaching 5 GW in offshore wind capacity by 2035, it will be enough to power more than 800,000 homes.\n\nThough the agreements approved this week are in state waters, federal territory in the Gulf of Mexico are expected to be home to fixed-bottom offshore wind turbines.\n\nEarlier this year, RWE was the lone high-bidder for a lease offshore Lake Charles in the first U.S. GoM offshore wind lease auction. The company, which placed a winning bid of $5.6 million, said its lease area has a capacity for up to 2 GW of wind power.\n\nHere's a look at other renewable energy news this week:\n\nRELATED\n\nThe Great Lithium Rush: Oil and Gas Companies Turn Prospectors\n\nSurvey: Focus Remains on Energy Transition But Challenges Mount\n\nNations Strike Deal at COP28 to Transition Away From Fossil Fuels\n\nExclusive: NOV Applying Oil Drilling Tech to Hot Rock\n\nFlying the Decarbonized Skies: United Airlines Exec Talks SAF\n\nU.S.-based lithium tech company Livent said Dec. 14 it acquired a minority stake in the parent company of ILiAD Technologies, a direct lithium extraction (DLE) firm aiming to commercialize its integrated lithium adsorption desorption technology platform.\n\nILiAD Technologies' parent company is a subsidiary of EnergySource Minerals (ESM), which develops lithium projects in California's Salton Sea Known Geothermal Resource Area, according to a news release.\n\nLivent said it will have the right to license ILiAD's technology for planned deployment at Salar del Hombre Muerto, Livent's lithium brine resources in Argentina. ILiAD's technology can be used to recover high-purity lithium chloride from salars, produced water, geothermal brine operations and other lithium resources, the release stated.\n\n\"Our technology enhances the lithium extraction process with a fraction of the physical footprint of traditional operations, significantly less water use and lower carbon emissions than many other DLE solutions and no consumption of reagents,\" ILiAD Technologies CEO Samuel Moore said. \"This partnership represents a major step in our mission to deploy ILiAD for environmentally responsible lithium production across the world.\"\n\nCommercial utilization of ILiAD at Livent could begin as early as 2025, Livent said.\n\nThe Everfuel and Hy24 joint venture said Dec. 15 it signed the final agreement with Danish authorities regarding its Power-to-X (PtX) tender award for green hydrogen production and supply.\n\nThe tender's built-in subsidy, which runs for 10 years and is dependent on the project's performance, will support operating expenses. The grant is valued at about $31 million, according to a news release.\n\n\"Echoing previous statements, the Danish PtX tender is a confirmation of the government's commitment to unfold the national hydrogen production and export potential,\" said Jacob Krogsgaard, founder and CEO of Everfuel.\n\nPtX projects essentially turn electricity into other projects. With green hydrogen, clean energy such as wind and solar are used to power electrolysis to create green hydrogen, which can be converted to products such as ammonia and methanol.\n\n\"The tender for large-scale green hydrogen production and supply is the first of its kind and supports Denmark's power-to-X strategy to build upwards of 4-6 GW electrolyzer capacity,\" the release stated.\n\nUK to Back 11 Green Hydrogen Projects Under $2.5B Fund\n\nBritain's Energy Security Secretary Claire Coutinho announced on Dec. 14 that the U.K. is backing 11 projects to produce green hydrogen, as part of the government's $2.5 billion funding to be committed over the next 15 years.\n\nThe 11 successful projects, with capacity totaling 125 megawatts (MW), were selected to be offered contracts under the government's first hydrogen allocation round (HAR1), launched in July 2022.\n\nBritain has a target to reach net zero emissions by 2050 and green hydrogen, made by using renewable energy to split water, is seen as one of the key sectors that will help achieve this target and provide cleaner fuel for energy intensive industries and transport.\n\n\"Hydrogen presents a massive economic opportunity for the U.K., unlocking over 12,000 jobs and up to 11 billion pounds of investment by 2030,\" Coutinho said.\n\n\"Today's announcement represents the largest number of commercial scale green hydrogen production projects announced at once anywhere in Europe,\" she added.\n\nIn return for government support, the successful projects will invest over 400 million pounds in the next three years, generating more than 700 jobs in local communities across the U.K. and delivering 125 MW of new hydrogen for businesses.\n\nThe 11 projects have been agreed at a weighted average strike price of 241 pounds per megawatt hour (MWh).\n\nStoregga and Scottish Power's Cromarty hydrogen scheme is among the list of projects set to receive a guaranteed price for its output.\n\nRELATED\n\nMasdar, Verbund to Explore Large-scale Green Hydrogen Production\n\nMaryland-based Standard Solar said Dec. 12 it acquired the 9.9-MW Bluebonnet behind-the-meter solar project from EDF Renewables North America, marking its entry to the Texas renewable market.\n\nLocated in McGregor, Texas, southwest of Waco, the Bluebonnet project is expected to be complete in second-quarter 2024. During construction, EDF Renewables' Distribution-Scale Power team will continue to serve as EPC contractor, according to the news release.\n\nThe greenfield project will feature bifacial modules on single-axis trackers, providing about 25,000 MWh of clean energy annually.\n\n\"This marks the fourth collaboration between Standard Solar and EDF Renewables in the past 2-3 years, including projects such as Lawsbrook, Knox and Lehigh University,\" Eric Partyka, director of business development for Standard Solar, said in the release.\n\nStandard said the project will power part of an industrial process load for industrial gases company Messer Americas in Texas. The facility will mark the first time a direct connect solar energy system has mostly powered an air separation unit, according to Chris Ebeling, executive vice president of sales and marketing, for Messer Americas' U.S. bulk operations.\n\nWith the acquisition, Standard now operates in 23 states.\n\nFrance's TotalEnergies and partners started constructing a 216-MW solar farm with a 500 MWh battery storage system in South Africa, according to a Dec. 15 news release.\n\nThe site, located in the Northern Cape province, will provide more than 400 gigawatt hours (GWh) per year of renewable electricity over 20 years to the South African national grid. The storage system will also provide Eskom, the national utility, with 75 MW of dispatchable power, TotalEnergies said in a news release. The project is expected to begin operating in 2025.\n\n\"Thanks to its innovative hybrid design, it will enable us to supply continuous green electricity over a longer period and beyond the hours of sunshine,\" Vincent Stoquart, senior vice president of renewables for TotalEnergies, said in the release. \"This project will not only contribute to the country's energy transition, but also to strengthening the resilience of its power system.\"\n\nThe project is being developed by TotalEnergies and partners Hydra Storage Holding and Reatile Renewables.\n\nThe Biden administration said Dec. 11 it is proposing an offshore wind lease sale in the Central Atlantic, offering development rights across nearly 278,000 acres with the potential to power more than 2.2 million homes.\n\nThe proposal, which comes amid efforts to boost offshore wind capacity to 30 GW by 2030, includes one area covering 101,443 acres offshore Delaware and Maryland and a 176,505-acre area offshore Virginia, the U.S. Interior Department said in a news release. The proposal also comes as the offshore wind industry grapples with higher costs and supply chain constraints.\n\n\"Since the start of our administration, the Department of the Interior has approved the nation's first six commercial-scale offshore wind energy projects,\" said Secretary Deb Haaland. \"Today's announcement is another step forward in the Biden-Harris administration's pursuit of a clean energy future,\"\n\nSo far, the U.S. has held four offshore wind lease auctions during the current administration, including offshore New York, in the Pacific and Gulf of Mexico. The record-setting New York Bight lease sale brought in $4.4 billion in winning bids from six companies in February 2022. The nation's first offshore wind sale in Pacific Ocean sale in December 2022 brought in more than $757 million in winning bids for five lease areas; however, the first-ever federal wind auction in the Gulf of Mexico ended with only one winning bid. The single high bid was for $5.6 million.\n\nThe Interior Department said it will get comments on the proposed Central Atlantic sale during a 60-day public comment period, which begins following publication of the proposed sale notice in the Federal Register. The U.S. Bureau of Ocean Energy Management is also seeking feedback on bidding credits to bidders involving workforce training programs, the domestic offshore wind supply chain and a fisheries compensatory mitigation fund.\n\nAdditional areas offshore Maryland are also being considered for future leasing, the BOEM announced separately. Identified acreage will be analyzed further and considered as a wind energy area for possible inclusion in a wind lease sale as early as 2025, BOEM said.\n\nHeavy lifting company Sarens has been commissioned by Virginia International Terminals to receive and load out monopiles, jackets and transition pieces for Dominion Energy's 176-turbine Coastal Virginia Offshore Wind project, according to a news release.\n\nThe job is expected to last until 2025. Construction of the 2.6-GW wind farm is expected to be complete in 2026.\n\nIn October, the Sarens team unloaded the project's first eight monopiles from shipping saddles on the Sun Shine vessel after they arrived at the Portsmouth Marine Terminal from Rostock in Germany. The monopiles were put in temporary storage before they are moved to their final destination.\n\nWhen complete, the wind farm is expected to provide renewable energy to as many as 660,000 customers at peak output, according to Dominion.\n\nHalliburton Labs, a clean technology accelerator program that brings together entrepreneurs, academics and investors, has welcomed seven more startups.\n\nThe subsidiary of Halliburton Co. said Dec. 13 that Airovation Technologies, Ayrton Energy, Cache Energy, CENS, Disa Technologies, Marel Power Solutions and XtraLit have joined its collaborative environment.\n\n\"We are pleased to welcome these promising energy startups and provide customized support to help them achieve their specific priorities, accelerate commercialization and increase valuation,\" Halliburton Labs Managing Director Dale Winger said in a news release. \"Our experienced practitioners and network will help these companies use their time and capital efficiently.\"\n\nThe companies specialize in a variety of clean energy technologies that can help reduce greenhouse gas emissions.\n\nAirovation Technologies' proprietary carbon mineralization technology targets hard-to-abate industries in efforts to reduce emissions with carbon capture and utilization.

        "title": "Masha Gessen will receive Hannah Arendt Prize after all, following controversy over Gaza essay - Jewish Telegraphic Agency",
        "body": "(JTA) - The writer Masha Gessen will still receive a prestigious award named for Hannah Arendt, after the German foundation that administers the prize had initially said it would pull its support due to Gessen's recent writing on Gaza.\n\nGessen, a Jewish writer for The New Yorker magazine, published an essay last week comparing the Gaza Strip to Nazi-era Jewish ghettos, sparking backlash from Jewish and pro-Israel activists in Germany. That led the Heinrich Böll Foundation to say that it would no longer support a ceremony for Gessen receiving the award named for Arendt, a 20th-century German Jewish thinker and author.\n\nBut on Friday, the foundation told the Jewish Telegraphic Agency that Gessen will still get the award, including 10,000 euros in prize money, and that the author should still be honored.\n\n\"We want to make it very clear that we do not want to strip Masha Gessen of the award, or deny them the prize, and that we honor the relevance of their work,\" the foundation said in a statement. \"Gessen deserves great merit for their unconditional commitment to democracy and to debating uncomfortable issues. We greatly appreciate Gessen's critical work, their demonstrated passion for freedom and commitment to defy any autocratic tendencies.\"\n\nThe award is given annually to political theorists who continue the philosophical tradition of Arendt. Gessen is a refugee from the former Soviet Union and the descendant of Holocaust survivors. They have been widely acclaimed for their writing on the Russia-Ukraine war and LGBTQ issues.\n\nThe foundation's initial objections, and those of the German city of Bremen that co-administers the prize, stemmed from a Dec. 9 New Yorker essay by Gessen entitled \"In The Shadow Of The Holocaust.\" In the piece, Gessen critiqued modern German, Polish and Ukrainian approaches to Holocaust memory, and also castigated Israeli policy toward Gaza.\n\n\"For the last seventeen years, Gaza has been a hyperdensely populated, impoverished, walled-in compound where only a small fraction of the population had the right to leave for even a short amount of time -- in other words, a ghetto,\" Gessen wrote. \"Not like the Jewish ghetto in Venice or an inner-city ghetto in America but like a Jewish ghetto in an Eastern European country occupied by Nazi Germany.\"\n\nThey added: \"The ghetto is being liquidated.\"\n\nFollowing the essay's publication, the German-Israeli Society's Bremen chapter criticized Gessen's comparison of Gaza to Jewish ghettos, which society chair Hermann Kuhn wrote could have \"only one explanation: a deep-seated and fundamental negative prejudice against the Jewish state.\" Kuhn also took issue with Gessen's stance on Germany's approach to the Boycott, Divestment, Sanctions movement against Israel, which the German government has defined as antisemitic.\n\nIn an open letter calling on the prize's administrators to refrain from honoring Gessen, the society wrote that giving them the award \"would honor a person whose thinking is in clear contrast to Hannah Arendt's.\" Founding members of the prize also campaigned against Gessen receiving it due to their \"statements about the Middle East conflict,\" in a letter quoted by the German newspaper Die Zeit.\n\nSubsequently, Bremen's Senate announced it would be pulling out of a planned ceremony for the award, and the foundation said it would no longer sponsor it. But then it backtracked and attributed its decision to a lack of a venue for the ceremony. Later, on Friday, it said that it objected to Gessen's characterization of Gaza but that they should not be stripped of the award.\n\n\"We disagree with this statement, and fully reject it,\" the foundation said regarding Gessen's comparison of Gaza to a Nazi-era ghetto. \"The award ceremony would not have been an appropriate place for an earnest dialogue on the culture of remembrance, which is why we are trying to find another format with Masha Gessen in which a more substantive discussion can be had.\"\n\nThe awards ceremony, originally scheduled for Friday, has been postponed to Saturday in light of the foundation's departure, but will reportedly still be presented on a smaller scale. According to Gessen, it will also lack many of the trappings usually associated with the award, including a promised lecture at Bremen University.\n\nGessen did not respond to multiple JTA requests for comment, including about the foundation's statement on Friday. They told Middle East Eye in an article published earlier Friday that the New Yorker essay, which quoted Arendt, accorded with Arendt's writing and thought.\n\n\"Hannah Arendt wouldn't have gotten the Hannah Arendt prize if you applied those kinds of criteria to it,\" Gessen said. \"She was very insistent on comparing the Israeli policies and Israeli ideologies to the Nazis. And her project was very much what I'm building on, which is you have to compare in order to identify dangerous similarities.\"\n\nIn an interview prior to the prize controversy, Gessen told the same German paper that Arendt was a major inspiration for them. Gessen was also recently placed on a wanted list in Russia and accused by the Kremlin of spreading false information about the Russian Army, accusations which American journalism institutions have said are meritless.\n\nThe Craig Newmark Graduate School of Journalism at the City University of New York, where Gessen teaches, said in a statement Monday, \"We categorically reject the criminal investigation of Professor Gessen,\" adding that Russia's \"persecution is part of the broader effort to stifle independent journalism.\"\n\nControversy over responses to the Israel-Gaza war has caused turmoil across the world of arts and letters. Last month, a Jewish sponsor pulled out of the National Book Awards after learning that nominees planned to issue a statement criticizing Israel and calling for a ceasefire during the ceremony. The incident followed a controversy at the New York City Jewish cultural center 92NY in which it canceled a planned talk by an author who had signed a letter critical of Israel's actions in Gaza, leading to resignations at the center; a similar sequence of events unfolded at the magazine Artforum.\n\nGessen's Holocaust essay also criticizes Germany's formal policy of considering the BDS movement antisemitic. They report that German officials have frequently gone after intellectuals and activists who invoke the campaign. Gessen also criticizes Israel's own alliances with far-right factions in Germany and Poland and its refusal to overtly align with Ukraine in that country's war against Russia.\n\nAt one point, the essay quotes Arendt's own 1940s-era writings that compared future Israeli Prime Minister Menachem Begin's political party to the Nazis. Germany's policies combating antisemitism have been criticized by some left-leaning intellectuals for being overly harsh toward critics of Israel.\n\nThe Heinrich Böll Foundation is allied with Germany's Green Party and has offices in Tel Aviv, Ramallah, Washington, D.C., and other locations. On its Israel website, the foundation backs a two-state solution, condemns the Hamas attacks and notes \"the disastrous humanitarian situation in Gaza\" and \"the suffering and pain of the Palestinians in Gaza and the West Bank.\"",

        "title": "Can GOOG, META and SNAP extend gains in 2024 as Ad Market picks up steam?",
        "body": "With digital advertisement eyeing further recovery and artificial intelligence dominating news, analysts said companies including Alphabet (NASDAQ:GOOG) and Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) are expected to report strong results for the year-ahead, making them a long-term investment opportunity.\n\nOnline advertisement, which makes a good chunk of Google and Meta's sale, has shown stability this year following a disappointing slump in 2022, helping the tech giants report upbeat results for the third quarter.\n\nAlphabet posted a 9.5% rise in ad revenue for the third-quarter, while Meta said ad impressions across all its platforms during the quarter increased 31%, although the average price per ad decreased 6%.\n\nWall Street and Seeking Alpha analysts expect that the macro improvement and AI driven initiatives taken by these companies for better targeting and measurement could act as a catalyst for higher ad spending for the year ahead, benefiting Alphabet, Meta, Snap (NYSE:SNAP) and Pinterest (NYSE:PINS).\n\nAccording to brokerage BofA, the global online ad industry is expected to grow 12% to $629 billion in 2024, while Morgan Stanley analysts expect US online advertising growth to accelerate to about 12.5% in 2024 from near 8% this year.\n\nJ.P. Morgan listed Alphabet as one of its top picks for 2024, with analyst Doug Anmuth expecting improvements in search and YouTube growth based on AI tools, secular shift to digital advertising, continued monetization of YouTube Shorts and favorable comparisons.\n\nSimilarly, a recent Seeking Alpha analysis pointed out that the \"growth of advertising spending on Meta Platform's social-media platforms, improvement with respect to operating income margins and a linked recovery in free cash flow will be narratives for 2024.\"\n\nSeeking Alpha analysts, Wall Street as well as Seeking Alpha's Quant ratings are bullish on both GOOG and META and consider them Buy and above. The profitability prospect is lifting the score for both companies.\n\nShares of META have rose more than 160% since the start of the year, while GOOG rose 48% amid solid quarterly numbers and investors' enthusiasm over AI, easily outpacing 23% rise in the broader S&P Index.\n\nA favorable outlook for the advertisement industry also led analysts to have a bullish view on Snapchat-owner Snap and image-sharing platform Pinterest.\n\nAlthough, Meta and Snap in October gave warning regarding volatility and softness in ad demand correlating with the start of the Israel-Hamas conflict and an uncertain economy, investors were still impressed by solid quarterly numbers from PINS and SNAP - an indication that both social media companies are an attractive digital marketing platform for advertisers.\n\nJefferies sees material upside for earnings with increased confidence in ad pricing tailwinds and more durable than expected user growth for PINS, while it raised 2024 and 2025 sales targets by 3% each for SNAP, citing upside revenue drivers including a deeper Amazon, increasing contribution of Snapchat+ and expansion of brand advertising products.\n\nSeeking Alpha analysts rated both SNAP and PINS a Buy. However, Seeking Alpha's Quant ratings are cautious over valuation and view both as Hold.\n\nPINS shares gained nearly 40% since its third-quarter results in October, while SNAP rose by over 70%. Overall, SNAP and PINS gained over 90% and 60% respectively so far this year.",

        "body": "Top flyweights meet up in a title unification bout on Saturday night in Glendale, Arizona Getty Images\n\nAfter a breakout 2022 for Jesse \"Bam\" Rodriguez that saw him end the year on many Fighter of the Year lists, the 23-year-old is looking to close 2023 by becoming a unified champion for the first time in his young career. Rodriguez will put his WBO flyweight championship on the line Saturday night when he faces IBF champion Sunny Edwards.\n\nRodriguez's 2022 campaign saw him pick up three wins. In February of that year, Rodriguez moved up a weight division on roughly one week's notice to face Carlos Cuadras for the vacant WBC super flyweight championship. Rodriguez got the win and became the sport's youngest active champion in the process. He would defend the title twice in 2022, beating Srisaket Sor Rungvisai and Israel Gonzalez.\n\nThis year saw Rodriguez return to flyweight, vacating his super flyweight belt in the process, where he defeated Cristian Gonzalez Hernandez to pick up the vacant WBO title. A broken jaw suffered in the Hernandez fight resulted in surgery and a layoff for Rodriguez before he was able to prepare to face Edwards in a unification battle.\n\nEdwards won his title in March 2021 with a decision win over Moruti Mthalane. Since winning the belt, Edwards has been an active champion, successfully defending the title four times. Most recently, Edwards picked up a win over Andres Campos in June.\n\nUnlike Rodriguez, who has 11 stoppage victories in 18 career wins, Edwards primarily relies on his skills to win fights on the scorecards, with only four stoppage wins across 20 fights in his undefeated career. Edwards has gone nine fights without a stoppage win.\n\nUp until Thursday's press conference, the build to the fight was rather mild. That all changed when the fighters sat in front of the media, with Edwards claiming he could have bullied Rodriguez and his team but chose not to before launching into a tirade over Edwards' association with SNAC Fighters, a nutrition program ran by Victor Conte, who was famously at the center of the BALCO steroid distribution before becoming an anti-doping advocate.\n\nEdwards repeatedly claimed Rodriguez was a cheater and suggested that if they posted someone outside of Rodriguez's room after weigh-ins, Rodriguez would be in trouble, suggesting Rodriguez would use banned IV rehydration methods to recover from the weight cut. Edwards also claimed Rodriguez and his team did not want the fight.\n\nLet's take a look at the rest of the undercard before getting to a prediction and expert pick on the main event.\n\nViewing informationDate: Dec. 16\n\nLocation: Desert Diamond Arena -- Glendale, Arizona\n\nStart time: 8 p.m. ET (Main event expected around 11:15 p.m. ET)How to watch: DAZN (subscribe now)Rodriguez vs. Edwards fight card, oddsFavoriteUnderdogWeight class\n\nJesse Rodriguez (c) -260\n\nSunny Edwards (c) +210\n\nIBF, WBO flyweight title unification\n\nMurodjon Akhmadaliev -500\n\nKevin Gonzalez +380\n\nSuper bantamweight\n\nGalal Yafai -1200\n\nRocco Santomauro +750\n\nFlyweight\n\nPeter McGrail -550\n\nJa'Rico O'Quinn +400\n\nSuper bantamweight\n\nPrediction\n\nEdwards is a tricky, speedy fighter who tries to get opponents stuck in neutral while they try to figure out the spaces and timing to catch him. Despite being younger, Rodriguez has fought better opponents and has more pop in his shots, which feels like it may make the difference in the fight. If Rodriguez can force exchanges, Edwards doesn't really have the power to back him down or make him question his willingness to go toe-to-toe.\n\nMake no mistake, in a year loaded with big fights featuring talented fighters, Rodriguez vs. Edwards deserves to be mentioned among the best fights that can be made in the sport. Both are young, talented fighters who need these kinds of fights to boost their profiles.\n\nEdwards is a very live underdog coming into the fight and could absolutely outbox Rodriguez and use his speed to keep Rodriguez from getting his game going. But Rodriguez has high fight IQ and enough skills to get the job done. Add in Rodriguez having the home-field advantage with the fight in Glendale, Arizona and you have the recipe for a close fight which Rodriguez edges out on the scorecards.

        "body": "After-hours movers: Adobe sinks following results, Alector gains on upgrade\n\nLONDON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- First Trust Global Portfolios Management Limited (âFTGPMâ) announces the declaration of the quarterly distributions for the following sub-funds of First Trust Global Funds plc,\n\nCollectively the âFundsâ and each, a âFundâ.\n\nThe Funds are advised by First Trust Advisors L.P. (âFTAâ).\n\nThe following dates apply to todayâs distribution declaration:\n\nAbout First Trust Advisors L.P.\n\nFTA is a privately owned US-based financial services firm and is registered as an investment adviser with the United States Securities and Exchange Commission. FTA acts as adviser to a range of Irish domiciled UCITS funds under the First Trust Global Funds plc umbrella. The Funds' distributors are FTGPM and First Trust Global Portfolios Limited (\"FT UK\"), an affiliate of FTA. FTGPM is the management company of First Trust Global Funds plc umbrella. FT UK was established in December 2011 as a UK-based and UK Financial Conduct Authority (\"FCA\") regulated distributor and advisor.

You may not get back all of the money you invest.\n\nMarket risk is the risk that a particular security, or shares of a fund in general may fall in value. Securities are subject to market fluctuations caused by such factors as general economic conditions, political events, regulatory or market developments, changes in interest rates and perceived trends in securities prices. Shares of a fund could decline in value or underperform other investments as a result. In addition, local, regional or global events such as war, acts of terrorism, spread of infectious disease or other public health issues, recessions, natural disasters or other events could have significant negative impact on a fund.\n\nCurrent market conditions risk is the risk that a particular investment, or shares of the fund in general, may fall in value due to current market conditions. As a means to fight inflation, the Federal Reserve and certain foreign central banks have raised interest rates and expect to continue to do so, and the Federal Reserve has announced that it intends to reverse previously implemented quantitative easing. Recent and potential future bank failures could result in disruption to the broader banking industry or markets generally and reduce confidence in financial institutions and the economy as a whole, which may also heighten market volatility and reduce liquidity. Ongoing armed conflicts between Russia and Ukraine in Europe and among Israel, Hamas and other militant groups in the Middle East, have caused and could continue to cause significant market disruptions and volatility within the markets in Russia, Europe, the Middle East and the United States. The hostilities and sanctions resulting from those hostilities have and could continue to have a significant impact on certain fund investments as well as fund performance and liquidity. The COVID-19 global pandemic, or any future public health crisis, and the ensuing policies enacted by governments and central banks have caused and may continue to cause significant volatility and uncertainty in global financial markets, negatively impacting global growth prospects. Recent and potential future bank failures could result in disruption to the broader banking industry or markets generally and reduce confidence in financial institutions and the economy as a whole, which may also heighten market volatility and reduce liquidity. There may be tracking difference between a Fund and the relevant underlying index due to the impact of annual Fund management fees. Therefore a Fund's return may not match the return of a Fund's benchmark. A Fund's holdings may be issued by companies concentrated in a particular industry or country. A Fund may invest in small capitalisation and mid capitalisation companies. Such companies may experience greater price volatility than larger, more established companies. As the Fundsâ investments may be denominated in currencies other than the Fundsâ currency, an investment in a Fund may expose you to currency risk. A Fund's Net Asset Value (NAV) is likely to have high volatility due to the portfolio composition and/or the index replication technique. As such, potential investors should be aware that a Fund's shares may change in value, and may do so in a volatile fashion; potential investors could lose money by investing in a Fund.\n\nNeither FTGPM nor any of its affiliates guarantees the performance or the future returns of a Fund. There is no guarantee that a Fund will declare dividends. For more details relating to risks of investing in the Funds, please refer to the \"Risk Factors\" section of the Fund's prospectus.\n\nImportant Information\n\nThis financial promotion is issued by FTGPM of Fitzwilliam Hall, Fitzwilliam Place, Dublin 2, D02 T292, Ireland.

        "body": "Over the past 50 years, Tucson Hebrew Academy (THA) has been at the forefront of fostering community action among its students. Through initiatives like annual volunteerism fairs, service-oriented field trips, and the impactful Passport to Peace program, five generations of students have been encouraged to learn to embody mitzvot, actively engage in Tikkun Olam, and apply these values to create positive change in their community and the world.\n\nPassport to Peace, initiated in 2008 by teacher Chris Graves and her student government, was a cornerstone for over a decade in connecting students with local and international\n\norganizations such as the Ronald McDonald House, the Trevor Project, and Replanting Trees in Israel. Thinking back on her experience as a sixth grader during the program's inception, THA alumna and second-grade teacher Adina Karp expressed, \"Passport to Peace opened my eyes to so many different organizations at an early age and really put the values of Tikkun Olam into action right on campus.\"\n\nCrucial to instilling lifelong volunteerism is THA's continued commitment to community service field trips. In the 2022-23 school year, THA partnered with Felicia's Farm to help make repairs and learn about composting. Ms. Karp reflected on how field trips both as a student and teacher inspire her to pass Jewish ideals onto her class, \"we would go to Casa Maria Soup Kitchen and listen to stories and work as a team to accomplish projects, It was a great way to bond as a class, and it's great to see it carried through in my students today.\"\n\nFor the school's 50th celebration project, the parent Community Action Team (CAT) will be\n\nhosting a Day of Chesed for students and families on Monday, January 15th, at the THA\n\ncampus. The main project will focus on packing refugee family resettlement kits for Jewish\n\nFamily and Children's Services of Southern Arizona.\n\nThe community is welcome to participate by filling a bag, available for pick-up at THA, or\n\ndonating to the event. (Donations for kits can be made through January 12th, 2024). If you'd like to contribute to the event, please email CAT or make a donation here.",

It's a great honor to be around men and women of such passion and principle: people who support limited government, the rule of law, the vigorous defense of our national borders, and the pursuit of freedom. Keep in mind that I work on Capitol Hill, where agreement on these principles isn't always easy to find.\n\nAt Heritage, our nation's founding principles still mean a lot, and for the people lucky enough to work here--whether you're an intern for the summer or part of the full-time staff--serving as the conscience of the conservative movement as well as its catalyst is a full-time responsibility. I'm glad you're a part of that, and you should be too.\n\nLast November, just a few days after the midterms, I came here to share some thoughts on what the results of that election meant; what, in my judgment, they did not mean; and how members of my party could take advantage of our new status to renew our purpose, refocus our message, and rededicate ourselves to the ideas and principles that brought us to public service in the first place.\n\nIn the eight months since then, I've learned that life in the minority provides you a little more time to think. Not necessarily a good thing, but not necessarily a bad thing, to have occasional moments to take stock. And in the minority, I've learned it's the strength of your ideas--not the rules of the House--that provide your only chance to win the argument, if not always the vote, on a given day.\n\nToo often, in the majority, the need to govern became more important than the results of our work. But what we're for and why it's right for the country are questions a minority party in Congress must ask itself if it wants to regain the trust of the American people and, eventually, the responsibility of advancing our agenda rather than stopping theirs. These are also the questions a political movement must ask itself if it hopes to remain an active participant in the battle of ideas our country is all about.\n\nProtecting the Nation\n\nI don't know that it's possible to seriously discuss our domestic goals and ideas without first addressing the matter of security. The federal government has no greater responsibility than to protect the life, liberty, and property of its citizens. And so, before we can talk about health savings accounts, marginal tax rates, or coal-to-liquids, we must first confront the issue of terrorism and security in a new age of conflict and resolution.\n\nTo do this requires a national security strategy that is thoughtful and aggressive. More than that, it requires a posture that treats the business of fighting terrorists not as a series of trials and prosecutions, but as an overarching, global strategy to counter extremism abroad and disrupt the planning and execution of terrorist activities here at home. And despite what some will tell you, the front lines of this struggle can be found in Iraq, where right now our men and women and uniform are battling, capturing, and killing members of al-Qaeda and other agents of radical Islam.\n\nIt is perhaps one of the great paradoxes of American politics that those who support an ever-expanding role for the federal government--as an arbiter of outcome, a distributor of wealth, and an engineer of social good--nonetheless reject the idea that that same government should be given the resources and support it needs to keep us safe from attack.\n\nThe enemies we are confronted with today are different from those of the previous century. They owe no allegiance to governments and hold little regard for life, liberty, or the tranquil pursuit of happiness. They are concerned with only one thing: the complete destruction of those who do not share their narrow view of the world. We must confront their tactics of terror with the same level of passion and single-minded determination that drives them to act.\n\nBut we must also realize that even if it had unlimited resources, the federal government cannot and should not be everywhere. To fill these inevitable gaps, we need a strong and coordinated effort from state and local officials. In foiling the terrorist bombings in Piccadilly Circus last month, it was not agents of the central British government acting on exclusive intelligence that prevented the possible deaths of hundreds or thousands of people. It was a squad of local rescue workers who followed their instincts and worked with national agencies to block a potentially catastrophic attack. Recognizing the realities of the threats we face, we need to allocate our scarce national resources according to metrics of risk and vulnerability, not patronage and personal favor.\n\nSecuring Our Borders\n\nOf course, even with ample resources and equipment, there are limits to what state and local officials can do. Handling our national immigration system is one of them. The Constitution is very clear about whose job it is to define our border, secure it, and make sure those who come through it are regulated, identified, verified, and deemed legal to be here.\n\nSadly, the federal government has not proven up to the task in fulfilling these basic responsibilities. Legislation passed during the last Congress in the House would have built a secure wall, sent thousands of additional federal agents to the border, and punished employers who willfully break the law. It didn't get very far in the Senate--only the part that would build a wall became law. But then again, neither did the truly dangerous bill the Senate passed last year or the equally bad proposal that was soundly rejected by House conservatives and the American people last month.\n\nYou know, you couldn't pick up a newspaper a year ago during the Hezbollah attacks on Israel without reading somewhere that the government of Lebanon was not really a government because it couldn't control its southern border. I think that's one of the definitions of whether your government is working or not, and right now, we have a lot of work to do on that.\n\nConservatives understand that America is a nation of immigrants and of opportunity, benefiting from the free and vigorous exchange of ideas, cultures, and customs. But we also know this is a nation of laws, of order, and of respect for those who came to this country the right way and followed the rules once they got here.\n\nStopping Runaway Spending\n\nRespect for the rule of law and working together to protect our homeland are responsibilities that all Americans should share. A reckless spending agenda in Washington should not be forced on the working people of our country who already pay their share. Unfortunately, the majority this year passed a federal budget plan that will raise taxes by somewhere between $250 billion and $400 billion in just five years, and this year alone, they plan to spend $115 billion more than last year.\n\nStop and think for a moment how truly incomprehensible a figure like that is. If you went on a $1,000 shopping spree today and every day thereafter until you spent just $1 billion, you would have to shop every day for the next 2,740 years. But it only takes about four hours for the government to spend $1 billion of your money--to do for you what we are told you cannot do for yourself.\n\nOver the years, the government has managed to creep into our lives in a number of new, increasingly intrusive ways as it has added to its menu of so-called essential services. Today, our government makes first contact with you before you are born and does not let go until after you die--and I mean long after.\n\nWe have programs to take care of you in the womb and programs that will be there alongside the doctor when you are born. Then you take your first steps. We have federal programs for child care, for gifted students, failing students, juvenile delinquency, and ADD. We have programs that teach kids how to swim, jog, and play tennis. We have programs that teach our young people how to do a proper sit-up and what snacks to avoid after dinner.\n\nAs you grow older, the government will help you buy a home, fix it up, and then sell it for a bigger one. When today's young workers retire, the government will send back a small portion of what you put into Social Security and use the rest now to provide services you never knew you couldn't live without. And when you die, there are programs for that too.\n\nThree generations of post-New Deal efforts to rein in the size of government have resulted in short bursts of success sandwiched in between long periods of disappointment. And, frankly, it's not hard to understand why, because while it's easy to oppose big government in the abstract, when it comes to specifics, the entrenched interests that protect every government program as if their livelihoods depend on it--and they often do--make it next to impossible to reduce spending or, heaven forbid, roll it back. Remembering the $40 billion cut in entitlements we shepherded through the last Congress, it seems we were still straining to drain the swamp with a teaspoon while liberals are now using a fire hose to restore their hallowed view of the Great Society.\n\nSo what are we to do? In order to try to get the upper hand, I have proposed that we develop a \"pay-go\" rule for the creation of new government programs and benefits. Very simply, if it is your intention to create a new government program, you must in the same bill terminate an existing government program of equal or greater size. While it would not decrease the size of government, if it's all we do, it would force a fight between advocates of new programs and those battling to keep what they have. And just maybe we will find out that neither program had a whole lot of merit in the first place.\n\nBringing Sanity to Health Care\n\nWhatever specific plan we adopt to roll back spending, we have to realize that the impact these government programs have on our society is not just measured in dollars. Everyone in this room knows that when government pays the bills, government makes the rules. It's true for all the programs I mentioned. It's true for education. And it's particularly true when it comes to the delivery of health care.\n\nFor liberals, the predictable answer to rising costs, uneven access, and diminishing quality of our nation's health care system is to spend more money and issue more government mandates and regulations. The three leading liberal candidates for our nation's most serious elected office have settled on the idea that universal, government-run health care is the solution to all our health care problems.\n\nHow that works in practice is already proven. Just take a look at the Medicare system. What a doctor gets paid for treating our seniors often has nothing to do with the cost to the doctor, but is based on a government formula. Prices do not change as a result of innovation or competition, but when a new regulation is enacted.\n\nAnd wouldn't you know it: The government almost never gets the price right. When it sets the compensation for certain procedures or services too low, you get rationing of care. When the government sets the price too high for another procedure, seniors find themselves getting tests and treatments they don't need. And just to make sure no one operated outside this perfect government system, it is actually against the law for a senior and a Medicare doctor to agree to any care or payment system outside of Medicare.\n\nSome of us have been working with groups like Heritage to find a better way--a way that recognizes that Americans want quality health care when and where they want it and that, as taxpayers, they want the best price possible when government pays. The marketplace is the only known mechanism available to deliver what people want.\n\nRather than expanding government-controlled programs, we should work to expand access to private individual health insurance. A tax deduction coupled with a tax credit for individual health insurance would expand on the success we have already seen in Medicare Part D and health savings accounts by providing a real means for millions of Americans to go into the private market and purchase the insurance that is best for them.\n\nInsurance coverage, premiums, and even payments to the doctor would be worked out in the marketplace, not by some bureaucrat. The marketplace already works to help keep costs low in other forms of insurance, like homeowners and auto. Can you imagine the guy who fixes your fender after a wreck getting paid by a government formula rather than negotiating the price with you and your insurance company? What insanity! It's time to introduce some sanity into the health care system and empower individuals to make these decisions rather than the government.\n\nMaking America Energy Independent\n\nThe right tax policies for a strong economy, health care initiatives derived from and driven by the marketplace, and energy independence will be the pillars of a new American century.\n\nAmericans' energy bills went up again this summer. Unfortunately, nearly two-thirds of our oil comes from places outside the United States these days, and a good portion of that is shipped from areas of the world where hatred for the West in general and America in particular is the rule. There is nothing wrong with buying things from people who don't like you, but it's really dumb to have to buy things from people who don't like you.\n\nYou cannot reduce our reliance on foreign energy when you refuse to tap into our own supply. You cannot substitute alternative energy for imported fossil fuels fast enough if you make it impossible to build nuclear power plants or refuse to explore and utilize the abundant resources we have off our own shores, in the Arctic, and in the form of hydrodams we already have in place. Renewables, alternatives, and conservation are also important parts of energy independence--but make no mistake: Energy independence requires actual energy.\n\nAs it stands, an energy bill produced by this Congress is more likely to increase our reliance on foreign energy and increase costs to families looking to cool down their homes or fill up their cars. That is why I believe we should require government to answer one simple question before passing any energy policy: Will it increase our domestic energy supply and reduce our reliance on foreign energy?\n\nIf we can judge proposals by that basic standard, I believe we can focus on energy policies that hold the most promise, including expanding oil, natural gas, and coal production on land and off; building our next generation of nuclear power plants; investing in biofuels; and deploying more windmills and hydrotechnology.\n\nThe bills being shuffled through any of the 11 separate House committees this summer--some of which have never even seen an energy bill before-- produce no energy and actually increase our reliance on foreign sources. These bills acknowledge not a single one of the 12 key energy principles identified by Heritage last month and, as a consequence, leave our country less able to respond to disruptions at home and more vulnerable to circumstances abroad.\n\nMore energy dependence is exactly what we don't need. Unfortunately, the congressional majority tends to believe that energy comes from a light switch and that the solutions to our nation's energy problems come from taxes, mandates, and regulations--not more supply.\n\nLooking to the Future\n\nThese are some of the challenges and opportunities that face conservatives today, and it is up to us to rise to these challenges and meet these opportunities. Yet I often feel that some parts of the Washington establishment have been paralyzed by the desire to solve every problem with either the trendiest new idea or the most complicated policy imaginable-- the less decipherable, the better.\n\nAs conservatives, we know the solutions to illegal immigration, runaway government spending, a failing health care system, and a lack of adequate domestic energy resources are found in taking the simple steps my constituents in Southwest Missouri remind me of time and time again:\n\nThese solutions may sound simple, but it is often the simplest ideas--as in life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness--that form the firmest groundwork for a revolution.\n\nThank you again for your time, your dedication, and your commitment to the realization of a future in which conservative values remain the bedrock, the foundation, the architecture, and--above all-- the driving force for revolutionary change.\n\nThe Honorable Roy Blunt represents the Seventh District of Missouri and serves as Minority Whip in the U.S. House of Representatives.",

        "title": "Travel Through Your Own Memories With The Immersive Alex Israel And BMW Experience 'REMEMBR'",
        "body": "The 21 edition of Art Basel Miami Beach is now in the books - a whirlwind week of parties, dinners, DJ sets, brand collaborations, product launches, restaurant openings and, fortunately, great weather. But at the center of it all, of course, was the art - presented in every form all throughout the Magic City.\n\nNot surprisingly, Artificial Intelligence featured prominently at this year's Art Basel (where have you gone NFT art?), and this hot new art genre was at the center of one of my most memorable experiences during this year's fair - titled, rather fittingly, REMEMBR. This AI-powered participatory video installation was a unique collaboration between renowned LA-based contemporary artist Alex Israel and BMW, a longtime sponsor of the arts in general and Art Basel in particular, in large part to promote its new fully electric BMW i5 sedan.\n\nI have had the pleasure of meeting Alex through mutual friends throughout the years and have always loved the way he uses his art to show how he sees the world around him. Israel's work, which includes paintings, sculptures, and mixed-media installations, often explores the intersection of pop culture, art, and technology - and so his involvement with BMW on this AI project was an ideal fit, synergistic well beyond the artist's fortuitous initials.\n\n\"I was really interested in doing a project with artificial intelligence. I was trying to figure it out... and then I got a call from BMW asking if I want to do a project with artificial intelligence for Art Basel Miami Beach? And I said, 'Yes, actually I do!' We decided to jump in the deep end, and here we are. I went to Munich and met with the head designer at BMW, Domagoj Dukec, and he showed me this new all-electric BMW i5.\"\n\nIncorporating artificial intelligence in a variety of ways, the electric BMW i5 \"played a significant role in the conception of this project,\" said Israel. \"I always say that my real studio is my car. I get most of my ideas while I'm driving around LA and my memories stream and fuse with my imagination to bear new ideas as the radio shuffles and the city passes me by.\"\n\n\"There are a lot of things about the car that are really interesting to me, that I felt aligned with. One of them is that when you are in the car you can select from a series of atmospheric, environmental modes called My Modes - there's one for sport, there's one for expression, there's one for relaxation. When you pick one of these modes, all the colors in the car change, and they are really meant to elevate your mood, enhance your experience. BMW and I see eye to eye on this... color can really enhance and change your mood and your vibe.\"\n\nFor the REMEMBR installation, Israel sought to embody the intersection of humans and technology by using personal photos to create art. \"The technology in the car... is designed to merge man and machine into a closer connected unit. I think we are all experiencing that with our phones. My phone is like an external hard drive for my brain. Specifically, when it comes to pictures - I have like one hundred thousand pictures and videos on my phone. I thought, 'what if there is a way to go through all these pictures and look at your life that wasn't totally tedious, that was maybe a little entertaining or fun?'\"\n\nIn seeking that goal, Israel and BMW certainly succeeded. The REMEMBR installation took place in a large room in the exhibition's Collector's Lounge, with curved walls bearing 7 extra large video screens in the shape of Israel's iconic profile-in-shades logo. At the center of the room was one of the BMW i5 vehicles, in a custom mat-blue color conceived by Israel.\n\nParticipants in the experience were asked to download a special app (and sign a waiver) which uses artificial intelligence to access all of the photos on the user's phone, and within a few minutes creates a 2-minute montage organized thematically to be played on the video screens along with choreographed music. While the AI technology filters out inappropriate or hidden photos, for volunteers (like myself) there was certainly a bit of anxiety waiting to see what a video snapshot of my life might look like, given that a room full of strangers would be viewing it along with me.\n\nI enjoyed seeing the videos produced from Israel's photos and from those of some of the others in the room. And when it was time for my montage, it was truly a treat - nothing embarrassing, just an entertaining trip down memory lane, featuring friends, family, foods, and fun times going back many years. It may not have been a masterpiece, but for me, it was an AI art experience to REMEMBR!",

        "body": "Image: Illustration by Christianity Today / Source Images: WikiMedia Commons\n\nI grew up in Japan in a household where my mother was a follower of Jesus but my father was not a believer. My mother took my siblings and me to church each week and played a central role in my faith formation. Consequently, I recall her presence in most of my Christmas memories, such as attending Christmas Eve worship services, acting in Nativity plays, and sharing about Jesus and the \"meaning\" of Christmas with others. Within my family, my mother was the primary figure who modeled Christ, and she has played an indispensable role in fostering my faith.\n\nMany Christians may resonate with my story, especially those who grew up in a family where the mother was the sole parent who followed Jesus. Indeed, a 2019 Barna study of Christian homes in the United States points to the prominent role of mothers in their children's faith. Teens consistently identified mothers as the foremost figures who pray with them and talk with them about matters relating to the Bible and faith. \"Over and over, this study speaks to the enduring impact of mothers -- in conversation, companionship, discipline and, importantly, spiritual development,\" researcher Alyce Youngblood concluded. For many believers, belief in Jesus would not have been a reality without the role and legacy of family matriarchs in their lives.\n\nThe Advent season provides an opportunity to meditate on Christ's love, but it also gives us a chance to appreciate his maternal lineage, particularly of his great-ancestor Ruth. I propose that the story of Ruth serves as an Old Testament Advent story. For Christians, Advent carries a specific connotation of \"the coming of Christ at the Incarnation.\" But the term also broadly means \"the coming of an important event, person, invention, etc.\" In this regard, the Book of Ruth looks forward to the advent of both King David and Jesus. The connection between Ruth, David, and Jesus is especially evident in Matthew's genealogy, which includes Ruth, along with four other women: Tamar, Rahab, Bathsheba, and Mary (Matt. 1:3, 5-6, 16).\n\nGod's love and character are made manifest through the female characters in the unfolding of Ruth's narrative -- a reminder that God's salvation is accomplished not simply through \"heroic\" men, but women also play a vital role in God's redemption story. Reading the Book of Ruth as an Advent story provides an opportunity for us to reflect on God's attributes especially expressed through women, both in the Bible and in our personal lives.\n\nThe Book of Ruth takes place during a spiritual and physical crisis when the Israelites have repeatedly committed \"evil in the eyes of the Lord\" (Judges 2:11). An Old Testament Advent story, it builds the expectation of a coming savior and communicates the message of faith to the Gentiles.\n\nGod's provision for people's physical and spiritual needs through a lack and fulfillment paradigm stands out in this book. Naomi, who lacks food, receives sustenance in Bethlehem. Naomi loses her husband and sons but receives a \"son\" through Ruth. Ruth, who is a widow, finds a husband. Most of all, during the days when the people lacked an earthly king, God initiated an Advent plan to provide Israel's future king.\n\nThe advent of Obed's birth (and one day Jesus') hinges not only on God's chesed (\"kindness\") but also on the chesed that human characters display to one another in the story. For instance, Naomi blesses Boaz for not abandoning her and Ruth, and Boaz praises Ruth's pursuit of him as a representation of God's steadfast love.\n\nRuth's story affirms that this love is also welcome to the Gentiles. Throughout the book, the author refers to Ruth as a \"Moabitess.\" Ruth's Moabite identity shocks the original audience, as the Moabites consistently pose a physical and spiritual threat to Israel. For instance, Balak, king of Moab, tries to curse Israel (Num. 22-24), and the Moabites lead the Israelites to worship the gods of Moab (Num. 25:1-3; Judges 10:6).\n\nIn contrast to the Moabites' negative depictions, Ruth the Moabitess enjoys inclusion into the Israelite community. She marries an Israelite and immigrates to Israel. She promises Naomi, \"Where you go I will go, and where you stay I will stay. Your people will be my people and your God my God\" (Ruth 1:16). The elders of Israel even pray that God may make Ruth like Israel's matriarchs, Rachel and Leah.\n\nRuth's commitment to God, Naomi, and Boaz results in her inclusion into the Israelite community -- despite her Moabite identity -- and the privilege of giving birth to a son, which leads to the births of King David and, ultimately, of Jesus.\n\nThus, throughout the book, God and people -- whether Israelite or Gentile -- extend and experience kindness. As an Advent story, then, the Book of Ruth paints a beautiful picture of inclusion into God's community -- one that is not strictly hereditary but open to all who believe and commit to Israel's God.\n\nBesides opening a window into the inclusivity of God's salvation plan, the Book of Ruth also points to the faithful love of God expressed through the exemplary actions of women. Especially noteworthy is the character's willingness to endure suffering, which plays an essential role in the story of Advent.\n\nThe Japanese Christian author Shusaku Endo believes that the maternal nature of Jesus appeals to Japanese non-Christians. In his book A Life of Jesus, Endo states:\n\nThe Japanese tend to seek in their gods and buddhas a warm-hearted mother. ... With this fact always in mind I tried not so much to depict God in the father-image that tends to characterize Christianity, but rather to depict the kind-hearted maternal aspect of God revealed to us in the personality of Jesus.\n\nWhat Endo refers to as the \"maternal aspect of God\" lies in Jesus' willingness to submit himself to suffering.\n\nOne of the most frequently repeated passages in the Old Testament, Exodus 34:6 reads, \"The Lord, the Lord, the compassionate and gracious God, slow to anger, abounding in love and faithfulness.\" The Hebrew term rachum, often translated as \"compassionate,\" is related to the noun rechem, which means \"womb,\" and thus implies how God expresses a mother-like nature. As this characteristic of God is often mentioned in contexts that deal with Israel's sin and rebellion, God's compassion naturally involves enduring human unfaithfulness.\n\nAlthough the term rachum does not appear in the Book of Ruth, the story nevertheless exemplifies how Ruth endures suffering with her mother-in-law. Naomi experiences much distress in losing her husband and two sons. In agony, she states that YHWH's hand \"has turned against me\" and that the Almighty \"has afflicted me\" (Ruth 1:13, 21). She even warns her daughters-in-law that she cannot remarry and that she will not be able to provide future husbands for them. She thus instructs her daughters-in-law to each return to her \"mother's home.\"\n\nDespite Naomi's warnings, Ruth decides to accompany Naomi and join her in her suffering. Ruth is said to have \"clung\" to Naomi. The Hebrew term for \"clung\" (davaq) is the same term used to express the deep commitment of a husband to his wife, as well as how people ought to \"hold fast\" to God. Even though Naomi warned Ruth of God's \"hand\" in her predicament, Ruth's confession So may YHWH deal with me reflects her resolution to share in Naomi's suffering even to the point of death. Ruth's relentless love for Naomi is later described as better than \"seven sons.\"\n\nJust as Ruth left her homeland and \"clung\" to Naomi and endured difficulties, Mary also bore, birthed, and accompanied Jesus to and from Egypt despite hardship. Jesus, through the Incarnation, took on flesh to bear our suffering, just like a mother would for her child.\n\nJust as the Gospels recount the nativity of Jesus, the Book of Ruth looks forward to the birth of King David (Ruth 4:17-22) and recounts how God provided the birth of a king during a time of rampant violence and sin. Both stories share a similar setting: a time of national disaster that highlights the world's need for a savior. They also share a similar plot line, including marriage, a child's birth, and a female figure who travels to Bethlehem. Both serve to communicate how God works through the lives and actions of ordinary people and contrasts their faithfulness with the sinful patterns of the world. The exemplary natures of these human characters anticipate Christ, who serves as the paradigm of Christian faith and conduct.\n\nThis Advent, may Christians around the world celebrate the mother-like love of God that relentlessly pursues us, willingly endures suffering with us, and graciously accepts all who repent and believe. I hope that the Advent story of Ruth encourages mothers to rekindle their commitment to \"cling\" to God and their children. May Christians extend God's love by accompanying those who are suffering in this season. And for those who are personally experiencing hardship, may you find encouragement in a God who graciously suffers for us, even to the point of sending his only begotten Son to earth for our salvation.\n\nKaz Hayashi (PhD, Baylor University) is the associate professor of Old Testament at Bethel Seminary/University in Minnesota.

        "title": "Would Reggie White have become a champion of the gay community?",
        "body": "Reggie White, the \"Minister of Defense,\" is the most recent sports figure highlighted by ESPN's award-winning 30 For 30 series, produced by NFL Films, which focuses on individuals and moments in sports that had a particular impact on the world.\n\nThe two-hour episode focuses on White's on-field success, winning a Super Bowl with the Green Bay Packers, earning two NFL Defensive Player of the Year Awards, and named first- or second-team All-Pro 13 times with two different teams, the Packers and Philadelphia Eagles.\n\nWhite, one of football's greatest defensive players to ever compete, is in the College and Pro Football Halls of Fame.\n\nYet NFL Films and ESPN made a thoughtful choice in developing this film. White was, in addition to a force on the field, also one of the most damaging people in the history of the NFL for LGBTQ people and our movement toward acceptance,\n\nDespite what I wrote almost 20 years ago, I wish he were alive today.\n\nThere are a lot of people who demonstrate an inability to grow, listen and open their hearts and minds. Tony Dungy is a great example, someone who almost 20 years ago raised money to fight against same-sex marriage, and who still today speaks out against the LGBTQ community, including my 20-year relationship with my husband.\n\nIt's impossible to know what White would say about \"homosexuals\" today, or my marriage.\n\nTo be sure, he said some terrible -- even blatantly false -- things in his day.\n\nStill, believe it or not, there is reason to have had hope.\n\nReggie White said some terrible things about gay people and AIDS\n\n\"Homosexuals are trying to compare their plight with the plight of black men, of black people,\" White told the Wisconsin Legislature in 1998. \"In the process of history, homosexuals have never been castrated, millions of them never died. Homosexuality is a decision.\"\n\nThis quote from White was false. Gay men have been castrated by many societies. While the Nazis are held out as a particular example, they have not been alone in this abhorrent behavior.\n\nWhile we don't know the exact number, it's also clear the Nazis exterminated gay people, and that it is illegal to be gay in many countries today, punishable by death.\n\nStill, White went further during his life, claiming AIDS was... well... you can see his statement for yourself:\n\n\"I think it's man's way of punishing themselves,\" he said of the disease.\n\nAwful.\n\nIn an interview with Outsports in 2013, White's former Packers teammate Leroy Butler said that, while he pointed out discrepancies in the Biblical scripture to his fellow Packers defenseman, White wasn't having it:\n\n\"I told Reggie the religious people use the Bible to their own advantage. That passage doesn't specify gay or straight. And if you go to Proverbs, He says He's the only one who can judge us. ... And Reggie would look at that and say we're going to agree to disagree.\"\n\nDid White change his mind about homosexuality?\n\nThat was before White retired, visited Israel, and reportedly educated himself further.\n\nEducation, as well as personal experience, can go a long way.\n\nSeven years after White's death, another devout Christian, Dallas Cowboys Hall of Fame receiver Michael Irvin, talked with me about his perspective of gay rights and same-sex relationships.\n\nHe had a gay brother who had died, and he saw his \"plight\" as a black man to be at least similar to that of gay people, at least in 2011.\n\n\"I don't see how any African-American with any inkling of history can say that you don't have the right to live your life how you want to live your life,\" Irvin said at the time. Just 60 years ago in America, it was illegal in many states for a black man to marry a white woman.\n\n\"No one should be telling you who you should love, no one should be telling you who you should be spending the rest of your life with. When we start talking about equality and everybody being treated equally, I don't want to know an African-American who will say everybody doesn't deserve equality.\"\n\nColor me optimistic, but after watching the 30 For 30 \"Minister of Defense\" on ESPN -- in which I played a part -- it seems to me that White was on a journey similar to Irvin, a man of faith who knew what he was being told by religious people with power wasn't quite right, and that embracing LGBTQ people as people, and ditching the judgment, was part of Christianity.\n\nOver the years, reports have surfaced from some friends and family about White talking about broader love and acceptance -- modeled by Jesus Christ himself -- realizing that many of the values he had been taught by some preachers had been wrong or misleading.\n\nSpecifically, some have asserted that, in his final weeks, he vilified gay people much less, finding love and compassion instead of judgment.\n\nCould White have been a role model for a more welcoming version of Christianity?\n\nThe sadness in his loss 20 years ago, for gay people, is that he exhibited the potential to build real bridges, focusing on love instead of division.\n\nSadly, we'll never really know. White was taken away from the world far too early, dying of arrhythmia, a condition I deal with.\n\nIf I had to place a bet? I'd guess White would have come around to a more-welcoming version of Christianity than the one he preached.\n\nI've talked publicly about my wonderful born-again aunt and uncle, Sandy and Jeff. They don't entirely agree with me on what their God will tell me when I arrive, knocking on the door of heaven. And they share that with me.\n\nThey also share their devoted love for my husband and me. They tell me that they love me and support me. I know if I needed someone, if we were in dire straights, they would be there to help.\n\nThat, it seems, is all we can ask of people who -- taught to their core by homophobes -- believe same-sex relationships are \"sin.\" We can, at that point, only hope for love and compassion (and that their vote doesn't stand in the way of equality).\n\nToday, I feel like White would be right there. I bet he'd be a lot like Irvin, embracing his Christianity while at the same time making sure that gays and lesbians knew they were loved.\n\nI don't know, but it's a hunch.\n\nSo yeah, almost two decades later, I am sad White isn't with us, despite what I wrote then. Today, I see his potential for growth. Two decades later, I see the entire Western world growing, and I imagine he'd be part of that.\n\nHe was headed to a place of centering love and acceptance, much like Irvin and my aunt and uncle. I wish we could all see where he might have ended up.",

But an organization in south Florida is working to make them a reality. Ahead of the holidays each year, volunteers at Jewish Adoption and Family Care Options work to make the wishes of foster kids come true.\n\n\"A lot times at the holidays, children in foster care just get random gifts from very well-intended, generous people in the community, but there's lots of puzzles and lots of Barbie dolls and that's not necessarily what they would want in their heart,\" JAFCO's CEO Sarah Franco told CBS News. \"And I'm not sure that the children in our care have ever had a wish come true on the holidays, necessarily.\"\n\nEach year, JAFCO holds a Hanukkah Gift Drive, where people can buy presents from kids' wish lists.

        "body": "By Imogen Howse via SWNS\n\nDespite the 'beer goggles' effect, drunk people don't think faces are more attractive, a new study reveals.\n\nPrevious research showed that alcohol blurred the appearance of symmetrical, more attractive faces and less attractive ones.\n\nBut a new study shows that whilst booze does indeed have that effect, drunk people still don't think faces are any better looking.\n\nNow scientists believe the 'beer goggles' effect is still real but there is more to it than simply facial attractiveness.\n\nThe team conducted an experiment in a local pub in Portsmouth where they asked 99 men and women between the ages of 18 and 62 to rate a group of faces for attractiveness and symmetry.\n\nEach face was shown in two forms: one in its natural state, and one with 'enhanced symmetry'.\n\nParticipants had to first-rate each picture individually before later being presented with two versions of the same face and having to judge which was more attractive and which was more symmetrical.\n\nAs predicted, heavily intoxicated individuals were less able to distinguish natural faces from perfectly symmetrized faces.\n\nHowever, contrary to popular opinion, this did not have any influence on facial attractiveness judgments - suggesting that 'beer goggles' are not actually linked to facial symmetry or asymmetry, with many other factors possibly at play.\n\nDr. Alistair Harvey, a psychology professor at the University said: \"We don't deny the existence of a 'beer goggles' effect.\n\n\"But we suspect it would be more easily detectable when using live models for an experiment, instead of static photographs.\n\n\"Images conceal a range of important visual criteria for attractiveness, including build, body shape, height, expression, and clothing.\"\n\nThe previous explanation was that 'the more symmetry, the better the gene pool'.\n\nBut Dr. Harvey added: \"Alcohol is a strong predictor of sexual behavior, often consumed before or during dates.\n\n\"There are a range of possible reasons why alcohol drinkers are more inclined to engage in sex, including a lack of inhibition, heightened expectations, personality traits, and the 'beer goggles' effect.\n\n\"Due to the limited research on this topic, we ran a field experiment to help determine why people often experience unexpected - and regretted - sexual escapades after having one too many.\n\n\"Further research is needed to find the missing piece to the puzzle.\"\n\nThe experiment, which has been published in the Journal of Psychopharmacology, also presented participants with 'natural' faces and faces that had been doctored to look 'wonky' or asymmetrical.\n\nHere, as expected, both men and women rated natural faces as more attractive, but, to the researchers' surprise, the bias was stronger among women.\n\nMore from this section Mexico's Maya Train May Bring Economical Hope for Some, but Ecological Disaster for Many Kaoshiung Taxi Drivers Protest New Pedestrian Safety Laws - TaiwanPlus News Israel tells top US official war will last 'months'",

        "title": "Masha Gessen: 'It's absurd. Hannah Arendt wouldn't have gotten the Hannah Arendt prize under those criteria'",
        "body": "Masha Gessen speaks onstage at the 2020 Sundance Film Festival - Truth To Power Panel at Filmmaker Lodge on January 25, 2020 in Park City, Utah (AFP)\n\nMasha Gessen, a prominent Russian-American journalist and LGBTQ campaigner, has become the latest person to be caught up in Germany's long-running national tussle over how to reconcile its historical guilt with its attitude to the Israel-Palestine conflict.\n\nThe controversy began after it was announced that Gessen was set to win the Hannah Arendt Prize for Political Thought, a prize named in honour of the German-Jewish writer and thinker who is most renowned for coining the term \"banality of evil\" in her work reporting on the trial of Nazi war criminal Adolf Eichmann.\n\nOn Wednesday, the Heinrich Boll Foundation - which was sponsoring the prize - announced its withdrawal from sponsoring the prize, citing an essay by Gessen called \"In The Shadow of the Holocaust\" written for the New Yorker magazine. In tandem, the city of Bremen also said it had withdrawn support, denying the prize committee a venue for the award ceremony.\n\n\"You've got to me fucking kidding me,\" was Gessen's first reaction.\n\nSpeaking to Middle East Eye from Bremen, the writer said after some wrangling, the organisers had managed to reorganise the giving of the prize for Saturday, albeit in a much more pared-down format, with much of the ceremony stripped out, including a planned reception at the Bremen mayor's house and a talk at Bremen University.\n\n\"The university concluded they couldn't have the discussion because they would be in violation of something, probably the non-binding BDS resolution,\" they said, referencing a resolution passed by the German parliament in May 2019 that branded as \"antisemitic\" the Boycott Divestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement that aims to pressure Israel to adhere to international law.\n\n\"I don't know whether the prize money is still attached to the prize or not,\" Gessen added.\n\nTheir essay for the New Yorker, which makes a comparison between the current situation in the Gaza Strip and the conditions of the Warsaw Ghetto, discusses the notion of the \"singularity of the Holocaust\" and the concept of the atrocity as \"an event that Germans must always remember and mention but don't have to fear repeating\".\n\nThere are many layers of irony to the controversy.\n\nGessen is Jewish and lost numerous family members in the Holocaust, and is also non-binary, having repeatedly had to flee Vladimir Putin's Russia, including over fears that they and their partner's children could be removed from them by the state as a result of the government anti-LGBTQ legislation.\n\n'It is too absurd. Hanna Arendt wouldn't have gotten the Hannah Arendt prize if you applied those kinds of criteria to it'\n\n- Masha Gessen\n\nAs someone who has had direct experience of the kind of repression that Arendt spoke out against so fervently in her lifetime, the outcry over her article appears bewildering.\n\nGessen said they had been joking with some German friends in Berlin in November that the prize would be revoked.\n\n\"Somehow they thought that would be just too absurd - and of course it is too absurd. Hannah Arendt wouldn't have gotten the Hannah Arendt prize if you applied those kinds of criteria to it,\" they said.\n\n\"She was very insistent on comparing the Israeli policies and Israeli ideologies to the Nazis. And her project was very much what I'm building on, which is you have to compare in order to identify dangerous similarities.\"\n\nGermany has long struggled to come to terms with its 20th-century history, primarily how it relates to the legacy of the Holocaust, which saw six million Jews, as well as millions of others, killed in death camps by the Nazi regime.\n\nSupporting Israel is a cornerstone of German foreign policy with the former chancellor, Angela Merkel, declaring it to be a staatsrason - reason of state - even backing the state's actions when condemnations were issued by Berlin's European allies.\n\nThis has made pro-Palestinian perspectives in the country often very difficult to articulate without being branded antisemitic.\n\nGessen argues that Germany's \"memory culture\" is unhealthy for the country, for Jewish people, and for the Palestinians, and fails to actually learn the lessons that needed to be learned from the Holocaust.\n\nThey pointed out that Arendt, in her time, faced many of the same criticisms. In her most famous work, Eichmann in Jerusalem, she punctured the idea of the uniquely evil quality that many attributed to Nazi officials, suggesting they were often - as in the case of Eichmann himself - fundamentally mundane people, even jobsworths.\n\n\"They saw her - completely misguidedly - as trivialising the Holocaust, when what she was saying was that out of shallow things, out of trivial things, out of things which seem ridiculous, a massive evil can arise,\" explained Gessen.\n\nMuch of the criticism Gessen faced has stemmed from the German-Israel Society (DIG), which said handing Gessen the award would \"contradict the necessary decisive action against the growing antisemitism\" in the country, and said the comparisons made by Gessen were in \"clear contrast to Hannah Arendt's thinking.\"\n\nArendt, originally an ardent Zionist, made direct comparisons between fascism and Israeli actions.\n\nIn 1948, she was a signatory along with a number of other Jewish intellectuals, including Albert Einstein, to a letter that denounced as \"fascist\" the new political party of Menachem Begin, who would later become prime minister of Israel and whose political successors included the Likud party of current Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu.\n\n'[Arendt] was saying was that out of shallow things, out of trivial things, out of things which seem ridiculous, a massive evil can arise'\n\n- Masha Gessen\n\nThey also referred to the actions of Begin's Irgun militia, specifically the 1948 Deir Yassin massacre that saw at least 100 Palestinian villagers killed by the Irgun and their allies.\n\nGessen said that the current controversy had at times felt like \"my birthday\" because they found themselves in the company of so many others, particularly Jewish intellectuals, who had faced censure for talking about these issues.\n\n\"To have a few hours in which Judith Butler, Naomi Klein and Eyal Weizman and a few dozen others who I respect more than anyone else in the world reaching out to me and saying about being in the same boat or just extending their support - it's quite extraordinary,\" they explained.\n\nLooking to the future, they worry that right-wing political movements will continue to co-opt genuine fears of Jews over rising antisemitism to secure their support and push for authoritarian legislation.\n\n\"The inconvenient part of it is things like what happened to me happening...but there's something else going on, which is that antisemitism is a real thing, and it includes violent incidents and truly dangerous incidents, and when those incidents are lumped together with what Germans call anti-Israeli antisemitism - which isn't antisemitism at all - that dilutes the definition of antisemitism,\" they said.",

        "title": "Plenary round-up - December 2023 | Epthinktank | European Parliament",
        "body": "The highlight of the December plenary session was Parliament's award of the 2023 Sakharov Prize to Jina Mahsa Amini and the Woman, Life, Freedom Movement in Iran.\n\nWritten by Clare Ferguson and Katarzyna Sochacka.\n\nThe highlight of the December plenary session was Parliament's award of the 2023 Sakharov Prize to Jina Mahsa Amini and the Woman, Life, Freedom Movement in Iran. Members held a debate with the Council and European Commission on the preparation of the European Council meeting of 14-15 December 2023 and reviewed the Spanish Presidency of the Council. Further debates took place on Council and Commission statements on Parliament's call for the right to disconnect, the defence of democracy package, European economic security strategy and the planned dissolution of key anti-corruption structures in Slovakia and the implications for the rule of law. Members also debated the European defence investment programme, and discussed Frontex in the light of the fact-finding mission of Parliament's working group for Frontex scrutiny. Members debated the outcome of the 2023 United Nations Climate Change Conference in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (COP28). Debates were held on statements by the High Representative of the Union for Foreign Affairs and Security Policy, among other topics, on the need to release all hostages, to achieve a humanitarian ceasefire and prospects for a two-state solution in Israel; and in the presence of Commission Vice-President Valdis Dombrovskis, on the environmental consequences of Russia's aggression against Ukraine.\n\nMembers awarded Parliament's 2023 Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought to the late Jina Mahsa Amini and the Woman, Life, Freedom Movement in Iran. Jina Mahsa Amini's family members were prevented from leaving Iran and could not take part in the ceremony at the European Parliament in Strasbourg. Amini family lawyer and representative, Saleh Nikbakht, and Afsoon Najafi and Mersedeh Shahinkar, Iranian women's rights defenders, therefore received the prize on behalf of the family.\n\nA secure supply of critical raw materials (CRMs) is essential if the EU is to transition to 'net-zero' and the digital age. Members debated and adopted the text on the proposed critical raw materials act agreed in interinstitutional negotiations by Members of the Committee on Industry, Research and Energy (ITRE). To ensure supplies are secure and sustainable, the agreed text requires the EU to extract, process and recycle a certain amount of 'strategic' raw materials (SRMs) itself, and emphasises diversifying the EU's SRM imports. The agreed text adds aluminium to the SRM list, increases the benchmark for EU SRM recycling capacity, and adds rules on waste streams.\n\nIn the wake of the pandemic and the issues this raised for personal health data, the European Commission proposes to ensure individuals have easy access to their health data and that healthcare systems can exchange data efficiently, by creating a European health data space (EHDS). Parliament debated and adopted a joint Committee on the Environment, Public Health and Food Safety (ENVI) and Committee on Civil Liberties, Justice and Home Affairs (LIBE) report on the EHDS proposal, which sets Parliament's position for interinstitutional negotiations. The report calls for stronger rights for citizens to access and control their data and to set a framework for data re-use across the Union. It would also create a right for citizens to obtain a remedy against binding decisions by a digital health authority. The report demands that people can opt out from sharing their data, and that personal electronic health data are stored within the EU.\n\nAs driver fatigue is a major danger to all road users, the EU wants to improve minimum requirements for commercial drivers' breaks and rest periods for occasional passenger transport in the tourism sector. Members debated and adopted a Committee on Transport and Tourism (TRAN) report, which welcomes the Commission proposals on breaks and rest periods, but requires changes to the way break and rest periods are split. It also calls for better multilingual facilities for uploading digital journey forms. The adopted report sets Parliament's position for negotiations with the Council.\n\nBreakfast is an important meal in a healthy lifestyle and the EU's marketing standards on breakfast foods seek to ensure they are top quality. The EU is proposing to revise the 'breakfast directives', a group of standards for labelling of foods often consumed at breakfast: honey, jams, jellies and juices. Members adopted an ENVI committee report setting Parliament's position on the proposal. The report proposes stricter rules on honey labelling and a traceability system. The committee emphasises that 'no added sugar' statements should not lead to increased sweetener content or claims of beneficial health effects.\n\nWhen travelling between EU countries, some parents continue to face issues regarding the recognition of their parental status. Members debated and adopted, under the consultation procedure, a Legal Affairs (JURI) Committee report on proposed legislation to harmonise jurisdiction, applicable law, recognition of decisions and acceptance of authentic instruments in matters of parenthood. A European Certificate of Parenthood is also proposed. The committee report calls for adding a remedy for a Member State's rejection of parenthood status established in a different Member State. It also calls for guidelines to be developed and to link this piece of legislation to that on digitalisation of cross-border judicial cooperation.\n\nWith both European and United States (US) elections coming up next year, Members took stock of EU-US relations. Members considered and adopted an own-initiative report from Parliament's Committee on Foreign Affairs (AFET), which recommends deepening cooperation on foreign, security and defence policy. As recent US legislation on green and chip manufacturing subsidies, as well as 'Buy American' rules, create a challenging environment for the EU, the AFET report lists a number of policy recommendations aimed at strengthening transatlantic unity in the face of deteriorating global security. The committee also calls for reinforced parliamentary diplomacy and exchange between European Parliament and US Congress committees in charge of foreign affairs.\n\nIn view of the recent 24th EU-China Summit in Beijing, Parliament debated and adopted an AFET own-initiative report on EU-China relations, stressing China's international responsibilities: to uphold sanctions against Russia, to pressure Russia to end its war against Ukraine, and to commit to peak its CO emissions before 2030. Although partnership with China is essential to tackle global challenges like climate change and debt relief, China's actions have led the EU to emphasise its role as competitor and systemic rival. The draft report, scheduled for debate on Tuesday, also calls for UN investigation into human rights violations in China, which Parliament has repeatedly criticised. The committee calls for action to suspend extradition treaties with China and Hong Kong, de-risk trade flows, and combat disinformation originating in China.\n\nParliament gave its consent to the conclusion of the protocol to the EU-Kiribati Fisheries Agreement. Parliament's Committee on Fisheries (PECH) report recommended consent to the protocol, which reactivates an agreement that has been dormant since 2015. It will allow four (usually very large) EU tuna purse seine vessels access to Kiribati fishing grounds, in return for a financial contribution and support for its sectoral fisheries policy. A five-year implementing protocol has applied provisionally since October 2023.\n\nSixteen decisions to enter into interinstitutional negotiations were approved: four from the Economic and Monetary Affairs (ECON) Committee, six from the TRAN committee, two from the LIBE committee, two from the ITRE committee and one from the Internal Market and Consumer Protection (IMCO) and JURI Committees.",

        "title": "Four Seasons Resort Peninsula Papagayo Unveils Virador Beach Club's Culinary Oasis - The Costa Rican Times",
        "body": "In the lush landscapes of Costa Rica's Peninsula Papagayo, the Four Seasons Resort has recently emerged from a significant three-month makeover, ready to dazzle vacation seekers with its latest gem: the Virador Beach Club's Eatery. This new culinary destination, nestled along the breathtaking Papagayo Peninsula, promises an epicurean journey through the vibrant flavors of the Mediterranean and Middle East.\n\nChef Khaled Natour: A Culinary Maestro's Journey\n\nLeading the charge in the kitchen is Chef Khaled Natour, whose journey from the fashion runways to the culinary boulevards is as colorful as the dishes he creates. Born in Israel, Khaled's love for cooking was kindled in his childhood, observing his mother and grandmother weave magic with family recipes. After refining his skills in prestigious eateries like Tel Aviv's Sessa, Khaled brings his \"organic, traditional, and elegantly fun\" approach to the tables of Costa Rica.\n\nA Menu That Speaks Volumes\n\nThe Eatery at Virador Beach Club, designed by renowned architect Jorge Borja, boasts a menu that sings the praises of Khaled's homeland. From the \"very fresh and flavorful\" baba ghanoush and labneh to the sesame-laden Jerusalem bread, the offerings are a testament to freshness and authenticity. For those with a heartier appetite, the Turkish kofta and the Shish Taouk chicken skewers promise a smoky, spice-infused sojourn. The Mezze Platter, a vegetable-centric assortment of dips and salads served with warm Kumaj bread, is perfect for sharing or a light yet fulfilling meal.\n\nCocktails and Cabanas: A Symphony of Flavors\n\nNo culinary experience is complete without a bevy of beverages, and Virador Beach Club doesn't disappoint. Their White Sangria, Spritz, and Mojito Twist are available by the glass or pitcher, perfect for sipping alongside the azure waters. For those seeking a more exclusive experience, bottle service is available in the comfort of the beach club's cabanas.\n\nSustainability Meets Luxury\n\nAdding to the allure of the Four Seasons Resort Peninsula Papagayo is its commitment to sustainability. The Arnold Palmer-designed Ocean Course now features a state-of-the-art irrigation system, significantly reducing water usage. Meanwhile, the newly unveiled Wellness Shala offers a secluded sanctuary for self-care amid the hills, blending luxury with eco-consciousness.\n\nA Destination for Every Desire\n\nWhether you're seeking a culinary adventure, a wellness retreat, or a sustainable golfing experience, the Four Seasons Resort Peninsula Papagayo and its latest addition, Virador Beach Club's Eatery, have raised the bar for luxury resorts.

        "title": "Sometimes Books Don't Work",
        "body": "Compared to most Americans, I read a lot -- more in some fortnights, or even the occasional week, than most Americans read in a year. (Compared to some folks I know, I read very little.)\n\nReading this much gives me a less intimate relationship with any particular book than my sense is that most people, even most readers, have. When people ask me what my favorite book is, I stare blankly -- favorite altogether? Not favorite for what or when or under what conditions? The question just doesn't make sense; how could one have a favorite book any more than one has a favorite glass of water?\n\nAfter all, I read because it's work these days; nothing will kill your love of books or your affectations of a bookish nature faster than being in a doctoral program. In grad school, one learns to gut books like they were fish -- and not artisanally, either: by the time of comprehensive exams, you should be able to extract the thesis from a book like a Russian factory worker debones part of today's catch. (That image is brought to you by the 2014 film Leviathan.) It's hard to speak of love or affection under these circumstances.\n\nStill, sometimes I read more for fun, or at least professional development, than at other times. And that allows for more reflection, or at least for the option of dropping out of a book faster than otherwise.\n\nSo it is with Patricia Crone's Pre-Industrial Societies, which is definitely more in the non-required reading stack, but which I checked out because I thought it might help me build up my foundations of The Politics of the End of the World, a course so multidisciplinary it threatens to break me. In particular, I wanted to better understand what separates us -- you know, post-industrial, wealthy, living lives of undeserved leisure -- from those folks back then, both the grinding peasantry and the gilded elites.\n\nCrone's ambition is to show us, and she means pretty much the people reading this newsletter, how different pre-industrial societies were from ours. This is not a book about any given earlier civilization but, in principle, about the average pre-industrial society. Her thesis is simple: these were societies of extreme wealth inequality, couched in systems of enormous poverty (\"scarcity\", she says), in which organizational capital was particularly scarce, lending particular significance to phenomena like religion and governmental organization (principally the organization of arms), which could transcend the concerns of local agrarian workers and generate a thin layer of complexity atop the relentless drudgery and superstition of local life.\n\nThere's not much in this book for me. Maybe there would have been had I read this a lot earlier in my career; maybe some of the insights into the world of peasant repression and wealth accumulation through conquest would have hit better had I not read similar arguments across dozens of semi-remembered books about the pre-modern world.\n\nBut I doubt it. When one sets oneself an enormous task, one is usually setting oneself up for disappointment. Crone's task is huge: explaining the usual range of variation of human societies from the hunter-gatherer period to the industrial age. Her failure is proportionate.1\n\nOne flaw is that she draws from a ludicrously limited set of examples: many European or familiar to European-descended folks (Rome, Israel and Judea, half-remembered Sumeria and Assyria -- standard British Museum stuff) and a good leavening of Islamic, Chinese, Japanese, sometimes Indian, and occasionally Southeast Asian references. Yet this leaves out a lot. I've long thought that Western Europeans slight the experiences of the \"New World\" and the scant attention to how Aztec, Maya, or other societies might have been different, or even existed, is plain. So, too, are the extremophile civilizations like that of Polynesia or the Himalayas neglected. And there's practically no attention given to nomadic civilizations, most of which would have displayed wildly different tendencies than here.\n\nThe periodization is similarly unclear. Yes, economic growth was quite slow over the period 10,000 BCE to Jane Austen. But it did happen, and simple accumulative wealth also took place. I find it a little hard to believe that Ming China was more or less \"the same\" as that of the Han, for example, not least because it was not just economic but cultural wealth that accumulated -- and the weight of tradition in continuous or semi-continuous cultures seems to displace at least some of the role for myth.\n\nThen, too, this is a work of strikingly conventional history. Disease? Language? Archaeology? Osetology? No room for those here -- we are in a world of scribes and records. Theory? Gender? No thanks, we have assumptions.\n\nShare\n\nPerhaps most damningly, a book about everything is, ultimately, a book about nothing: when early modern Vietnam and ancient China and biblical Israel are dropped in the same paragraph, it's hard to see connective tissues. Had the book been laid out by an anthropologist, I assume there would have been more consistent attention paid to categorizing and taxonomizing early cultures, but alas none such is here -- the book is strictly thematic and achronological.\n\nI don't necessarily mean to turn you off from this book, although to be frank you might be better served by watching some National Geographic and Smithsonian specials (or visiting a top flight museum) than reading this. Rather, I want to share something about how the job of a professional thing-knower happens -- not just through happy and productive engagement with always scintillating texts, but sometimes with disappointing engagements with texts that have shortcomings.\n\nAfter all, Crone's book has some value -- sometimes one needs a citation to discuss how different the earlier eras were from the assumptions underpinning today's. And Brad DeLong hasn't written a better book about life in pre-scarcity societies quite yet. But still I wish this had worked out better.",

        "title": "20 Largest US Embassies In The World",
        "body": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the 20 largest US Embassies in the World. For a quick overview of the largest US Embassies, read our article 5 largest US Embassies in the World.\n\nWith a global presence in 180 countries, the US Department of State oversees 275 diplomatic posts, encompassing a remarkable 3,500 properties, some steeped in rich history and captivating tales. The US government had allocated a budget of $18.5 billion for FY2023 to support US diplomatic missions, security, and the construction and maintenance of US embassies. This represents a 3.1% increase from the $9.35 billion appropriated FY2022. The Biden Administration had $9.64 billion for the Diplomatic Programs account in FY2023. This increase helped to fund critical diplomatic activities, including promoting American business interests abroad, strengthening security at US embassies, building new facilities to meet the needs of a growing diplomatic corps, and boosting educational, cultural, and sports activities.\n\nUS embassies are more than just diplomatic missions; they are powerful engines for American business success. From construction and security to cultural exchange and sustainable initiatives, a diverse range of companies join forces with US embassies across the globe. This collaboration fosters economic development, strengthens international relations, and promotes American values.\n\nOne such business is Jacobs Engineering Group (NYSE:J), a global professional services powerhouse at the forefront of creating a more connected and sustainable world. With over $12 billion in revenue and a team exceeding 50,000 skilled professionals, Jacobs Engineering Group (NYSE:J) offers a comprehensive suite of services encompassing science, technology, engineering, construction, and program management. 2019 Jacobs scored a second consecutive commissioning services contract with the US Department of State Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO), further solidifying their partnership. This five-year contract, worth an estimated $25 million, tasked Jacobs Engineering Group (NYSE:J) with optimizing building systems for OBO's diplomatic missions worldwide. Their expertise in engineering and construction helped OBO understand system requirements, improve performance, and achieve early issue resolution. Additionally, commissioning services facilitated energy efficiency and contributed towards LEED certification, ultimately reducing the total cost of ownership. With this contract, Jacobs Engineering Group (NYSE:J) continued to lead the global professional services sector, providing solutions for a more sustainable and connected world.\n\nAnother notable name in collaboration with US embassies is Fluor Corp (NYSE:FLR). With a current market cap of $6.58 billion, it is a global engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) leader with a proud history of collaboration with the US Department of State on iconic US embassy projects worldwide. Fluor Corp's (NYSE:FLR) expertise in complex, high-security construction aligns perfectly with the demands of diplomacy, ensuring these vital facilities' safety, efficiency, and sustainability. Fluor Corp (NYSE:FLR) was awarded a significant position on the US Department of State's five-year DiPSS (Diplomatic Platform Support Services) program. As one of the large business winners, Fluor Corp (NYSE:FLR) is eligible to compete for projects worth a combined $6 billion, delivering crucial services in challenging and high-threat environments worldwide. With a proven track record supporting government and commercial clients in demanding contingencies, Fluor Corp (NYSE:FLR) stands ready to contribute to the DiPSS program, ensuring the smooth operation of US government installations worldwide.\n\nTo rank the 20 largest US embassies in the world, the physical size of an embassy's building is considered a valuable indicator of its resources, capabilities, and diplomatic significance. A larger embassy compound with more buildings generally suggests a greater allocation of resources, enabling the embassy to accommodate more staff, host larger events, and provide more comprehensive services.\n\nBelow is our list of the 20 largest US embassies in the world in ascending order of the area they covered.\n\nArea Covered (Acres): 0.94\n\nStanding tall in Cairo, Egypt, the US Embassy is a vibrant symbol of American presence and diplomacy in the region. From its iconic location on Tawfik Diab Street to its ongoing engagement with the Egyptian government and people, the embassy plays a vital role in fostering cultural exchange, promoting economic cooperation, and strengthening security ties. Herro Mustafa Garg is an esteemed United States Ambassador to the Arab Republic of Egypt.\n\nArea Covered (Acres): 1.48\n\nNestled within the ancient city of Jerusalem, the US Embassy is a testament to the enduring partnership between the United States and Israel. This modern architectural marvel, perched atop the Arnona neighborhood, serves as a focal point for diplomatic relations, facilitating dialogue, promoting cooperation, and safeguarding security interests. Stephanie L. Hallett, a seasoned diplomat in the Senior Foreign Service, currently holds the position of Deputy Chief of Mission at the US Embassy in Jerusalem. She served as Chargé d'Affaires a.i. from July to November 2023, demonstrating her leadership and diplomatic acumen.\n\nArea Covered (Acres): 3.21\n\nThe US Embassy in Seoul, South Korea, represents America's diplomatic interests and fosters US-South Korean relations. Located in the heart of Seoul, it serves as a vital link between the two nations, facilitating communication, cooperation, and trade. The embassy provides various services to American citizens and Korean nationals, from visas to cultural exchange programs. The US and South Korea share a massive trade relationship, totaling $1.6 trillion annually. South Korea's favorable tax system, proximity to the US, and shared democratic values make it an ideal investment destination for American businesses.\n\nArea Covered (Acres): 3.21\n\nCompleted in August 1976 and officially opened on September 6th of the same year, the current US Embassy building in Tokyo is a testament to American-Japanese relations. Designed by renowned architects César Pelli and Norma Merrick Sklarek of Gruen Associates, the building boasts spacious rooms and serene gardens, offering an oasis amidst the bustling downtown. Constructed by the esteemed Obayashi Corporation, the project encompassed a 45,000-square-foot embassy building and a three-story wing, completed under the auspices of the US Department of State's Office of Foreign Buildings Operations.\n\nArea Covered (Acres): 4.5\n\nLocated on Pariser Platz, directly across from the iconic Brandenburg Gate, the 200,000-square-foot US embassy in Berlin boasts a limestone facade that seamlessly blends with the surrounding historic architecture. The four-and-a-quarter-story structure, rising above the intersection of Behrenstrasse and Ebertstrasse, was meticulously designed with aesthetics and security in mind. Thornton Tomasetti, a renowned engineering firm, provided structural design and blast engineering services to ensure the embassy's resilience and functionality.\n\nArea Covered (Acres): 5.9\n\nEnvisioned in 1934, shortly after the US recognized the Soviet Union, the US Embassy in Moscow initially aimed for a prominent location on Lenin Hills overlooking the Moscow River. While that vision didn't materialize, the current embassy compound in the Presnensky District across from the White House and near the Moscow Zoo is a testament to the enduring diplomatic relationship between the United States and Russia.\n\nArea Covered (Acres): 7.57\n\nUS trade with the Dutch colony of Indonesia established a consular post in Jakarta in 1801. 1958, the current US embassy compound opened, a masterpiece designed by Czech architects Antonin Raymond and Ladislav Rado.\n\nArea Covered (Acres): 8.5\n\nRecognizing Mexico's independence in 1822, the United States dispatched its first envoy in 1825. However, Texan annexation in 1846 led to war, reestablishing formal ties only in 1917. The current US embassy in Mexico City, built in 1961, is the central hub for diplomatic relations. Additionally, the United States maintains consulates general in key cities across Mexico, including Ciudad Juarez, Guadalajara, and Tijuana.\n\nArea Covered (Acres): 9\n\nSituated on a sprawling nine-acre campus in Ankara's burgeoning Söğütözü business district, the new US Embassy represents not just a physical structure but a commitment to strengthening US-Turkish relations across diplomatic, security, and commercial spheres. Embodying the Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) mission to provide robust platforms for American diplomacy abroad, the embassy boasts a design that seamlessly blends functionality with aesthetics. Drawing inspiration from traditional Turkish courtyards, the building seamlessly integrates architectural and landscape elements, creating a light-filled space fostering collaboration and community through its internal courtyards.\n\nArea Covered (Acres): 10\n\nNestled on a four-hectare site in Beijing, the US Embassy complex houses over 20 agencies and 700 employees within its eight buildings, including a consular services building, marine barracks, and perimeter inspection stations. The complex's crown jewel is an eight-story glass box, its shimmering facade shifting between transparency, translucence, and opacity. Illuminated at night, the office building evokes the image of a traditional paper lantern, symbolizing the embassy's design philosophy - a harmonious blend of Eastern and Western influences.\n\nArea Covered (Acres): 11.8\n\nForging diplomatic ties in 1785, the United States and the United Kingdom have maintained a long and complex relationship. Though severed briefly during the War of 1812, relations were quickly restored, culminating in the Legation's elevation to an embassy in 1893. Grosvenor Square became the embassy's home in 1938, witnessing the pivotal role of the UK during World War II, as the Chancery stood side-by-side with General Eisenhower's headquarters. In 2018, the US-UK partnership secured a new physical embodiment with the opening of the current embassy, solidifying the enduring bond between these two close allies.\n\nArea Covered (Acres): 12\n\nRising on the historic grounds of its predecessor in Brasília's Embassy Sector, the new US Embassy promises to be more than just bricks and mortar; it will be a secure, innovative, and sustainable platform for diplomacy, fostering the continued growth of the US-Brazil bilateral relationship. The project embraces environmental responsibility, already achieving PROCEL certification for energy efficiency and aiming for LEED® Silver status. Beyond its ecological credentials, the construction phase is projected to create a significant economic impact, injecting $185 million into the local economy and equipping 1,245 individuals with valuable job training and educational opportunities.\n\nArea Covered (Acres): 22\n\nFollowing Armenia's independence from the Soviet Union in 1992, the United States established diplomatic relations, forging a partnership focused on mutual progress. The two nations collaborate across various sectors, from reducing poverty to expanding trade and investment. Promoting civil society groups and broadening access to healthcare are key pillars of this partnership. Committed to strengthening Armenia's democracy and open market economy, the United States also supports a peaceful resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, encouraging the reopening of closed borders and fostering regional stability for a prosperous future.\n\nArea Covered (Acres): 26\n\nNestled within Riyadh's Diplomatic Quarter, the US Embassy stands strategically across from the bustling Al-Kindi Plaza, a vibrant shopping and business hub. Situated between Circles 8 and 9, the Embassy fosters a sense of accessibility while adhering to stringent security measures, with restricted direct access by car. This carefully chosen location reflects the Embassy's commitment to engagement and vigilance, symbolizing the enduring partnership between the United States and Saudi Arabia.\n\nArea Covered (Acres): 28\n\nA testament to the profound relationship between the world's oldest and largest democracies, the United States Embassy in New Delhi is one of the most active and sprawling diplomatic missions globally. It serves over a thousand consular visitors daily, facilitating economic and cultural exchanges between American and foreign citizens. Since its inception in 1959, the embassy has witnessed remarkable growth, necessitating a reimagining of the historic site and its role in advancing American diplomacy. In response, the US Department of State Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) entrusted Weiss/Manfredi of New York with developing a master plan for the embassy. This plan aims to create new facilities that honor the site's legacy while laying the groundwork for a future of flourishing Indian-US diplomacy.",

        "title": "Now Open: Virador Beach Club's Eatery At Four Seasons Resort Peninsula Papagayo, Costa Rica",
        "body": "Though it's fresh off a significant three-month refresh, the recently reopened Four Seasons Resort Peninsula Papagayo, Costa Rica continues to roll out even more reasons to book a vacation. The world-famous Arnold Palmer-designed Ocean Course at Peninsula Papagayo is now outfitted with a state-of-the-art irrigation system for a dramatic drop in water usage, while the just-unveiled Wellness Shala provides a secluded sanctuary for self-care high in the hills. But it's the Eatery and Beachside Club at Virador Beach Club, which opens today, that's poised to garner the most buzz for the iconic resort located along Costa Rica's staggeringly beautiful Papagayo Peninsula.\n\nUnder the leadership of chef Khaled Natour, the bohemian-inspired open-air restaurant and lounge designed by famed architect Jorge Borja spotlights the vibrant and culture-melding flavors of the Mediterranean and Middle East. Born and raised in Israel, Khaled's passion for cooking sparked as a young boy while watching his mother and grandmother prepare family recipes passed on for generations. And though he started working professionally in the world of fashion, it didn't take long for him to return to his first love: food.\n\nAfter working in Haifa for several years and training in prestigious restaurants like Tel Aviv's Sessa -- where Khaled honed his kitchen approach, which he describes as \"organic, traditional, and elegant but fun\" -- he decamped to Costa Rica late last year. His goal at Virador Beach Club is simple and from the heart: \"to show Costa Rica and Four Seasons guests the authentic flavors of my homeland.\"\n\nFor a light bite or lunch, Khaled recommends the \"very fresh and flavorful\" baba ghanoush and labneh. (Make sure to order some of heavenly sesame-studded Jerusalem breads for scooping.) Craving something heartier? Order the Turkish kofta (ground meat patties), which the chef says is \"full of smokiness from the grill and fresh flavor from cumin and cardamon.\" He's also a fan of the Shish Taouk, \"a chicken skewer dish with amazing depth.\" Whether you're a carnivore or plant-based eater, though, the Mezze Platter is a must. The vegetable-centric bountiful spread of assorted dips and salads accompanied by warm, fresh-baked Kumaj bread is equally terrific as a shareable appetizer as it is for a satisfying meal that won't weigh you down. And to round out the culinary experience at Virador Beach Club, there's refreshing cocktails such as the White Sangria, Spritz, and Mojito Twist available by the glass or pitcher, along with bottle service.",

        "title": "20 Largest US Embassies In The World",
        "body": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the 20 largest US Embassies in the World. For a quick overview of the largest US Embassies, read our article 5 largest US Embassies in the World.\n\nWith a global presence in 180 countries, the US Department of State oversees 275 diplomatic posts, encompassing a remarkable 3,500 properties, some steeped in rich history and captivating tales. The US government had allocated a budget of $18.5 billion for FY2023 to support US diplomatic missions, security, and the construction and maintenance of US embassies. This represents a 3.1% increase from the $9.35 billion appropriated FY2022. The Biden Administration had $9.64 billion for the Diplomatic Programs account in FY2023. This increase helped to fund critical diplomatic activities, including promoting American business interests abroad, strengthening security at US embassies, building new facilities to meet the needs of a growing diplomatic corps, and boosting educational, cultural, and sports activities.\n\nUS embassies are more than just diplomatic missions; they are powerful engines for American business success. From construction and security to cultural exchange and sustainable initiatives, a diverse range of companies join forces with US embassies across the globe. This collaboration fosters economic development, strengthens international relations, and promotes American values.\n\nOne such business is Jacobs Engineering Group (NYSE:J), a global professional services powerhouse at the forefront of creating a more connected and sustainable world. With over $12 billion in revenue and a team exceeding 50,000 skilled professionals, Jacobs Engineering Group (NYSE:J) offers a comprehensive suite of services encompassing science, technology, engineering, construction, and program management. 2019 Jacobs scored a second consecutive commissioning services contract with the US Department of State Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO), further solidifying their partnership. This five-year contract, worth an estimated $25 million, tasked Jacobs Engineering Group (NYSE:J) with optimizing building systems for OBO's diplomatic missions worldwide. Their expertise in engineering and construction helped OBO understand system requirements, improve performance, and achieve early issue resolution. Additionally, commissioning services facilitated energy efficiency and contributed towards LEED certification, ultimately reducing the total cost of ownership. With this contract, Jacobs Engineering Group (NYSE:J) continued to lead the global professional services sector, providing solutions for a more sustainable and connected world.\n\nAnother notable name in collaboration with US embassies is Fluor Corp (NYSE:FLR). With a current market cap of $6.58 billion, it is a global engineering, procurement, and construction (EPC) leader with a proud history of collaboration with the US Department of State on iconic US embassy projects worldwide. Fluor Corp's (NYSE:FLR) expertise in complex, high-security construction aligns perfectly with the demands of diplomacy, ensuring these vital facilities' safety, efficiency, and sustainability. Fluor Corp (NYSE:FLR) was awarded a significant position on the US Department of State's five-year DiPSS (Diplomatic Platform Support Services) program. As one of the large business winners, Fluor Corp (NYSE:FLR) is eligible to compete for projects worth a combined $6 billion, delivering crucial services in challenging and high-threat environments worldwide. With a proven track record supporting government and commercial clients in demanding contingencies, Fluor Corp (NYSE:FLR) stands ready to contribute to the DiPSS program, ensuring the smooth operation of US government installations worldwide.\n\nTo rank the 20 largest US embassies in the world, the physical size of an embassy's building is considered a valuable indicator of its resources, capabilities, and diplomatic significance. A larger embassy compound with more buildings generally suggests a greater allocation of resources, enabling the embassy to accommodate more staff, host larger events, and provide more comprehensive services.\n\nBelow is our list of the 20 largest US embassies in the world in ascending order of the area they covered.\n\nArea Covered (Acres): 0.94\n\nStanding tall in Cairo, Egypt, the US Embassy is a vibrant symbol of American presence and diplomacy in the region. From its iconic location on Tawfik Diab Street to its ongoing engagement with the Egyptian government and people, the embassy plays a vital role in fostering cultural exchange, promoting economic cooperation, and strengthening security ties. Herro Mustafa Garg is an esteemed United States Ambassador to the Arab Republic of Egypt.\n\nArea Covered (Acres): 1.48\n\nNestled within the ancient city of Jerusalem, the US Embassy is a testament to the enduring partnership between the United States and Israel. This modern architectural marvel, perched atop the Arnona neighborhood, serves as a focal point for diplomatic relations, facilitating dialogue, promoting cooperation, and safeguarding security interests. Stephanie L. Hallett, a seasoned diplomat in the Senior Foreign Service, currently holds the position of Deputy Chief of Mission at the US Embassy in Jerusalem. She served as Chargé d'Affaires a.i. from July to November 2023, demonstrating her leadership and diplomatic acumen.\n\nArea Covered (Acres): 3.21\n\nThe US Embassy in Seoul, South Korea, represents America's diplomatic interests and fosters US-South Korean relations. Located in the heart of Seoul, it serves as a vital link between the two nations, facilitating communication, cooperation, and trade. The embassy provides various services to American citizens and Korean nationals, from visas to cultural exchange programs. The US and South Korea share a massive trade relationship, totaling $1.6 trillion annually. South Korea's favorable tax system, proximity to the US, and shared democratic values make it an ideal investment destination for American businesses.\n\nArea Covered (Acres): 3.21\n\nCompleted in August 1976 and officially opened on September 6th of the same year, the current US Embassy building in Tokyo is a testament to American-Japanese relations. Designed by renowned architects César Pelli and Norma Merrick Sklarek of Gruen Associates, the building boasts spacious rooms and serene gardens, offering an oasis amidst the bustling downtown. Constructed by the esteemed Obayashi Corporation, the project encompassed a 45,000-square-foot embassy building and a three-story wing, completed under the auspices of the US Department of State's Office of Foreign Buildings Operations.\n\nArea Covered (Acres): 4.5\n\nLocated on Pariser Platz, directly across from the iconic Brandenburg Gate, the 200,000-square-foot US embassy in Berlin boasts a limestone facade that seamlessly blends with the surrounding historic architecture. The four-and-a-quarter-story structure, rising above the intersection of Behrenstrasse and Ebertstrasse, was meticulously designed with aesthetics and security in mind. Thornton Tomasetti, a renowned engineering firm, provided structural design and blast engineering services to ensure the embassy's resilience and functionality.\n\nArea Covered (Acres): 5.9\n\nEnvisioned in 1934, shortly after the US recognized the Soviet Union, the US Embassy in Moscow initially aimed for a prominent location on Lenin Hills overlooking the Moscow River. While that vision didn't materialize, the current embassy compound in the Presnensky District across from the White House and near the Moscow Zoo is a testament to the enduring diplomatic relationship between the United States and Russia.\n\nArea Covered (Acres): 7.57\n\nUS trade with the Dutch colony of Indonesia established a consular post in Jakarta in 1801. 1958, the current US embassy compound opened, a masterpiece designed by Czech architects Antonin Raymond and Ladislav Rado.\n\nArea Covered (Acres): 8.5\n\nRecognizing Mexico's independence in 1822, the United States dispatched its first envoy in 1825. However, Texan annexation in 1846 led to war, reestablishing formal ties only in 1917. The current US embassy in Mexico City, built in 1961, is the central hub for diplomatic relations. Additionally, the United States maintains consulates general in key cities across Mexico, including Ciudad Juarez, Guadalajara, and Tijuana.\n\nArea Covered (Acres): 9\n\nSituated on a sprawling nine-acre campus in Ankara's burgeoning Söğütözü business district, the new US Embassy represents not just a physical structure but a commitment to strengthening US-Turkish relations across diplomatic, security, and commercial spheres. Embodying the Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) mission to provide robust platforms for American diplomacy abroad, the embassy boasts a design that seamlessly blends functionality with aesthetics. Drawing inspiration from traditional Turkish courtyards, the building seamlessly integrates architectural and landscape elements, creating a light-filled space fostering collaboration and community through its internal courtyards.\n\nArea Covered (Acres): 10\n\nNestled on a four-hectare site in Beijing, the US Embassy complex houses over 20 agencies and 700 employees within its eight buildings, including a consular services building, marine barracks, and perimeter inspection stations. The complex's crown jewel is an eight-story glass box, its shimmering facade shifting between transparency, translucence, and opacity. Illuminated at night, the office building evokes the image of a traditional paper lantern, symbolizing the embassy's design philosophy - a harmonious blend of Eastern and Western influences.\n\nArea Covered (Acres): 11.8\n\nForging diplomatic ties in 1785, the United States and the United Kingdom have maintained a long and complex relationship. Though severed briefly during the War of 1812, relations were quickly restored, culminating in the Legation's elevation to an embassy in 1893. Grosvenor Square became the embassy's home in 1938, witnessing the pivotal role of the UK during World War II, as the Chancery stood side-by-side with General Eisenhower's headquarters. In 2018, the US-UK partnership secured a new physical embodiment with the opening of the current embassy, solidifying the enduring bond between these two close allies.\n\nArea Covered (Acres): 12\n\nRising on the historic grounds of its predecessor in Brasília's Embassy Sector, the new US Embassy promises to be more than just bricks and mortar; it will be a secure, innovative, and sustainable platform for diplomacy, fostering the continued growth of the US-Brazil bilateral relationship. The project embraces environmental responsibility, already achieving PROCEL certification for energy efficiency and aiming for LEED® Silver status. Beyond its ecological credentials, the construction phase is projected to create a significant economic impact, injecting $185 million into the local economy and equipping 1,245 individuals with valuable job training and educational opportunities.\n\nArea Covered (Acres): 22\n\nFollowing Armenia's independence from the Soviet Union in 1992, the United States established diplomatic relations, forging a partnership focused on mutual progress. The two nations collaborate across various sectors, from reducing poverty to expanding trade and investment. Promoting civil society groups and broadening access to healthcare are key pillars of this partnership. Committed to strengthening Armenia's democracy and open market economy, the United States also supports a peaceful resolution of the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict, encouraging the reopening of closed borders and fostering regional stability for a prosperous future.\n\nArea Covered (Acres): 26\n\nNestled within Riyadh's Diplomatic Quarter, the US Embassy stands strategically across from the bustling Al-Kindi Plaza, a vibrant shopping and business hub. Situated between Circles 8 and 9, the Embassy fosters a sense of accessibility while adhering to stringent security measures, with restricted direct access by car. This carefully chosen location reflects the Embassy's commitment to engagement and vigilance, symbolizing the enduring partnership between the United States and Saudi Arabia.\n\nArea Covered (Acres): 28\n\nA testament to the profound relationship between the world's oldest and largest democracies, the United States Embassy in New Delhi is one of the most active and sprawling diplomatic missions globally. It serves over a thousand consular visitors daily, facilitating economic and cultural exchanges between American and foreign citizens. Since its inception in 1959, the embassy has witnessed remarkable growth, necessitating a reimagining of the historic site and its role in advancing American diplomacy. In response, the US Department of State Bureau of Overseas Buildings Operations (OBO) entrusted Weiss/Manfredi of New York with developing a master plan for the embassy. This plan aims to create new facilities that honor the site's legacy while laying the groundwork for a future of flourishing Indian-US diplomacy.",

(âSky Growthâ), to invest in advanced laser- based wireless charging technology systems, for the remote charging of drones and unmanned aircrafts (the âInvestmentâ).\n\nThe LOI follows the Companyâs announcement from November 29, 2023, in which the board of directors resolved to identify potential strategic transactions, in the field of advanced technologies, with the goal of maximizing shareholder value.\n\nAccording to the LOI, Sky Growth will establish and transfer all of its rights in the technology to a new Israeli company that will develop, manufacture and market the technology (\"NewCo\"). Following an investment of $2.5 million by Jeffsâ Brands, it will hold a 70% equity interest in NewCo. The LOI also includes certain milestone conditions that if achieved by NewCo, will grant the founders, for no additional consideration, additional equity interests in NewCo.\n\nNewCo plans on developing a technological system based on a pending patent.

        "title": "Biden envoy to meet with Abbas as the US floats a possible Palestinian security role in postwar Gaza",
        "body": "RAMALLAH, -- The United States national security adviser and the Palestinian president were set Friday to discuss postwar arrangements for Gaza -- which, according to a senior U.S. official, could include reactivating Palestinian security forces driven out by Hamas in its 2007 takeover of the territory.\n\nThe proposal, floated as one of several, was the first specific indicator of Washington's vision for security arrangements in Gaza if Israel achieves its U.S.-backed objective to end Hamas control of the besieged enclave.\n\nAny role for Palestinian security forces in Gaza is bound to elicit strong opposition from Israel, which seeks to maintain an open-ended security presence there and says it won't allow a postwar foothold for the internationally backed Palestinian Authority, a West Bank-based autonomy government led by President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nOn Thursday, Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, spoke to Israeli leaders about a timetable for winding down the intense combat phase of the war.\n\nThe offensive, triggered by the unprecedented Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, has flattened much of northern Gaza and driven 80% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million from their homes. Displaced people have squeezed into shelters mainly in the south in a spiraling humanitarian crisis.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden's administration has shown unease over Israel's failure to reduce civilian casualties and its plans for the future of Gaza, but the White House continues to offer wholehearted support for Israel with weapons shipments and diplomatic backing.\n\n\"I want them to be focused on how to save civilian lives,\" Biden said Thursday when asked if he wants Israel to scale down its operations by the end of the month. \"Not stop going after Hamas, but be more careful.\"\n\nWhite House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Sullivan talked with Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu about moving to \"lower intensity operations\" sometime \"in the near future.\"\n\nIt was not clear to what extent the U.S. and Israel differ on the timetable. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told Sullivan that it would take months to destroy Hamas, but did not say in his statement whether his estimate referred to the current phase of heavy combat.\n\nGallant has said this phase would be followed by lower-intensity campaign to stamp out any pockets of Hamas resistance.\n\nA deadly Hamas ambush on Israeli troops in Gaza City this week showed the group's resilience and called into question whether Israel can defeat it without wiping out the entire territory.\n\nIsrael's air and ground assault over the past 10 weeks has killed more than 18,700 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. Thousands more are missing and feared dead beneath the rubble.\n\nThe ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths. Its latest count did not specify how many were women and minors, but they have consistently made up around two-thirds of the dead in previous tallies.\n\nOn Friday morning, communications services still appeared to be down across Gaza. The Palestinian telecommunications provider Paltel had announced Thursday evening that services were cut off due to ongoing fighting.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes and tank shelling continued overnight and into Friday, including in the southern city of Rafah, part of the shrinking areas of tiny, densely populated Gaza to which Palestinian civilians had been told by Israel to evacuate. At least one person was killed, according to an Associated Press journalist who saw the body arriving at a local hospital.\n\nIsraelis remain strongly supportive of the war and see it as necessary to prevent a repeat of Oct. 7, when Palestinian militants attacked communities across southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 240 hostage. A total of 116 soldiers have been killed in the ground offensive, which began Oct. 27.\n\nThe Israeli military on Friday confirmed the return of the bodies of three hostages. Two were soldiers, both aged 19, and the third was a 28-year-old dual French-Israeli national kidnapped from a music festival.\n\nMore than 100 hostages have been freed, most during a cease-fire last month in exchange for the release of 240 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.\n\nPalestinian support for Hamas has tripled in the West Bank, with a small uptick in Gaza, according to a poll published Wednesday. Still, a majority of Palestinians do not back Hamas, according to the survey, which had an error margin of 4 percentage points.\n\nSullivan was scheduled to meet Friday with Abbas, who lost control of Gaza when Hamas drove out his security forces in 2007. The takeover came a year after Hamas defeated Abbas' Fatah party in parliament elections and the rivals failed to form a unity government.\n\nA senior U.S. official said that Sullivan and others have discussed the prospect of having those associated with the Palestinian Authority security forces before the Hamas takeover serve as the \"nucleus\" of postwar peacekeeping in Gaza.\n\nIt was one idea of many being considered for establishing security in Gaza, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with White House ground rules. He said such talks were taking place with Israel, the Palestinian Authority and regional partners.\n\nThe U.S. has said it eventually wants to see the West Bank and Gaza under a unified Palestinian government, as a precursor to Palestinian statehood -- an idea soundly rejected by Netanyahu, who leads a right-wing government that is opposed to Palestinian statehood.\n\nThe Palestinian prime minister told The Associated Press it's time for the United States to deal more firmly with Israel, particularly on Washington's calls for postwar negotiations for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\n\"Now that the United States has talked the talk, we want Washington to walk the walk,\" Mohammed Shtayyeh said Thursday. \"If the United States cannot deliver Israel, who can?\"\n\nAs part of postwar scenarios, Washington has also called for revitalizing the Palestinian Authority, without letting on whether such reforms would require personnel changes or general elections, which last took place 17 years ago. The 88-year-old Abbas is widely unpopular, with this week's poll indicating close to 90% of Palestinians want him to resign.\n\n___\n\nJobain reported from Rafah, Gaza Strip, and Mroue from Beirut.

        "title": "Biden envoy to meet with Abbas as the US floats a possible Palestinian security role in postwar Gaza",
        "body": "RAMALLAH, -- The United States national security adviser and the Palestinian president were set Friday to discuss postwar arrangements for Gaza -- which, according to a senior U.S. official, could include reactivating Palestinian security forces driven out by Hamas in its 2007 takeover of the territory.\n\nThe proposal, floated as one of several, was the first specific indicator of Washington's vision for security arrangements in Gaza if Israel achieves its U.S.-backed objective to end Hamas control of the besieged enclave.\n\nAny role for Palestinian security forces in Gaza is bound to elicit strong opposition from Israel, which seeks to maintain an open-ended security presence there and says it won't allow a postwar foothold for the internationally backed Palestinian Authority, a West Bank-based autonomy government led by President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nOn Thursday, Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, spoke to Israeli leaders about a timetable for winding down the intense combat phase of the war.\n\nThe offensive, triggered by the unprecedented Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, has flattened much of northern Gaza and driven 80% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million from their homes. Displaced people have squeezed into shelters mainly in the south in a spiraling humanitarian crisis.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden's administration has shown unease over Israel's failure to reduce civilian casualties and its plans for the future of Gaza, but the White House continues to offer wholehearted support for Israel with weapons shipments and diplomatic backing.\n\n\"I want them to be focused on how to save civilian lives,\" Biden said Thursday when asked if he wants Israel to scale down its operations by the end of the month. \"Not stop going after Hamas, but be more careful.\"\n\nWhite House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Sullivan talked with Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu about moving to \"lower intensity operations\" sometime \"in the near future.\"\n\nIt was not clear to what extent the U.S. and Israel differ on the timetable. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told Sullivan that it would take months to destroy Hamas, but did not say in his statement whether his estimate referred to the current phase of heavy combat.\n\nGallant has said this phase would be followed by lower-intensity campaign to stamp out any pockets of Hamas resistance.\n\nA deadly Hamas ambush on Israeli troops in Gaza City this week showed the group's resilience and called into question whether Israel can defeat it without wiping out the entire territory.\n\nIsrael's air and ground assault over the past 10 weeks has killed more than 18,700 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. Thousands more are missing and feared dead beneath the rubble.\n\nThe ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths. Its latest count did not specify how many were women and minors, but they have consistently made up around two-thirds of the dead in previous tallies.\n\nOn Friday morning, communications services still appeared to be down across Gaza. The Palestinian telecommunications provider Paltel had announced Thursday evening that services were cut off due to ongoing fighting.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes and tank shelling continued overnight and into Friday, including in the southern city of Rafah, part of the shrinking areas of tiny, densely populated Gaza to which Palestinian civilians had been told by Israel to evacuate. At least one person was killed, according to an Associated Press journalist who saw the body arriving at a local hospital.\n\nIsraelis remain strongly supportive of the war and see it as necessary to prevent a repeat of Oct. 7, when Palestinian militants attacked communities across southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 240 hostage. A total of 116 soldiers have been killed in the ground offensive, which began Oct. 27.\n\nThe Israeli military on Friday confirmed the return of the bodies of three hostages. Two were soldiers, both aged 19, and the third was a 28-year-old dual French-Israeli national kidnapped from a music festival.\n\nMore than 100 hostages have been freed, most during a cease-fire last month in exchange for the release of 240 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.\n\nPalestinian support for Hamas has tripled in the West Bank, with a small uptick in Gaza, according to a poll published Wednesday. Still, a majority of Palestinians do not back Hamas, according to the survey, which had an error margin of 4 percentage points.\n\nSullivan was scheduled to meet Friday with Abbas, who lost control of Gaza when Hamas drove out his security forces in 2007. The takeover came a year after Hamas defeated Abbas' Fatah party in parliament elections and the rivals failed to form a unity government.\n\nA senior U.S. official said that Sullivan and others have discussed the prospect of having those associated with the Palestinian Authority security forces before the Hamas takeover serve as the \"nucleus\" of postwar peacekeeping in Gaza.\n\nIt was one idea of many being considered for establishing security in Gaza, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with White House ground rules. He said such talks were taking place with Israel, the Palestinian Authority and regional partners.\n\nThe U.S. has said it eventually wants to see the West Bank and Gaza under a unified Palestinian government, as a precursor to Palestinian statehood -- an idea soundly rejected by Netanyahu, who leads a right-wing government that is opposed to Palestinian statehood.\n\nThe Palestinian prime minister told The Associated Press it's time for the United States to deal more firmly with Israel, particularly on Washington's calls for postwar negotiations for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\n\"Now that the United States has talked the talk, we want Washington to walk the walk,\" Mohammed Shtayyeh said Thursday. \"If the United States cannot deliver Israel, who can?\"\n\nAs part of postwar scenarios, Washington has also called for revitalizing the Palestinian Authority, without letting on whether such reforms would require personnel changes or general elections, which last took place 17 years ago. The 88-year-old Abbas is widely unpopular, with this week's poll indicating close to 90% of Palestinians want him to resign.\n\n___\n\nJobain reported from Rafah, Gaza Strip, and Mroue from Beirut.

        "body": "WASHINGTON | CONGRESS\n\nWASHINGTON -- The House passed a defense policy bill Thursday that authorizes the biggest pay raise for troops in more than two decades, overcoming objections from some conservatives concerned the measure did not do enough to restrict the Pentagon's diversity initiatives, abortion travel policy and gender-affirming health care for transgender service members.\n\nThe $886 billion defense bill was approved by a vote of 310118 and now goes to President Joe Biden after the Senate overwhelmingly passed it Wednesday. It is likely the last piece of major legislation Congress will consider before leaving for the holiday break.\n\nLawmakers departed Washington on Thursday without a deal to pass wartime support for Ukraine, even as Biden's administration raced to negotiate with Senate Republicans who demand changes to U.S. border security policy in return.\n\nPeople are also reading...

But the House showed no sign of returning to push the legislation through the full Congress.\n\nThursday's spending bill represents about a 3% increase from the prior year. The bill serves as a blueprint for programs Congress will seek to fund through follow-up spending bills.\n\nLawmakers have been negotiating a final defense policy bill for months after each chamber passed strikingly different versions in July. Some of the priorities championed by social conservatives were a no-go for Democrats. Negotiators dropped them from the final version to get it over the finish line.\n\nThat did not go over well with some Republican lawmakers, though most voted for a bill that traditionally has broad, bipartisan support.\n\nMost notably, the bill does not include language sought by House Republicans to restrict gender affirming health care for transgender service members and it does not block the Pentagon's abortion travel policy, which allows reimbursement for travel expenses when a service member has to go out of state for an abortion or other reproductive care.\n\nRepublicans did win some concessions on diversity and inclusion training in the military. For example, the bill freezes hiring for such training until a full accounting of the programming and costs is completed and reported to Congress.\n\nTags Politics Legislation Trade Job Market Armed Forces Law Revenue Services Sociology Sports Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.",

        "body": "RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- The United States national security adviser and the Palestinian president were set Friday to discuss postwar arrangements for Gaza -- which, according to a senior U.S. official, could include reactivating Palestinian security forces driven out by Hamas in its 2007 takeover of the territory.\n\nThe proposal, floated as one of several, was the first specific indicator of Washington's vision for security arrangements in Gaza if Israel achieves its U.S.-backed objective to end Hamas control of the besieged enclave.\n\nAny role for Palestinian security forces in Gaza is bound to elicit strong opposition from Israel, which seeks to maintain an open-ended security presence there and says it won't allow a postwar foothold for the internationally backed Palestinian Authority, a West Bank-based autonomy government led by President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nOn Thursday, Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, spoke to Israeli leaders about a timetable for winding down the intense combat phase of the war.\n\nThe offensive, triggered by the unprecedented Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, has flattened much of northern Gaza and driven 80% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million from their homes. Displaced people have squeezed into shelters mainly in the south in a spiraling humanitarian crisis.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden's administration has shown unease over Israel's failure to reduce civilian casualties and its plans for the future of Gaza, but the White House continues to offer wholehearted support for Israel with weapons shipments and diplomatic backing.\n\n\"I want them to be focused on how to save civilian lives,\" Biden said Thursday when asked if he wants Israel to scale down its operations by the end of the month. \"Not stop going after Hamas, but be more careful.\"\n\nWhite House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Sullivan talked with Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu about moving to \"lower intensity operations\" sometime \"in the near future.\"\n\nIt was not clear to what extent the U.S. and Israel differ on the timetable. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told Sullivan that it would take months to destroy Hamas, but did not say in his statement whether his estimate referred to the current phase of heavy combat.\n\nGallant has said this phase would be followed by lower-intensity campaign to stamp out any pockets of Hamas resistance.\n\nA deadly Hamas ambush on Israeli troops in Gaza City this week showed the group's resilience and called into question whether Israel can defeat it without wiping out the entire territory.\n\nIsrael's air and ground assault over the past 10 weeks has killed more than 18,700 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. Thousands more are missing and feared dead beneath the rubble.\n\nThe ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths. Its latest count did not specify how many were women and minors, but they have consistently made up around two-thirds of the dead in previous tallies.\n\nOn Friday morning, communications services still appeared to be down across Gaza. The Palestinian telecommunications provider Paltel had announced Thursday evening that services were cut off due to ongoing fighting.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes and tank shelling continued overnight and into Friday, including in the southern city of Rafah, part of the shrinking areas of tiny, densely populated Gaza to which Palestinian civilians had been told by Israel to evacuate. At least one person was killed, according to an Associated Press journalist who saw the body arriving at a local hospital.\n\nIsraelis remain strongly supportive of the war and see it as necessary to prevent a repeat of Oct. 7, when Palestinian militants attacked communities across southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 240 hostage. A total of 116 soldiers have been killed in the ground offensive, which began Oct. 27.\n\nThe Israeli military on Friday confirmed the return of the bodies of three hostages. Two were soldiers, both aged 19, and the third was a 28-year-old dual French-Israeli national kidnapped from a music festival.\n\nMore than 100 hostages have been freed, most during a cease-fire last month in exchange for the release of 240 Palestinian prisoners held by Israel.\n\nPalestinian support for Hamas has tripled in the West Bank, with a small uptick in Gaza, according to a poll published Wednesday. Still, a majority of Palestinians do not back Hamas, according to the survey, which had an error margin of 4 percentage points.\n\nSullivan was scheduled to meet Friday with Abbas, who lost control of Gaza when Hamas drove out his security forces in 2007. The takeover came a year after Hamas defeated Abbas' Fatah party in parliament elections and the rivals failed to form a unity government.\n\nA senior U.S. official said that Sullivan and others have discussed the prospect of having those associated with the Palestinian Authority security forces before the Hamas takeover serve as the \"nucleus\" of postwar peacekeeping in Gaza.\n\nIt was one idea of many being considered for establishing security in Gaza, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with White House ground rules. He said such talks were taking place with Israel, the Palestinian Authority and regional partners.\n\nThe U.S. has said it eventually wants to see the West Bank and Gaza under a unified Palestinian government, as a precursor to Palestinian statehood -- an idea soundly rejected by Netanyahu, who leads a right-wing government that is opposed to Palestinian statehood.\n\nThe Palestinian prime minister told The Associated Press it's time for the United States to deal more firmly with Israel, particularly on Washington's calls for postwar negotiations for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\n\"Now that the United States has talked the talk, we want Washington to walk the walk,\" Mohammed Shtayyeh said Thursday. \"If the United States cannot deliver Israel, who can?\"\n\nAs part of postwar scenarios, Washington has also called for revitalizing the Palestinian Authority, without letting on whether such reforms would require personnel changes or general elections, which last took place 17 years ago. The 88-year-old Abbas is widely unpopular, with this week's poll indicating close to 90% of Palestinians want him to resign.\n\nJobain reported from Rafah, Gaza Strip, and Mroue from Beirut.

        "title": "Biden goes back to basics on healthcare as Trump outpolls him on economy",
        "body": "President Joe Biden and his allies are getting back to their roots by highlighting healthcare, an issue that the public has historically associated more closely with Democrats.\n\nBut as former President Donald Trump outperforms Biden on some of voters' top priorities, from the economy to national security, Biden is being encouraged to promote his record on healthcare before next year's election.\n\nBIDEN'S OFF-RAMP SHOULD HE BOW OUT OF THE 2024 CONTEST\n\nHealthcare has traditionally been a strength for Democrats, an idea once challenged by the trepidation surrounding former President Barack Obama's signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act, before it passed and the tide of public opinion turned in its favor. Democrats then leveraged the issue by pledging to expand abortion access ahead of last year's midterm elections after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. They also campaigned on the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, through which Biden capped the price of insulin for seniors and permitted Medicare to negotiate the cost of several drugs.\n\nDemocratic strategist Colin Seeberger described Biden's strategy of amplifying healthcare as \"smart\" because it demonstrates who is \"making people's lives better\" and who is \"pushing an extreme MAGA agenda.\"\n\n\"While Donald Trump is promising to terminate the ACA and take healthcare away from tens of millions of Americans, President Biden has passed laws to cut healthcare premiums by $800, cap insulin costs at $35, and negotiate for lower drug prices,\" Seeberger, a communications senior adviser at the Center for American Progress Action, told the Washington Examiner. \"The contrast in who is actually fighting for the American people could not be more clear.\"\n\nFor Middlebury College political science professor Bertram Johnson, Biden's \"issue ownership\" is \"a tried and true strategy\" of changing the topic of conversation to one that benefits his party.\n\n\"It's easier to shift the subject away from lesser issues than it is to try to distract voters from the economy, which is almost always near the top of their minds,\" Johnson said. \"Rightly or wrongly, voters tend to pay less attention to foreign affairs, especially when the nation is not itself at war, so the administration might have more luck in elevating healthcare over that issue in particular.\"\n\nGeorge Mason University policy and government professor Jeremy Mayer recommended that Biden \"get to the comparison part of the election,\" contending the public is currently \"judging Biden in a vacuum\" and considering whether they approve of him as an individual rather than whether they prefer him in a matchup against Trump.\n\n\"That second question, when voters are truly focused on it, should work out better for the octogenarian in the White House than the current polling would suggest,\" he said. \"Trump is not only nearly as old as Biden, but he has said and done things that voters will be reminded of more and more as November approaches.\"\n\nBiden's address Thursday at the National Institutes of Health about his progress in lowering drug prices came after Trump wrote on social media last month that he is \"seriously looking at alternatives\" to the ACA because its cost is \"out of control, plus it's not good healthcare.\" Former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal wrote an op-ed this week regarding his proposals for repealing and replacing the ACA, producing more fodder for Democrats who are eager to remind voters how previous attempts to do so ended.\n\nDuring his speech, Biden claimed to have beat \"Big Pharma\" when he signed the Inflation Reduction Act, a hallmark of his administration.\n\n\"My legislation finally gives Medicare the power to negotiate to lower drug prices, like the Department of Veterans Affairs has been able to do for a long time,\" he said. \"Now Medicare is able to do that. We've been fighting for decades -- and I literally mean decades -- to give Medicare that right.\"\n\nSign up for free: Springs AM Update Your morning rundown of the latest news from Colorado Springs and around the country overnight and the stories to follow throughout the day delivered to your inbox each evening.\n\nSign Up View all of our newsletters.

View all of our newsletters.\n\nBiden additionally took the opportunity to emphasize the lack of Republican support for the measure, noting that the legislation passed with \"no help from the other team at all.\"\n\n\"Trump promised for four years to have a healthcare plan much better than Obamacare,\" Mayer, of George Mason, said. \"Joe Biden isn't popular with the American people right now. Obamacare, however, is. Many of its provisions, separately presented to the public, are even more popular. Those are the kind of comparisons, no plan vs. popular plan, that will help Biden in November.\"\n\n\"Should he talk more about the economy? Eventually,\" he added.\n\nBiden's address, too, comes as abortion cases at the state level to the Supreme Court are again making national headlines. The Supreme Court, for example, announced it will review an appeals court decision that restricted the use of mifepristone, one drug in a two-pill chemical abortion regimen.\n\nThe White House and Biden campaign commented on a Texas Supreme Court move to stop mother-of-two Kate Cox, 31, from obtaining an abortion after she was advised her fetus had trisomy 18, a fatal chromosomal condition that could have affected her own fertility as well.\n\n\"Legal and medical chaos, as we are witnessing in states like Texas, Kentucky and Arizona, is a direct result of Roe v. Wade being overturned, and as we predicted would happen, women's health and lives now hang in the balance,\" Biden wrote in a statement. \"Republican elected officials have imposed dangerous abortion bans that jeopardize women's health, force them to travel out of state for care, and threaten to criminalize doctors. Their agenda is extreme and out-of-step with the vast majority of Americans.\"\n\n\"The vice president and I will continue to fight to protect access to reproductive healthcare and to urge Congress to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade now so that women in every state have the right to make their own health care decisions,\" he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nA Wall Street Journal poll this month found Trump led Biden in a hypothetical one-on-one rematch by 4 percentage points and 6 points when respondents were asked about third-party candidates. Trump had a double-digit advantage over Biden concerning who the public trusts more on the economy, crime, and the Israel-Hamas war. Meanwhile, more people trusted Biden than Trump on abortion.\n\nA second poll released Thursday by Morning Consult found that Biden is narrowly ahead of Trump in five swing states -- Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin -- on the issue of healthcare, with at least six in 10 voters saying it is \"very\" important in deciding how to cast their ballot.\n\nOriginal Location: Biden goes back to basics on healthcare as Trump outpolls him on economy\n\nWashington Examiner Videos\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE",

The takeover came a year after Hamas defeated Abbas' Fatah party in parliament elections and the rivals failed to form a unity government.\n\nA senior U.S. official said that Sullivan and others have discussed the prospect of having those associated with the Palestinian Authority security forces before the Hamas takeover serve as the \"nucleus\" of postwar peacekeeping in Gaza.\n\nIt was one idea of many being considered for establishing security in Gaza, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with White House ground rules.

        "title": "Biden goes back to basics on healthcare as Trump outpolls him on economy",
        "body": "President Joe Biden and his allies are getting back to their roots by highlighting healthcare, an issue that the public has historically associated more closely with Democrats.\n\nBut as former President Donald Trump outperforms Biden on some of voters' top priorities, from the economy to national security, Biden is being encouraged to promote his record on healthcare before next year's election.\n\nBIDEN'S OFF-RAMP SHOULD HE BOW OUT OF THE 2024 CONTEST\n\nHealthcare has traditionally been a strength for Democrats, an idea once challenged by the trepidation surrounding former President Barack Obama's signature legislation, the Affordable Care Act, before it passed and the tide of public opinion turned in its favor. Democrats then leveraged the issue by pledging to expand abortion access ahead of last year's midterm elections after the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade. They also campaigned on the passage of the Inflation Reduction Act, through which Biden capped the price of insulin for seniors and permitted Medicare to negotiate the cost of several drugs.\n\nDemocratic strategist Colin Seeberger described Biden's strategy of amplifying healthcare as \"smart\" because it demonstrates who is \"making people's lives better\" and who is \"pushing an extreme MAGA agenda.\"\n\n\"While Donald Trump is promising to terminate the ACA and take healthcare away from tens of millions of Americans, President Biden has passed laws to cut healthcare premiums by $800, cap insulin costs at $35, and negotiate for lower drug prices,\" Seeberger, a communications senior adviser at the Center for American Progress Action, told the Washington Examiner. \"The contrast in who is actually fighting for the American people could not be more clear.\"\n\nFor Middlebury College political science professor Bertram Johnson, Biden's \"issue ownership\" is \"a tried and true strategy\" of changing the topic of conversation to one that benefits his party.\n\n\"It's easier to shift the subject away from lesser issues than it is to try to distract voters from the economy, which is almost always near the top of their minds,\" Johnson said. \"Rightly or wrongly, voters tend to pay less attention to foreign affairs, especially when the nation is not itself at war, so the administration might have more luck in elevating healthcare over that issue in particular.\"\n\nGeorge Mason University policy and government professor Jeremy Mayer recommended that Biden \"get to the comparison part of the election,\" contending the public is currently \"judging Biden in a vacuum\" and considering whether they approve of him as an individual rather than whether they prefer him in a matchup against Trump.\n\n\"That second question, when voters are truly focused on it, should work out better for the octogenarian in the White House than the current polling would suggest,\" he said. \"Trump is not only nearly as old as Biden, but he has said and done things that voters will be reminded of more and more as November approaches.\"\n\nBiden's address Thursday at the National Institutes of Health about his progress in lowering drug prices came after Trump wrote on social media last month that he is \"seriously looking at alternatives\" to the ACA because its cost is \"out of control, plus it's not good healthcare.\" Former Louisiana Gov. Bobby Jindal wrote an op-ed this week regarding his proposals for repealing and replacing the ACA, producing more fodder for Democrats who are eager to remind voters how previous attempts to do so ended.\n\nDuring his speech, Biden claimed to have beat \"Big Pharma\" when he signed the Inflation Reduction Act, a hallmark of his administration.\n\n\"My legislation finally gives Medicare the power to negotiate to lower drug prices, like the Department of Veterans Affairs has been able to do for a long time,\" he said. \"Now Medicare is able to do that. We've been fighting for decades -- and I literally mean decades -- to give Medicare that right.\"\n\nBiden additionally took the opportunity to emphasize the lack of Republican support for the measure, noting that the legislation passed with \"no help from the other team at all.\"\n\n\"Trump promised for four years to have a healthcare plan much better than Obamacare,\" Mayer, of George Mason, said. \"Joe Biden isn't popular with the American people right now. Obamacare, however, is. Many of its provisions, separately presented to the public, are even more popular. Those are the kind of comparisons, no plan vs. popular plan, that will help Biden in November.\"\n\n\"Should he talk more about the economy? Eventually,\" he added.\n\nBiden's address, too, comes as abortion cases at the state level to the Supreme Court are again making national headlines. The Supreme Court, for example, announced it will review an appeals court decision that restricted the use of mifepristone, one drug in a two-pill chemical abortion regimen.\n\nThe White House and Biden campaign commented on a Texas Supreme Court move to stop mother-of-two Kate Cox, 31, from obtaining an abortion after she was advised her fetus had trisomy 18, a fatal chromosomal condition that could have affected her own fertility as well.\n\n\"Legal and medical chaos, as we are witnessing in states like Texas, Kentucky and Arizona, is a direct result of Roe v. Wade being overturned, and as we predicted would happen, women's health and lives now hang in the balance,\" Biden wrote in a statement. \"Republican elected officials have imposed dangerous abortion bans that jeopardize women's health, force them to travel out of state for care, and threaten to criminalize doctors. Their agenda is extreme and out-of-step with the vast majority of Americans.\"\n\n\"The vice president and I will continue to fight to protect access to reproductive healthcare and to urge Congress to restore the protections of Roe v. Wade now so that women in every state have the right to make their own health care decisions,\" he said.\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE WASHINGTON EXAMINER\n\nA Wall Street Journal poll this month found Trump led Biden in a hypothetical one-on-one rematch by 4 percentage points and 6 points when respondents were asked about third-party candidates. Trump had a double-digit advantage over Biden concerning who the public trusts more on the economy, crime, and the Israel-Hamas war. Meanwhile, more people trusted Biden than Trump on abortion.\n\nA second poll released Thursday by Morning Consult found that Biden is narrowly ahead of Trump in five swing states -- Arizona, Michigan, Nevada, Pennsylvania, and Wisconsin -- on the issue of healthcare, with at least six in 10 voters saying it is \"very\" important in deciding how to cast their ballot.",

        "title": "Biden envoy to meet with Abbas as the US floats a possible Palestinian security role in postwar Gaza",
        "body": "RAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- The United States national security adviser and the Palestinian president were set Friday to discuss postwar arrangements for Gaza -- which, according to a senior U.S. official, could include reactivating Palestinian security forces driven out by Hamas in its 2007 takeover of the territory.\n\nThe proposal, floated as one of several, was the first specific indicator of Washington's vision for security arrangements in Gaza if Israel achieves its U.S.-backed objective to end Hamas control of the besieged enclave.\n\nAny role for Palestinian security forces in Gaza is bound to elicit strong opposition from Israel, which seeks to maintain an open-ended security presence there and says it won't allow a postwar foothold for the internationally backed Palestinian Authority, a West Bank-based autonomy government led by President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nOn Thursday, Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, spoke to Israeli leaders about a timetable for winding down the intense combat phase of the war.\n\nThe offensive, triggered by the unprecedented Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, has flattened much of northern Gaza and driven 80% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million from their homes. Displaced people have squeezed into shelters mainly in the south in a spiraling humanitarian crisis.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden's administration has shown unease over Israel's failure to reduce civilian casualties and its plans for the future of Gaza, but the White House continues to offer wholehearted support for Israel with weapons shipments and diplomatic backing.\n\n\"I want them to be focused on how to save civilian lives,\" Biden said Thursday when asked if he wants Israel to scale down its operations by the end of the month. \"Not stop going after Hamas, but be more careful.\"\n\nWhite House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Sullivan talked with Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu about moving to \"lower intensity operations\" sometime \"in the near future.\"\n\nIt was not clear to what extent the U.S. and Israel differ on the timetable. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told Sullivan that it would take months to destroy Hamas, but did not say in his statement whether his estimate referred to the current phase of heavy combat.\n\nGallant has said this phase would be followed by lower-intensity campaign to stamp out any pockets of Hamas resistance.\n\nA deadly Hamas ambush on Israeli troops in Gaza City this week showed the group's resilience and called into question whether Israel can defeat it without wiping out the entire territory.\n\nIsrael's air and ground assault over the past 10 weeks has killed more than 18,700 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. Thousands more are missing and feared dead beneath the rubble.\n\nThe ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths. Its latest count did not specify how many were women and minors, but they have consistently made up around two-thirds of the dead in previous tallies.\n\nOn Friday morning, communications services still appeared to be down across Gaza. The Palestinian telecommunications provider Paltel had announced Thursday evening that services were cut off due to ongoing fighting.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes and tank shelling continued overnight and into Friday, including in the city of Rafah, part of the shrinking areas of tiny, densely populated Gaza to which Palestinian civilians had been told by Israel to evacuate. At last one person was killed in an airstrike early Friday, according to an Associated Press journalist who saw the body arriving at a local hospital.\n\nIsraelis remain strongly supportive of the war and see it as necessary to prevent a repeat of Oct. 7, when Palestinian militants attacked communities across southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 240 hostage. A total of 116 soldiers have been killed in the ground offensive, which began Oct. 27.\n\nPalestinian support for Hamas has tripled in the West Bank, with a small uptick in Gaza, according to a poll published Wednesday. Still, a majority of Palestinians do not back Hamas, according to the survey, which had an error margin of 4 percentage points.\n\nSullivan was scheduled to meet Friday with Abbas, who lost control of Gaza when Hamas drove out his security forces in 2007.

        "body": "By KARIN LAUB, NAJIB JOBAIN and BASSEM MROUE - Associated Press\n\nRAMALLAH, West Bank (AP) -- The United States national security adviser and the Palestinian president were set Friday to discuss postwar arrangements for Gaza -- which, according to a senior U.S. official, could include reactivating Palestinian security forces driven out by Hamas in its 2007 takeover of the territory.\n\nThe proposal, floated as one of several, was the first specific indicator of Washington's vision for security arrangements in Gaza if Israel achieves its U.S.-backed objective to end Hamas control of the besieged enclave.\n\nAny role for Palestinian security forces in Gaza is bound to elicit strong opposition from Israel, which seeks to maintain an open-ended security presence there and says it won't allow a postwar foothold for the internationally backed Palestinian Authority, a West Bank-based autonomy government led by President Mahmoud Abbas.\n\nOn Thursday, Jake Sullivan, the national security adviser, spoke to Israeli leaders about a timetable for winding down the intense combat phase of the war.\n\nThe offensive, triggered by the unprecedented Oct. 7 Hamas attack on Israel, has flattened much of northern Gaza and driven 80% of Gaza's population of 2.3 million from their homes. Displaced people have squeezed into shelters mainly in the south in a spiraling humanitarian crisis.\n\nU.S. President Joe Biden's administration has shown unease over Israel's failure to reduce civilian casualties and its plans for the future of Gaza, but the White House continues to offer wholehearted support for Israel with weapons shipments and diplomatic backing.\n\n\"I want them to be focused on how to save civilian lives,\" Biden said Thursday when asked if he wants Israel to scale down its operations by the end of the month. \"Not stop going after Hamas, but be more careful.\"\n\nWhite House National Security Council spokesperson John Kirby said Sullivan talked with Israeli President Benjamin Netanyahu about moving to \"lower intensity operations\" sometime \"in the near future.\"\n\nIt was not clear to what extent the U.S. and Israel differ on the timetable. Israeli Defense Minister Yoav Gallant told Sullivan that it would take months to destroy Hamas, but did not say in his statement whether his estimate referred to the current phase of heavy combat.\n\nGallant has said this phase would be followed by lower-intensity campaign to stamp out any pockets of Hamas resistance.\n\nA deadly Hamas ambush on Israeli troops in Gaza City this week showed the group's resilience and called into question whether Israel can defeat it without wiping out the entire territory.\n\nIsrael's air and ground assault over the past 10 weeks has killed more than 18,700 Palestinians, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-run Gaza. Thousands more are missing and feared dead beneath the rubble.\n\nThe ministry does not differentiate between civilian and combatant deaths. Its latest count did not specify how many were women and minors, but they have consistently made up around two-thirds of the dead in previous tallies.\n\nOn Friday morning, communications services still appeared to be down across Gaza. The Palestinian telecommunications provider Paltel had announced Thursday evening that services were cut off due to ongoing fighting.\n\nIsraeli airstrikes and tank shelling continued overnight and into Friday, including in the city of Rafah, part of the shrinking areas of tiny, densely populated Gaza to which Palestinian civilians had been told by Israel to evacuate. At last one person was killed in an airstrike early Friday, according to an Associated Press journalist who saw the body arriving at a local hospital.\n\nIsraelis remain strongly supportive of the war and see it as necessary to prevent a repeat of Oct. 7, when Palestinian militants attacked communities across southern Israel, killing around 1,200 people, mostly civilians, and taking some 240 hostage. A total of 116 soldiers have been killed in the ground offensive, which began Oct. 27.\n\nPalestinian support for Hamas has tripled in the West Bank, with a small uptick in Gaza, according to a poll published Wednesday. Still, a majority of Palestinians do not back Hamas, according to the survey, which had an error margin of 4 percentage points.\n\nSullivan was scheduled to meet Friday with Abbas, who lost control of Gaza when Hamas drove out his security forces in 2007. The takeover came a year after Hamas defeated Abbas' Fatah party in parliament elections and the rivals failed to form a unity government.\n\nA senior U.S. official said that Sullivan and others have discussed the prospect of having those associated with the Palestinian Authority security forces before the Hamas takeover serve as the \"nucleus\" of postwar peacekeeping in Gaza.\n\nIt was one idea of many being considered for establishing security in Gaza, said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity in line with White House ground rules. He said such talks were taking place with Israel, the Palestinian Authority and regional partners.\n\nThe U.S. has said it eventually wants to see the West Bank and Gaza under a unified Palestinian government, as a precursor to Palestinian statehood -- an idea soundly rejected by Netanyahu, who leads a right-wing government that is opposed to Palestinian statehood.\n\nThe Palestinian prime minister told The Associated Press it's time for the United States to deal more firmly with Israel, particularly on Washington's calls for postwar negotiations for a two-state solution to the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.\n\n\"Now that the United States has talked the talk, we want Washington to walk the walk,\" Mohammed Shtayyeh said Thursday. \"If the United States cannot deliver Israel, who can?\"\n\nAs part of postwar scenarios, Washington has also called for revitalizing the Palestinian Authority, without letting on whether such reforms would require personnel changes or general elections, which last took place 17 years ago. The 88-year-old Abbas is widely unpopular, with this week's poll indicating close to 90% of Palestinians want him to resign.\n\nJobain reported from Rafah, Gaza Strip, and Mroue from Beirut.

        "title": "Amid rising anti-Semitism, Texas bishop leads interfaith Hanukkah celebration",
        "body": "NEW YORK - With antisemitism on the rise across the United States, Bishop Michael Sis of San Angelo, Texas, took a public stance of solidarity with the Jewish community Dec. 13, participating in and speaking at an interfaith Hanukkah celebration he himself helped organize.\n\nIn remarks, Sis said he hopes the Catholic presence at the celebration \"expresses respect, friendship, and a desire for mutual understanding.\" He also emphasized the importance of Hanukkah for all faiths, considering the story is one of religious freedom.\n\n\"This evening, this Hanukkah celebration here in San Angelo is a wonderful opportunity to appreciate an important tradition in the lives of our Jewish brothers and sisters, and it is also a chance to reflect on the fact that the story of Hanukkah is actually important for all faiths,\" Sis remarked.\n\n\"We can all find inspiration in it, because it is a celebration of religious liberty - the right to practice one's religion according to the dictates of one's own conscience,\" Sis continued. \"That's what was at stake for the Maccabees in Israel 164 years before Christ. That's what is at stake today around the globe, in North Korea, China, Myanmar, Nicaragua, Nigeria, and a host of other places.\"\n\nSis went on to list of number of hopes he has for the future, including that people around the world can freely express their faith regardless of their religion, and \"that all of us, from so many different religions, may be able to exist, in mutual respect, side by side, in peace and justice.\"\n\nThe interfaith Hanukkah celebration, held Dec. 13, was the first of its kind in San Angelo in which Sis has participated. He told Crux that the idea actually came from a Catholic woman in San Angelo, who suggested the diocese hold some sort of public event in solidarity with the Jewish people.\n\nAntisemitism has increased in the United States since the Hamas' Oct. 7 terrorist attack on Israel, where more than 1,200 people were killed. In the months since, as a war between Israel and Hamas ensued, more than 18,400 Palestinians have died, according to the Health Ministry in Hamas-controlled territory. Israel has said that 113 of its soldiers have died.\n\nHamas also still has more than 150 of the 240 hostages it took on Oct. 7.\n\nStateside, the war has led to a rise in antisemitism. The Anti-Defamation League, which tracks antisemitic incidents nationwide, reported this week that between Oct. 7 and Dec. 7 there were a total of 2,031 antisemitic incidents, up from 465 incidents during the same period last year.\n\nThese incidents include, according to the organization, 40 incidents of physical assault, 337 incidents of vandalism, 749 incidents of verbal or written harassment and 905 rallies including antisemitic rhetoric.\n\nAt the Dec. 13 Hanukkah celebration, Sis quoted a Nov. 28 2022 statement from the U.S. Bishops conference, where it stated that \"in unequivocal terms, we condemn any and all violence directed at the Jewish people, whether motivated by religious, racial, or political grievances.\"\n\nPresent at the celebration were more than 75 people, including Jews, Catholics, Methodists Baptists, Church of Christ members, and non-denominational believers, Sis said. The celebration was held in the hall of a Methodist church in the heart of downtown San Angelo.\n\nAlong with Sis, remarks came from Pastor Scott Bradford of First Methodist Church and Ami Mizell-Flint, president of Congregation Beth Israel. The celebration concluded with a Menorah lighting ceremony, in which Sis and the other faith leaders participated.\n\nSis later told Crux that interfaith collaboration \"is essential for building a more just and peaceful society.\"\n\n\"It allows us to acknowledge our differences yet collaborate on what we have in common,\" Sis said. \"It provides us with better channels of communication to confront problems before they get out of hand, and it leads to more creative and effective solutions to problems in our community through the synergy and good will that is created through these encounters.\"",

        "body": "WASHINGTON | CONGRESS\n\nWASHINGTON -- The House passed a defense policy bill Thursday that authorizes the biggest pay raise for troops in more than two decades, overcoming objections from some conservatives concerned the measure did not do enough to restrict the Pentagon's diversity initiatives, abortion travel policy and gender-affirming health care for transgender service members.\n\nThe $886 billion defense bill was approved by a vote of 310118 and now goes to President Joe Biden after the Senate overwhelmingly passed it Wednesday. It is likely the last piece of major legislation Congress will consider before leaving for the holiday break.\n\nLawmakers departed Washington on Thursday without a deal to pass wartime support for Ukraine, even as Biden's administration raced to negotiate with Senate Republicans who demand changes to U.S. border security policy in return.\n\nPeople are also reading...

Here's how to watch Priest dies after being stabbed in Fort Calhoun church rectory Aquaculture is the newest commodity in Nebraska City Lakeview Super Senior: Yordi Dominguez Aquinas places first, Blue River and SRC second at North Bend\n\nThe Senate planned to come back next week in hopes of finalizing a deal to place new restrictions on asylum claims at the U.S. border and pass the $110 billion package of aid for Ukraine, Israel and other national security needs. But the House showed no sign of returning to push the legislation through the full Congress.\n\nThursday's spending bill represents about a 3% increase from the prior year. The bill serves as a blueprint for programs Congress will seek to fund through follow-up spending bills.\n\nLawmakers have been negotiating a final defense policy bill for months after each chamber passed strikingly different versions in July. Some of the priorities championed by social conservatives were a no-go for Democrats. Negotiators dropped them from the final version to get it over the finish line.\n\nThat did not go over well with some Republican lawmakers, though most voted for a bill that traditionally has broad, bipartisan support.\n\nMost notably, the bill does not include language sought by House Republicans to restrict gender affirming health care for transgender service members and it does not block the Pentagon's abortion travel policy, which allows reimbursement for travel expenses when a service member has to go out of state for an abortion or other reproductive care.\n\nRepublicans did win some concessions on diversity and inclusion training in the military. For example, the bill freezes hiring for such training until a full accounting of the programming and costs is completed and reported to Congress.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Politics Legislation Trade Job Market Armed Forces Law Revenue Services Be the first to know\n\nGet local news delivered to your inbox!\n\nSign up! * I understand and agree that registration on or use of this site constitutes agreement to its user agreement and privacy policy.",

        "title": "2024 NHL Draft Notebook: Iginla follows father's path | NHL.com",
        "body": "Jarome Iginla was a mainstay with the Calgary Flames from 1996 to 2013, leading them in scoring 11 times and twice winning the Maurice Richard Trophy as the top goal-scorer in the NHL. He won the Art Ross Trophy as the League's top point-producer in 2001-02, and finished with 1,300 points (625 goals, 675 assists) in 1,554 games in a career that included stops with the Pittsburgh Penguins, Boston Bruins, Colorado Avalanche and Los Angeles Kings. He is tied for 16th all-time in goals with Joe Sakic.\n\n\"I don't think there's any one particular catch phrase he uses but he says whatever is needed to be said at that moment, whether it's something easy to hear or not so easy,\" Tij said. \"He'll let me know and make sure that I'm in a good spot.\"\n\nTij (6-foot, 186 pounds), who can play center and wing, was promoted to an A rating on NHL Central Scouting's preliminary players to watch list last month and is a potential first-round candidate in the 2024 draft. He was listed as a B-rated skater in October.\n\n\"He certainly shows some similarities to his dad; similar size and build and he has a heavy shot with a quick release like his dad,\" said John Williams of NHL Central Scouting. \"It's always interesting to watch these second-generation players to see how they compare with their fathers. Tij is one that plays and looks similar to his dad on the ice.\"\n\nIginla leads the Rockets with 23 goals, six power-play goals and 136 shots on goal and is second with 37 points in 30 games. The left-handed shot was traded to Kelowna by Seattle in exchange for two draft picks and forward Grady Lenton on June 7.\n\nHe's recognized as a goal-scorer with a big shot and good hands around the cage. His compete level and hockey sense are also big attributes of his game.\n\n\"I think I have good edges and one of the strengths to my game right now is my goal-scoring ability,\" Tij said. \"I just put the puck in the net and make the most out of my chances. I think I have good scoring touch around the net.\"\n\nWilliams said Iginla's performance at the 2022 Under-17 Hockey Challenge was a big moment for him as he had seven points (two goals, five assists) in seven games to held Canada Red to a silver medal.\n\n\"Last year, he was in Seattle on an older team that went to the Memorial Cup, so he didn't see a lot of ice time,\" Williams said. \"The Under-17 was a pretty good indication as to where his game might go. He started out lower in the lineup but earned more ice time as the event progressed.\"\n\nTij also has two hockey-playing siblings: sister Jade Iginla, 19, a sophomore forward at Brown University, and brother Joe Iginla, 15, a forward chosen No. 12 by Edmonton in the 2023 WHL bantam draft.\n\nIginla has a good idea what it will take to earn a chance to play in the NHL someday.\n\n\"You got to be able to skate. The game is really fast and if you can't skate, you're going to be spending more energy getting to where you need to be,\" he said. \"The NHL has the best players in the world and the strongest players, so you got to be strong and powerful. I think another big one would be smarts and being able to think it. The game is fast, so you got to be able to have a great processor to be able to think ahead and anticipate. I think those are kind of three big things that you want to have if you want to play in the NHL.\"\n\nZeev Buium, D, University of Denver (NCAA): Buium (6-0, 183) leads all Denver defensemen and ranks third overall with 25 points (five goals, 20 assists) in 18 games as a freshman. The left-handed shot received an A rating on NHL Central Scouting's preliminary players to watch list for the 2024 NHL Draft. He's the son of Israeli immigrants who married in Israel after serving in the army before moving to Los Angeles. Buium was invited to USA Hockey's world junior selection camp this week for possible inclusion on the U.S. National Junior Team competing in the 2024 IIHF World Junior Championship in Sweden from Dec. 26-Jan. 5.\n\n\"He wants to win, wants to make an impact, night in and night out,\" Denver coach and U.S. National Junior Team coach David Carle said. \"He's very teachable, especially without the puck. His puck game fits well within our system and how we play the puck possession style in Denver.\"",

        "body": "The USAID Africa Trade and Investment (ATI) program is designed to bolster the U.S. Government's ability to boost trade and investment to, from, and within the African continent. The continent-wide program is USAID's flagship effort in support of the Prosper Africa initiative and will expand and accelerate two-way trade and investment between African nations and the United States.\n\nDriven by market demand, ATI embraces innovative approaches to achieve its goals. ATI is designed as a small, core set of centrally coordinated technical and institutional support activities, and a large, flexible performance-based subcontracting and grants under contract facility designed to support the needs and opportunities that USAID Missions and the private sector identify.\n\nBackground\n\nThe USAID Africa Trade and Investment Activity aims to generate higher levels of export sales between Africa and the U.S. in line with the Prosper Africa objectives. One mechanism is through trade promotion activities via a fully integrated array of support services provided before, during, and after trade fair events such as the Sourcing at MAGIC exhibition.\n\nTo maximize the results stemming from MAGIC, support will be provided before, during and after the event to ensure that export ready African textile and apparel firms are positioned in the best way possible to generate large export orders. U.S. firms that are interested in sourcing from Africa will be identified and matched with the appropriate African factories. The Activity, as per the previous event, will work with specialized Trade Promotion Service Providers (TPSPs) . TPSP(s) will focus heavily on the U.S. market by identifying buyers who have an interest in sourcing textiles and apparel from the African continent, facilitating linkages at the show and supporting post-show deal closure. The demand from these buyers will be matched with the export ready firms from Africa that are in the best position to satisfy buyer requirements. Participating firms from across the continent will be supported with preparing for the show. The Activity will make every effort to identify TPSPs and investor industry experts that can handle the United States buyer facilitation and the coordination and preparation with African firms.\n\nThe USAID Africa Trade and Investment Southern Africa Buy-in Activity seeks to support at least 30 Textile and apparel, home textile and leather goods sectors firms and engage short-term technical assistance (STTA) to coordinate efforts with ATI to recruit, screen, prepare firms to exhibit in-person at the Sourcing at Magic (MAGIC) Show, (https://www.sourcingatmagic.com) taking place between February 13-15, 2024, at the Las Vegas Convention Center, Las Vegas, United States.\n\nSourcing at MAGIC is one of the premier fashion tradeshows in the US and is held twice a year (February and August) in Las Vegas. The event showcases men's, women's and children's apparel, footwear, accessories, and manufacturing resources from around the world. MAGIC brings together a global audience of over 32,000 retail buyers and 860 brands covering 60 countries, influencers, media, and leaders together under one roof. It is well attended by major competitors from Asian countries, such as China, shedding light where African suppliers should be and have a comparative advantage to enter and/or expand into the U.S. market.\n\nPosition Overview and Objectives\n\nThe Regional MAGIC Trade Show Consultant will provide support to recruit, screen, prepare firms to exhibit in-person at the Sourcing at Magic (MAGIC) Show and follow-up on post show activities and reporting in collaboration with ATI as follows:\n\nThe consultant will support and coordinate with Southern Africa country teams to identify, screen and select export ready and near export ready firms, prepare selected firms to exhibit in-person in advance of MAGIC February 2024 trade show and follow-up with firms post the show.\n\nResponsibilities\n\nThe Project aims to appoint a consultant, to support and prepare regional partners to participate at the Magic show. The consultant is expected to fulfil the following roles and responsibilities:\n\nThe Regional MAGIC Trade Show Consultant will report to the USAID Africa Trade and Investment Activity Regional Director working closely with the Trade Specialist.\n\nABOUT DAI\n\nDAI is a global development company with corporate offices in the United States, the United Kingdom, EU, Nigeria, Pakistan, and Palestine and project operations worldwide.

        "body": "Been a minute since I chimed in about Bike Happy Hour. Just want to say it's been really to see such a healthy group of folks show up each week -- even through this chilly and (sometimes) wet winter weather! Keep reading to find out how it's been going lately and what to expect if you come out.\n\nLast night was week 37 and I had a wonderful time. If you haven't come out since the big summer blowouts on the Gorges Beer patio, you'll notice a bit different vibe at our winter location across the street at Ankeny Tap & Table. We've been outside on Ankeny plaza next the pub almost every week and it's a much more convivial gathering as we huddle around in our coats and naturally come together seeking warmth (we go inside if it's unbearable and/or wet). The crowd is smaller so it's more relaxed and we'll often be all together in one big group.\n\nOwing to all the big news this week, last night we had an impromptu, spirited, roundtable chat. People shared opinions about how best to frame advocacy arguments and I ranted about a few things. I'm always open to debates and conversations... it's one of my favorite aspects of Happy Hour! I loved how the group last night heard from different voices and even folks who showed up for the first time got in on the conversation (hi Camilla, Jupiter, Craig, Neil, Forrest, Mark and others!).\n\nBike Happy Hour isn't owned by anyone, so everyone is welcome to come and use the space however they see fit (within reason of course, I do reserve the right to manage the space as the main organizer).\n\nThe last few weeks we've had folks set up and sell crafts on the dining tables. Max from Flat Tire Creations was there with her amazing items made from recycled bike parts. And Nando of Chronic Carry fame shared his very cool beverage holsters and various smoking-related accessories. A few weeks ago one of our regulars named Sabs started a ride from the pub toward the end of Bike Happy Hour. She made a speech about how she, as a Jewish person, wants a ceasefire in the war between Israel and Palestine.\n\nWe've also continued our tradition of having local candidates swing by. Two weeks ago we had City Council District 3 Candidate Joseph Emerson stop by. He took the mic and shared his view of what he wants Portland to look like (more walkable and safe for little ones, including his one-year-old daughter). It was so cool to sit in a small group and have a conversation with someone running for office!\n\nIt's also been great to see families come out. Every week we've got at least a few little ones running around. Last night I let Odin and Athena (regulars who come with mom and dad Melissa and Chris) help me with the event sign. I just love the energy little people bring.\n\nI'll leave you with a tease... You've got to try the new churro waffles on the Ankeny Tap menu! I've been buying several plates of them each week just to sweeten things up. I love seeing everyone's smile when they try it. They're warm and a bit crispy with all that churro goodness, drizzled with chocolate syrup. And of course the rest of their menu is really good (I tried the BLT last night and loved it!).\n\nSo whatever reasons brings you out. Thanks! With your help and support, we've created a space that's welcoming and fun, and continues to draw new faces each week.",

        "title": "NeuroSense Reports New Data: Statistically Significant Clinical Efficacy in Phase 2b ALS Trial",
        "body": "CAMBRIDGE, Mass., Dec. 14, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- NeuroSense Therapeutics Ltd. (Nasdaq: NRSN) (\"NeuroSense\"), a company developing treatments for severe neurodegenerative diseases, today reported additional positive efficacy data from further evaluation of its Phase 2b trial (PARADIGM) with NeuroSense's lead drug candidate for amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (\"ALS\"), PrimeC.\n\nEvaluation of the pre-specified Per Protocol (PP) population analysis of the recent top-line results from PARADIGM revealed a statistically significant slowing of disease progression with a 37.4% (p=0.03) difference in the gold standard ALS tracking measure, the ALS Functional Rating Scale-Revised (\"ALSFRS-R\"), in favor of PrimeC vs placebo, and 17.2% (p=0.39) difference in Slow Vital Capacity (\"SVC\"), in favor of PrimeC vs placebo. The PP analysis population includes all participants who adhered to the trial protocol and treatment plan without any major protocol deviations. The goal of a PP analysis in clinical trials is to assess the efficacy of a treatment under optimal conditions, thereby providing a clearer understanding of how well the treatment works when implemented as intended, contributing to a more comprehensive view of the trial results. PARADIGM's PP population analysis is pre-defined in the trial's statistical analysis plan, which includes 62 patients (43 active and 19 placebo) compared to 68 patients in the Intent to Treat (ITT) population (45 active and 23 placebo).\n\nPARADIGM is a prospective, multinational, randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled Phase 2b (NCT05357950) clinical trial. The trial's primary endpoints include: safety and tolerability, and ALS-related biomarkers TDP-43 and Prostagladin2. The trial's secondary endpoints include: clinical efficacy outcome measures, ALSFRS-R and SVC. ALSFRS-R is the most widely used ALS tracking tool accepted by the FDA, utilized by neurologists treating ALS patients, in clinical trials, and by other regulators to determine disease progression. It tracks 12 changes in a person's physical abilities over time including functions such as: speech, walking, climbing stairs, dressing/hygiene, handwriting, turning in bed, cutting food, salivation, swallowing, and breathing. SVC is a measurement of respiratory function.\n\nWhile PARADIGM is powered to demonstrate statistically significant changes in the trial's primary endpoints, the highly favorable clinical results seen in the PP analysis achieved an unexpected statistical significance.\n\nThe new data reported today comes on the heels of recent positive top-line safety and efficacy data of PARADIGM announced by NeuroSense. An analysis of the ITT top-line data from the 6-month double-blind segment of the trial showed clinically meaningful signs of efficacy with a 29% difference in ALSFRS-R (p=0.12) and a 13% difference in SVC (p=0.5), both in favor of PrimeC vs placebo. These data include all 68 people living with ALS enrolled in Canada, Italy, and Israel, with the exclusion of one patient who was misdiagnosed. Most patients enrolled in both the active and placebo arms of trial were concurrently treated with Riluzole, the ALS standard of care medication, indicating PrimeC slowed disease progression well beyond the level afforded by the FDA approved ALS drug.\n\nIn addition, the trial met its primary endpoint of safety and tolerability with results comparable to placebo, establishing a solid safety profile for PrimeC. 96% of the trial participants who completed the 6-month double-blind portion of the trial chose to receive treatment with PrimeC through a 12-month open label extension. Furthermore, to date, all participants that completed the 18-month trial treatment duration requested to continue taking PrimeC, which is provided to them via an Investigator Initiated Trial.\n\nNeuroSense expects to report results from a strategic collaboration with Biogen in January 2024, evaluating the impact of PrimeC on neurofilament levels in participants enrolled in PARADIGM. Upon receipt of results, Biogen has the right of first refusal to co-develop/ commercialize PrimeC for the treatment of ALS for a limited time following the results. The Company expects to report primary biomarker endpoints of ALS hallmarks TDP-43 and Prostagladin2, to evaluate PrimeC's biological activity and target engagement, in the first half of 2024 following the completion of the analysis of participants' plasma.\n\nAn End of Phase 2 meeting with the FDA and a Scientific Advice meeting with European Medicines Agency (EMA) to discuss these results and to determine the best path forward for PrimeC's development is expected in the first half of 2024.\n\n\"As we analyze the PARADIGM trial results, we continue to gain a better understanding of PrimeC's potential to render a significant and meaningful clinical benefit to people living with ALS. Today we are eager to share these new data with the ALS community, as we believe the PP analysis, demonstrating a statistically significant 37.4% difference in ALSFRS-R in patients treated with PrimeC vs. placebo, is an exceptional result,\" stated Alon Ben-Noon, NeuroSense's CEO. \"This data, in conjunction with hopefully correlative neurofilament readouts, will create a regulatory opportunity to advance PrimeC's development in a breakthrough manner toward the market.\"\n\nAbout ALS\n\nAmyotrophic lateral sclerosis (\"ALS\") is an incurable neurodegenerative disease that causes complete paralysis and death within 2-5 years from diagnosis. Every year, more than 5,000 patients are diagnosed with ALS in the U.S. alone, with an annual disease burden of $1 billion. The number of patients with ALS is expected to grow by 24% by 2040 in the U.S. and EU.\n\nAbout PrimeC\n\nPrimeC, NeuroSense's lead drug candidate, is a novel extended-release oral formulation composed of a unique fixed-dose combination of two FDA-approved drugs: ciprofloxacin and celecoxib. PrimeC is designed to synergistically target several key mechanisms of ALS that contribute to motor neuron degeneration, inflammation, iron accumulation and impaired ribonucleic acid (\"RNA\") regulation to potentially inhibit the progression of ALS. NeuroSense completed the 6-month double-blind portion of its Phase 2b ALS clinical trial which met its safety and tolerability endpoints, as well as showing a statistically significant slowing of disease progression in the pre-specified Per Protocol (PP) population. Additional data from the Phase 2b trial are expected H1 2024. PrimeC was granted Orphan Drug Designation by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration and the European Medicines Agency.\n\nAbout NeuroSense\n\nNeuroSense Therapeutics, Ltd. is a clinical-stage biotechnology company focused on discovering and developing treatments for patients suffering from debilitating neurodegenerative diseases. NeuroSense believes that these diseases, which include amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS), Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's disease, among others, represent one of the most significant unmet medical needs of our time, with limited effective therapeutic options available for patients to date. Due to the complexity of neurodegenerative diseases and based on strong scientific research on a large panel of related biomarkers, NeuroSense's strategy is to develop combined therapies targeting multiple pathways associated with these diseases.\n\nThis press release contains \"forward-looking statements\" that are subject to substantial risks and uncertainties.

        "body": "From her role on the U.S. Senate Appropriations Committee, and in particular the subcommittee for Homeland Security, Sen. Katie Britt (R-Montgomery) has been closely involved with the annual defense budget process, which completed its legislative phase today after passage from both chambers.\n\nBritt reflected on the final product by highlighting portions of the FY2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA) she helped secure. In particular, funding for servicemembers and their families' access to mental healthcare, commonsense border wall funding, and a continued fight for merit-based promotions within the ranks.\n\n\"Today, I voted to support the Fiscal Year 2024 NDAA, which contains major wins for Alabama, for our national defense, and for conservatives,\" Britt said.\n\nRELATED: Alabama military construction projects receive $300M+ boost in defense bill\n\n\"This legislation includes a 5.2 percent pay raise for our troops, forces the Biden Administration to resume construction of the wall at our southern border, and ensures that all future military promotions are solely based on an individual's performance and merit.\"\n\nBritt said the defense bill takes aim at China as \"our greatest geopolitical and national security threat\" as well as Iran and Hamas' unforgivable aggression against Israel and will deliver funds accordingly.\n\n\"I'm also especially proud to have included a provision in the NDAA that represents a positive step forward as we continue to work to better support the wellbeing of our servicemembers and their families,\" Britt said, referencing an amendment to require the Department of Defense to study military families ability to retain mental healthcare via telehealth services in between between postings.\n\nRELATED: Britt: 'Human traffickers, cartels and terrorists rule the day' under Biden\n\nBritt also drove home an NDAA-included provision that requires the Biden Administration to purpose millions of dollars of unused, ready-to-go border wall panels to build the wall on the Southern Border.\n\n\"In addition, this NDAA authorizes more than $316 million for improvements to Alabama's military bases and National Guard facilities. This is imperative to our state's ability to continue strengthening our national defense long into the future, and it supports tens of thousands of good-paying jobs in communities across Alabama,\" Britt said.\n\nGrayson Everett is the state and political editor for Yellowhammer News.

She pointed to the university administration's opportunity to strengthen UW-Madison's diversity purpose and to improve the ways with which student success and student experience are addressed.\n\nSSFC passes 2025 RecWell budget, hears Wisconsin Union segregated fee change requestThe University of Wisconsin Student Services Finance Committee met Thursday to hear the Wisconsin Unions' budget proposal for the 2025 Read...\n\nMnookin emphasized the importance of strengthening UW-Madison -- not only for students and faculty, but for the state of Wisconsin.\n\n\"It's my goal to make UW-Madison as strong as it can be,\" Mnookin said. \"We need to continue to work to demonstrate the incredible importance to our state's future.\"\n\nMnookin said supporting the \"belonging, success and flourishing\" of students of different identities, backgrounds and beliefs is a key element to strengthening UW-Madison, and remains a key priority in her second year as chancellor.\n\nVice Chancellor for Student Affairs Lori Reesor echoed this sentiment, adding that student support at UW-Madison ensures students are successful both in and out of the classroom. Reesor said Student Affairs has been especially focused on supporting students following attacks made on Israel by Hamas -- a militant group that governs the Gaza Strip and is classified by the U.S. as a terrorist group -- Oct. 7.\n\nThe ongoing Israel-Hamas war has drawn demonstrations in support of the state of Israel and the Palestinian people on and around campus. Reesor said it has impacted students of different religious identities on campus.\n\nUW Colombian Badgers Celebrate Día de las Velitas at Union SouthThe University of Wisconsin Colombian Badgers hosted a Día de las Velitas -- the Day of the Little Candles -- Read...\n\n\"We've done a lot of outreach to Jewish students, to Muslim students,\" Reesor said. \"Unfortunately some of their experiences on campus have been similar in that they don't feel supported, they don't feel safe, they don't feel that they can represent their full identity.\"\n\nReesor said this outreach has led her and the Student Affairs team to begin focusing on ways to better educate campus students and staff about religious identities and religious minority identities. She pointed to the recently opened Center for Interfaith Dialogue, which provides students with resources and programming for the exploration of religious identities.\n\nMnookin also commented on the Israel-Hamas war, saying she's spent time \"listening and engaging\" with students and community members affected by the events abroad, and by related events and actions closer to home.\n\nMnookin stressed that she remains focused on civil dialogue and engagement across differences, but acknowledges the challenges posed by the First Amendment's application to UW-Madison. Mnookin emphasized the importance of creating a community in which free speech and engagement across differences are acknowledged.\n\n\"I would also ask that in the ways that we communicate with each other about this, that we are attentive to and recognize that there are many viewpoints on these issues, and many ways that words can be heard,\" Mnookin said.",

        "body": "After bipartisan approval in the Senate, the House similarly passed the National Defense Authorization Act on Thursday\n\nConnecticut's defense companies and submarine industrial base will once again see major investments in a bill that Congress needs to pass annually to authorize military spending.\n\nIn addition to the typical boosts for Connecticut-based companies like Sikorsky and Pratt & Whitney, the legislation also approves the sale of three Virginia-class submarines manufactured in part by Electric Boat through a major international alliance.\n\nThe details of the AUKUS defense pact between Australia, the United Kingdom and the United States were announced in March, but Congress needed to implement the agreement. The defense bill authorizes parts of AUKUS, which includes Australia initially buying three nuclear-powered submarines from the U.S. But the first transfer is not expected to happen until the early 2030s.\n\n\"That's never happened before. There's a lot more work to be done in terms of making that a reality, but Congress gave its blessing to allow this very unique and unprecedented step to be taken amongst the three countries,\" said Rep. Joe Courtney, D-2nd District, who serves as ranking member of the House Armed Services Committee's subcommittee on Seapower and Projection Forces.\n\nAfter bipartisan approval in the Senate, the House similarly passed the National Defense Authorization Act on Thursday, sending the measure to President Joe Biden to sign into law. The bill authorizes a total of $886 billion including a 5.2% pay raise for service members -- the largest one in two decades -- as well as an increase in how housing allowances are determined for lower income service members and more funding for military child care.\n\nCourtney noted that there are 9,000 sailors and officers who work on the Naval Submarine Base New London in Groton that will stand to benefit from these measures.\n\nConnecticut's three big defense contractors -- Sikorsky, Electric Boat and Pratt & Whitney -- will see major investments once Congress passes its spending bills next year.\n\nThe NDAA authorizes funding for Sikorsky to build 15 CH-53K heavy lift helicopters and 50 Black Hawk helicopters. Courtney also requested another $22 million to upgrade the Army's Black Hawk current fleet.\n\nThe bill also enables $431 million for the F135 Engine Core Upgrade. The U.S. Department of Defense approved new contracts for Pratt & Whitney to remain as the sole provider of the military jet engine following a decades-long push by Connecticut's congressional delegation.\n\nAnd if the spending is approved next year, Electric Boat gets $2.4 billion for the Columbia-class submarine and $10.3 billion for the Virginia-class subs with most of that going toward two subs in 2024 and the rest of the funding for future construction in 2025 and 2026.\n\nOverall, the legislation authorizes $647 million for the submarine industrial base with another $1.2 billion for research and development.\n\n\"It also supports our domestic industrial base, particularly the union workforce right here in Connecticut, while strengthening our military readiness through support to our allies and partners and paving the way for investments in innovation and technology,\" said Rep. Rosa DeLauro, D-3rd District, who is the ranking member of the House Appropriations Committee.\n\nThe wide-ranging legislation also includes provisions led by Connecticut lawmakers to improve conditions in honor of service members from the state who have died.\n\nCourtney's proposal, named after Sergeant First Class Michael Clark who was from eastern Connecticut, extends the military's health care program. It provides TRICARE benefits for three years to family members of personnel who were killed less than 30 days after being activated.\n\nAnd legislation by Sen. Chris Murphy, D-Conn., and Sen. Richard Blumenthal, D-Conn., enables junior sailors to reside in commercial housing while their ship gets extended maintenance in a shipyard. It also increases the number of mental health counselors on Navy ships.\n\nThe measure is named after Xavier Sandor, a Master at Arms Seaman Recruit from Connecticut who was one of three crew members on the USS George Washington to die by suicide in 2022. The ship frequently lost power, heating and air conditioning as it underwent an overhaul.\n\nMurphy said the measure aims \"to make sure junior sailors aren't forced to endure the horrible conditions of a ship undergoing extended maintenance overhauls.\"\n\n\"I'm grateful to the Sandor family for sharing their son's heartbreaking story and working with me to ensure the Navy takes better care of its brave men and women,\" he added.\n\nIn regards to AUKUS, Congress approved the first two pillars of the agreement.\n\nThat includes the sale of the Virginia-class submarines to Australia with two from the Navy's inventory and one new sub. The bill also authorizes Australia's payment to the U.S. of about $3 billion to increase production and capacity.\n\nElectric Boat locations in Connecticut and Rhode Island handle much of the Virginia-class shipbuilding along with Huntington Ingalls Industries' Newport News Shipbuilding in Virginia. Australia will buy at least three of those subs, but has the potential to purchase two more.\n\nThe NDAA also eases the transfer of advanced technology and information sharing between the three countries. But Courtney, who has played a big role in shepherding AUKUS through Congress, said there is \"not a complete carveout\" for exemptions for the two countries as it relates to the U.S. rules around restrictions and export control of defense-related technologies known as ITAR.\n\nIn order for Congress to approve the NDAA authorizations, lawmakers still need to pass fiscal year 2024 spending bills. Those appropriations bills face tough votes early next year and need to pass before mid-January and early February deadlines to avoid a government shutdown.\n\nPlus, Congress has yet to approve Biden's national security supplemental package on aid for Ukraine, Israel, humanitarian aid for Gaza and the Indo-Pacific region. The administration wants to achieve the latter by improving the U.S. Navy's public shipyards as well as supporting a wide range of needs for the industry. Biden has requested about $3.4 billion in additional funding for the submarine industrial base.\n\nThe emergency funding has been held up as Republicans condition Ukraine funding on passing measures that could place some limits on immigration. Murphy is currently involved in talks with GOP members to see if a border deal can be reached to unlock Ukraine aid, but they are facing time constraints and some bipartisan pushback.\n\n\"The issue of the supplemental request that came over from the White House and the Navy is something that is very important to make AUKUS a success, because it's all tied to increasing industrial base capacity,\" Courtney said.\n\n\"Capacity is the name of the game,\" he added. \"I'm personally hoping the Senate is going to find the Da Vinci code to get that supplemental to move forward and get it over to the House.\"",

        "title": "HKTDC Export Index 4Q23: 4-6% expected growth for Hong Kong exports in 2024",
        "body": "Hong Kong exports are expected to grow by 4% to 6% next year - a sharp contrast to the 11% decline in the city's export levels recorded for the period between January and October this year.\n\nThis optimistic outlook is driven by the significant increase in demand for electronic components, partly on account of growing demand for AI-enabled devices and other finished products, which play a crucial role in boosting the city's prospects.\n\nCommenting on the likely upturn in Hong Kong's export performance, Hong Kong Trade Development Council (HKTDC) Director of Research Ms Irina Fan said: \"The unique properties of Hong Kong's electronics-orientated export economy make it almost ideally positioned to take full advantage of the imminent rebound in demand for high-tech components.\"\n\nThe Hong Kong Export Outlook forms part of the review of the city's export prospects conducted annually by HKTDC Research. This wide-ranging review takes into account a wide array of factors, including many key global, regional and local economic indicators.\n\nLight at the end of the tunnel\n\nDespite many of the factors restraining Hong Kong's 2023 export growth likely to remain in place next year, HKTDC Research's confidence is based on the widespread acknowledgment that the electronics sector - which accounts for 70% of all of Hong Kong's exports - is expected to enjoy rapid growth in 2024, partly on account of growing consumer and business demand for AI-enabled PCs.\n\n\"Demand in this sector is certain to bolster the local economy overall, ensuring that Hong Kong's wide exporter base will be fully ready and adequately resourced to take advantage of wider global economic recovery, which is expected to come to fruition over the course of 2025,\" she added.\n\nContinuously softened sentiment in the near-term\n\nExport growth is set to come after continuously softened export sentiment this year. The HKTDC Export Index contracted 5.5 points to 35 in the fourth quarter of 2023, indicating Hong Kong exporters have become more cautious amid rising geopolitical tensions, in particular the Israel-Gaza conflict, and sluggish external demand.\n\nExporter sentiment has declined across four of the six major industry sectors. Machinery at 40.3 (up 0.9 points) was one of the better-performing sectors, followed by electronics at 34.8 (down 6.0 points). Less optimistically, toys suffered the most substantial decline, falling 12.8 points to 29.4.\n\nBased on a quarterly HKTDC survey of 500 exporters from six major industries - clothing, electronics, jewellery, machinery, timepieces and toys - the index above 50 indicates an optimistic outlook and below 50 pessimistic.\n\nIndia, Taiwan and Mainland China markets promising\n\nSentiment in all key export markets remains below 50. However, sentiment towards India (42.7, up 10.1 points) is the most positive, followed by Taiwan (42.5, up 4.8 points) and Mainland China (39.5, up 0.9 points). Meanwhile, exporters were less confident, when it came to their export prospects to the EU (34.6, down 2.6 points) and the US (33.6, down 2.8 points).\n\nEconomic risks and geopolitical tensions concerns\n\nLooking ahead, economic risks remain the top concern for 2024. The majority (84.7%) of respondents saw economic slowdowns or recession risks in overseas markets as the major challenge, followed by ongoing geopolitical tensions (62.5%) and rising transport costs / disruption to logistics and distribution obstructions (41.8%).\n\nEnsuring sufficient cash flow clearly stands out as the focus for next year, with over half of the exporters intending to adopt cash flow management, significantly more than in the last survey in the third quarter this year (32%). More exporters also aim to maintain competitiveness by providing a wider range of value-added services (44.5%) and increasing marketing and promotional activities (41.2%).\n\nHKTDC Research Principal Economist Mr Wing Chu said in addition to the common strategy of cash flow management, different industries favour various approaches. \"For example, businesses in the electronics, timepieces and machinery sectors are keen to increase marketing, promotion or business matching in the coming year. Those in jewellery and clothing sectors, meanwhile, are more inclined to prioritise the use of e-commerce to drive sales growth,\" he added.\n\nSource: HKTDC",

        "title": "India's economy in 2024: A stable growth path is now within sight",
        "body": "The year 2023 is ending on a positive note for the Indian economy. GDP growth in the second quarter of 2023-24 came in much better than market expectations at 7.6%, led by a strong rebound in the manufacturing sector, even while services-sector growth remained healthy. Investment saw a strong rebound led by increased capex by the Centre and state governments. High-frequency economic indicators like GST collections, core sector growth, car sales and passenger traffic are also reflecting healthy economic growth. Inflation has been on a downward trajectory, with consumer price index (CPI) inflation close to 5%. The corporate sector is also in good shape, as reflected by our credit ratio of 1.67 (number of upgrades to downgrades) in the first half of 2023-24, which is better than the long-term average of 1.5. The critical question for 2024 is whether India's growth momentum will be sustained. Let's take a closer look:\n\nGlobal uncertainties to linger: The new year will continue to see a weakness in overall global growth. The IMF expects global GDP growth to slow to 2.9% in 2024, slightly lower than its 2023 estimate. Some major economies like the US and EU will feel the bite of interest rates staying higher for longer, as indicated by their central banks. This will keep India's merchandise exports muted in 2024, as has been the case this year. While services exports are likely to remain healthy, note that their growth has been decelerating; it has moderated to an average of 5.5% in the last three months, as against an average 24% seen in the first three months of the year.\n\nIncreased geo-political rifts: Even as the Russia-Ukraine war lingered, the global economy was hit by this year's Israel-Hamas war. Geo-political concerns are likely to continue in 2024 and any worsening of geo-political rifts will pose risks for commodity prices. But with China's economy likely to remain weak, demand-side pressure on these prices will be weak. Climate related risks and their impact on the prices of agricultural commodities are another factor that we need to watch out for.\n\nExpect strong urban consumption but rural demand may remain shaky: India has been seeing strong consumption demand in urban zones, as reflected by robust passenger car sales, a surge in travel and tourism and bustling retail sales. However, rural demand has been muted, as also indicated by FMCG offtake. This year's skewed monsoon could jeopardize the rural demand recovery. As per first advance estimates, kharif crop production is lower by 4.6% year-on-year in 2023 and rabi season sowing has also been adversely impacted. Hence, we may see high food inflation linger, which would dampen rural demand further.\n\nHigh consumer borrowing to continue: India has been seeing a sharp increase in personal loans. The Reserve Bank of India (RBI) on a cautious note has introduced stiffer capital requirements for banks and NBFCs in the context of their exposure to unsecured personal loans. While this may somewhat moderate their growth, the overall trend of high personal loan growth is likely to continue. This appears to be a structural change in the economy -- in line with high aspirations among the youth and their growing consumption. This trend will also be supported by digitization trends across the Indian economy.\n\nPrivate investment is likely to pick up gradually: The moot question now is whether private investment will pick up meaningfully in 2024. The order books of capital goods companies have been filling up. From a representative sample of five such firms, we find that order books have grown by 15% in this fiscal year's first half, as against compound annual growth of around 5% in the previous four years. This could indicate a pick-up in capex going forward. There is concern that private investors may be wary of policy uncertainty as general elections are due in 2024, as reflected by a sharp drop in private investments announced in the second quarter of this fiscal year (as per CMIE). Decisive mandates in all five state polls held recently would give investors confidence.\n\nRBI could move towards easing monetary policy: In the near-term, RBI is likely to remain cautious, given high food inflation. However, it could consider rate cuts from the second quarter of 2024-25, as CPI inflation moves closer to its 4% target. However, it is likely to be a shallow rate-cut cycle.\n\nChina plus one benefits: With a wider chasm between the US and China, India was expected to benefit from 'China plus one' corporate strategies. While some investments and trade have come in, the effect so far has been modest. US imports from India rose by $31 billion between 2018 and 2022, while those from Vietnam rose by $78 billion. A big change on this front in 2024 is unlikely, but over time, India is likely to benefit, given the high levels of interest shown by global players in 'Make in India.'\n\nIndia is entering 2024 on a confident note with high growth and moderating inflation. There are uncertainties and lingering concerns around the volatile global environment, weak domestic rural demand and a slow pick-up in private investment. But overall, the mood is optimistic. As our economy moves to a more stable growth path, our focus should move to growth that's more broad-based and inclusive.\n\nSource: Livemint",

        "body": "\"For I have come down from heaven, not to do My own will, but the will of Him who sent Me.\" (John 6:38 nkjv)\n\nOn Christmas Eve, 1968, three astronauts became the first humans to view the Earth from space. Frank Borman, Jim Lovell, and William Anders, the crew of Apollo 8, spent the night before Christmas orbiting the moon and broadcasting all the glorious images they were witnessing for the first time. In one of the most-watched television events in history, the space travelers read the creation story from Genesis, chapter one, ending with the famous line, \"Merry Christmas, and God bless all of you, all of you on the good Earth.\" America's top newsman Walter Cronkite later said, \"It was an event beyond all other events.\"\n\nMan's travel from Earth to space was certainly a monumental event in history, but it doesn't compare to the moment in time when God traveled from heaven to Earth to be born as a baby. On that holy night of Incarnation, the divine Son of God put on flesh and blood, becoming fully human. Words can't possibly communicate the tremendous sacrifice Jesus made to become Emmanuel, God with us. We'll never fully comprehend the mystery of His transformation from God to man. Oh, what a Savior!\n\nSeven hundred years before the birth of Jesus, the prophet Micah prophesied where the Messiah would be born: \"But you, Bethlehem Ephrathah, though you are little among the thousands of Judah, yet out of you shall come forth to Me the One to be Ruler in Israel, whose goings forth are from of old, from everlasting.\" (Micah 5:2)\n\nJesus came to Earth to show us what God is like. But why did His story begin in Bethlehem? His GPS location when He came to Earth revealed something about the character of God. Jesus didn't come riding on the clouds on a white horse surrounded by myriads of angels, nor did He come to be king over the most powerful empire in the world, and to sit on a golden throne in a grand palace. No, He came to a stable in the tiny town of Bethlehem as a powerless, needy baby -- what humility! He came to bring justice to the oppressed and to set the captives free.\n\nBefore Christ, men and women religiously obeyed God's law, more out of fear than out of love. \"Jehovah\" was a distant God to be worshipped through rituals, not like the God that Adam and Eve once walked and talked with in the cool of the day. But on that holy night in Bethlehem, God sent His indescribable gift, His only Son. Because Jesus came to Earth, we no longer have to wonder what God is really like. He became one of us, faced the same temptations, and lived a sinless life. What an example for us! And such great expectations He has for us! He has shown you, O man, what is good; and what does the Lord require of you but to do justly, to love mercy, and to walk humbly with your God? (Micah 6:8)\n\nThis Christmas, let's ask God to help us be more like Him -- to be humble lovers of mercy and doers of justice. And let's thank Jesus for His sacrifice of leaving the glories and riches of heaven to come to Earth. His magnificent incarnation will forever be the event that's far beyond all other events!\n\n~\n\nScripture is quoted from the New King James Version. Copyright © 1982 by Thomas Nelson.

        "body": "Chicago, Dec. 14, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- According to a research report \"Global Cybersecurity Industry Outlook 2024: A Look Ahead at the Cyber Landscape\" published by MarketsandMarkets, the global cybersecurity industry market size is estimated to grow from USD 190.5 billion in 2023 to USD 208.8 billion by 2024, at a Y-o-Y increase of ~10%. Companies like Palo Alto Networks, Fortinet, Cisco, Checkpoint, etc., have contributed to this growth through innovation, diverse product offerings, and effective marketing strategies.\n\nThe global cybersecurity landscape is poised for an evolution marked by unprecedented challenges and unparalleled opportunities. As we steer into 2024, the dynamics of digital security continue to shape industries, governments, and individuals. Our comprehensive outlook explores the trends, innovations, and pivotal shifts defining the cybersecurity industry in the coming year.\n\nTop Key Companies in Cybersecurity Industry Outlook\n\nPalo Alto Networks (US), IBM (US), Microsoft (US), Cisco (US), Broadcom (US), Fortinet (US), AWS (US), Trellix (US), Check Point (Israel), Oracle (US), Trend Micro (Japan), Open Text (Canada), Akamai (US), and Accenture (Ireland) have significantly contributed to ~25% market share in 2022 and were highly competitive with focus on partnership strategies. Throughout 2023, vendors shifted their emphasis toward product innovation and the integration of artificial intelligence. As we progress into 2024, security vendors are positioned to spearhead innovation, reinforcing defensive measures and introducing initiatives that signal a resilient era of protection, proactive strategies, and resilience against continually evolving threats.\n\nInquire Before Buying @ https://www.marketsandmarkets.com/Enquiry_Before_BuyingNew.asp?id=217338166\n\n2023 was the year of Generative AI (GenAI) entry into the world of cybersecurity, as two-thirds of tech companies are already eyeing it. The menace created by deep fakes, the increasing ransomware-based data extortion, and the changing regional malware landscape were the highlights of 2023 developments. The report predicts the increasing trend of XDR solution adoption in IT-OT environments, the government's efforts to combat the threat of deep fakes, CISO strategies for enhancing cyber resilience, and the transition to password-free and perimeter-less security are going to impact the cybersecurity market in the coming year, i.e., 2024. We believe this report will assist security professionals in being ready for both the known and unknowns of the upcoming year.\n\nThe MarketsandMarkets - Global Cybersecurity Industry Outlook 2024 report can help prepare security professionals and business leaders for the year ahead. The report incorporates years of experience in the rapidly expanding cybersecurity sector, the opinions of industry experts, comprehensive evaluations by analysts, and extensive interviews with stakeholder groups worldwide.\n\nThe regional cybersecurity market varies significantly and is shaped by unique regulations, threat landscapes, and technological advancements. North America emphasizes innovation and compliance, while Europe prioritizes privacy-centric solutions due to stringent data protection laws, as the continent faces being the most targeted region for cyber-attacks by 2024. At the same time, Asia Pacific, with increased investments in small and medium-sized enterprises, focuses on scalable cybersecurity tools for diverse business needs. In 2023, the Asia Pacific and European regions will see the highest Y-o-Y increase in ransomware attacks per organization, estimated to be 29% and 24%, respectively. The North American region follows with a 15% Y-o-Y increase from 2022. We forecast that Europe will surpass the U.S. to become the most targeted region in 2024.",

        "title": "Menorah Lighting Rejected from Art and Music Festival",
        "body": "Recently a Virginia rabbi's request to perform a menorah lighting at a local art and music festival was denied.\n\nDespite being in the middle of the Hanukkah season, the rabbi's request was denied, according to Fox News, because the festival organization \"does not permit religious celebrations.\" However, this claim is largely different than the response that Rabbi Mendy Heber received in a private text message from the event organizer.\n\n\"Unless we could get an Islamic group to participate at the same. We are about Peace, Love & light...don't want to make it seem we're choosing a side -- supporting the killing/bombing of thousands of men, women & children,\" the text message read.\n\nThis text clearly implied that the menorah lighting was considered to be a sign of support with Israel, which the event organizers did not want to show. However, Heber claimed that a proposed idea from the festival demonstrated a clear choosing of a side.\n\nGet your FREE CHARISMA NEWSLETTERS today! Stay up to date with current issues, Holy Spirit news, Christian teachings, Charisma videos & more!\n\n\"They came back to us and said, 'Hey, we would be ready with the proposal if we would have a cease-fire banner under the menorah,' clearly taking a political side and welcoming the menorah under certain circumstances,\" Heber said.\n\nIn a separate statement, the event founder, Shirley Vermillion said, \"In 14 years this street festival has never had a religious program as one of its events. This is not a discriminatory act but one based on the objectives of the organization and the sincere desire to make this monthly event a place where all people can come together to enjoy music and art.\"\n\nThere seems to be a discrepancy between the public reasoning against the menorah lighting and the private reasoning given to Heber as to why the lighting could not take place. Not showing support for American Jews because of something happening in another country seems harsh, regardless of the thought behind it.\n\nAs Christians, we must remember to never back down from having a heart for the Jewish people, the lineage in which our Savior descended from. When God first called Abram to make a great nation out of him, He said: \"I will bless them who bless you and curse him who curses you, and in you all families of the earth will be blessed,\" (Gen. 12:3). Because God's Word is never void and never fails, His Word and His promise to the Jewish people today still holds true, now and forever.\n\nJoin Charisma Magazine Online to follow everything the Holy Spirit is doing around the world!\n\nAbby Trivett is a marketing copywriter and coordinator for Charisma Media.\n\nTo contact us or to submit an article, click here.\n\nGet Charisma's best content delivered right to your inbox!

The second is transparency, which is a big key. Is the organization transparent in their processes and their reporting? Do they have an active and quality board?\n\n\"The third is sustainability. Does the organization have multiple funding streams? Do they have a plan that is reasonable,\" O'Quinn said during the program.\n\n\"We want to make sure the organizations are sustainable, transparent and entities that can actually benefit and grow from the support of our foundations. Today you got to see 49 organizations that fit that bill,\" O'Quinn said following the program.\n\nThe boards of the foundations decided to present funds to public safety entities, including local law enforcement, medical and fire services.\n\n\"They decided to support public safety entities that take care of the greater Bristol, Washington County area and show their appreciation for all the hard work those agencies do,\" he said.\n\nAmong the recipients, Lisa Cofer, executive director of the United Way of Bristol, fought back tears when asked about the importance of the funding that agency received.\n\n\"It's hard to put into words, to see all the organizations come together, the foundations and Jim and Fran, their boards how they value the boots on the ground,\" Cofer said. \"This gives us additional resources to be able to do that work.

        "title": "Oreo unveils new flavor inspired by a Jewish New York bakery classic - Jewish Telegraphic Agency",
        "body": "(New York Jewish Week) -- Some happy news for fans of Jewish desserts: Classic cookie company Oreo has unveiled three new flavors for the new year, and among them is a tribute to black and white cookies, a Jewish New York staple.\n\nThe limited-edition Oreo Black & White Cookies, which will be available starting Jan. 4, features Golden Oreo cookies with a creme filling that's half chocolate and half vanilla-flavored.\n\nNow, you may be asking yourself: Aren't regular Oreo cookies already black and white? And yes, yes, they are. But this particular limited-time treat honors the half-moon appearance of the OG black and white cookies, with the chocolate and vanilla filling split right down the middle. (Plus, as an astute colleague pointed out: True New York black and white cookies are made with a thick, yellow cake-like cookie base, therefore more similar to a Golden Oreo than a regular.)\n\nTraditional black and white cookies, which are widely available at New York City delis, bagel shops and bakeries, are commonly considered to be a Jewish dessert. \"Seinfeld\" once dedicated an episode, \"The Dinner Party,\" to singing their praises.\n\nSign up for our newsletter to get must-read New York stories each day\n\nI accept the JTA Privacy Policy.\n\nPlease accept the JTA Privacy Policy\n\nBy submitting the above I agree to the privacy policy and terms of use of JTA.org\n\n\"You see, Elaine, the key to eating a black and white cookie is that you wanna get some black and some white in each bite,\" Jerry says. \"Nothing mixes better than vanilla and chocolate. And yet still somehow racial harmony eludes us. If people would only look to the cookie, all our problems would be solved.\"\n\nThe history of black and white cookies is a complicated one, but the treats as we know them are said to have been popularized by Glaser's Bake Shop on the Upper East Side, which was founded in 1902 by John Herbert Glaser. Glaser reportedly brought the black and white recipe with him when he immigrated to the United States from Germany.\n\nIn recent years, Jewish bakers have riffed on the cookies' theme, creating \"black and whites\" that are actually yellow and blue to support Ukraine, red to celebrate Valentine's Day, or blue and white to honor Israel.\n\n\"We've been making the black and white cookie for 95 years,\" Brian Zaro told the New York Jewish Week last year, when his family-owned Zaro's bakery unveiled a host of new flavors such as carrot cake and cookies-and-cream (in other words, yes: an Oreo-flavored black and white cookie). \"My brother, Scott, had a vision to make an iconic item that meets innovation.\"\n\nIn a similar vein, in the never-ending quest for new customers, many national snack brands have innovated, too, unveiling unique, Jewish-inspired flavors. Most recently, Pringles released an everything bagel-flavored potato chip, while back in 2015 Lay's produced a much-loved limited-edition New York Reuben flavor.\n\nThough Oreos may be one of the most popular cookies in the United States today -- generating more than $675 million in revenue each year -- the creme-filled chocolate sandwich cookies are actually a copycat of Hydrox cookies, which were first released in 1908, four years before Oreos appeared on grocery store shelves.\n\nOreo quickly emerged a favorite among American consumers, but for decades Hydrox kept at least one market cornered: observant Jews. That's because, as JTA's Ben Sales wrote in 2018, \"until a glorious day in 1998, Hydrox was the premier kosher sandwich cookie on the market, while Oreos remained 'treif,' lacking a kosher heksher, or seal of approval.\" Since 1997, the Orthodox Union has certified Oreos as kosher, with 43 varieties currently making its list.\n\nThe other new, permanent flavors that Oreo is unveiling in January are Gluten-Free Golden Oreos and Oreo Peanut Butter Cakesters, a \"soft-baked snack\" with peanut butter-flavored filling, as per a press release. Perhaps we Jewish cookie-lovers can hope for kichel-, biscochos- or hamantashen-inspired Oreos in 2025.\n\nSupport the New York Jewish Week\n\nOur nonprofit newsroom depends on readers like you.

Here's how to watch\n\nWASHINGTON -- The massive annual defense policy package cleared Congress ahead of the holiday recess, despite protests about attaching a foreign surveillance extension and criticism that the bill did not block a Pentagon abortion policy.\n\nU.S. House lawmakers approved the package on Thursday 310-118, under a suspension of the chamber's rules, meaning a two-thirds majority was required.\n\nA bloc of the most far-right representatives voted against the legislation, as did members of the House's most progressive wing. Nebraska Reps. Adrian Smith, Don Bacon and Mike Flood, all Republicans, voted for passage.\n\nIf signed into law, which is expected, the roughly $884 billion legislation would authorize a 5.2% pay raise for troops, approve a nuclear submarine program for the Indo-Pacific region and carry the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, also known as FISA, until mid-April.\n\nThe National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, for fiscal year 2024 authorizes the dollar amounts that will be dedicated to continuing military and nuclear operations but does not directly provide the funds. Congress has yet to pass its annual funding bills.\n\nDirect funding for Ukraine's war effort is also knotted up in congressional infighting over immigration policy. The NDAA would direct $300 million to Ukraine in security assistance as well as support programs for Ukrainian troops suffering post-traumatic stress disorders and brain injuries.\n\nBipartisan Senate passage\n\nThe U.S. Senate passed the legislation in a bipartisan 87-13 vote Wednesday night. Nebraska Sens. Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts, both Republicans, both voted for passage.\n\n\"I am pleased that the Senate has come together to once again pass a strong, bipartisan defense bill. This is a dangerous moment in the world, and the NDAA makes critical progress toward meeting the threats we face,\" Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who chairs the Senate Committee on Armed Services, said in a statement late Wednesday.\n\nSen. Roger Wicker, the committee's ranking member, said the bill \"should signal to China, Russia, and others that we will not accept a world where America does not have the best fighting force.\"\n\n\"While I would have preferred to send the President a substantially larger proposed investment in our industrial base, he now should approve the monumental investments Congress intends to make in our servicemembers, warships, submarines, aircraft, and technology,\" the Mississippi Republican said in a statement after the vote.\n\nThe vote followed a failed attempt by GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky to block a controversial decision to use the defense package as a vehicle to temporarily extend FISA, which would have expired Dec. 31.\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle oppose the surveillance law's ability to scoop up communications by U.S. citizens while spying on foreign targets.\n\n'Best shipbuilders in the world'\n\nSeveral senators praised the bill for economic activity that will be brought to their states.\n\nSen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania said $300 million was authorized for his state's defense-related workforce and activities.\n\nNebraska senators\n\nSen. Deb Fischer, a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement after the vote: \"The first responsibility of the federal government is the safety and security of this nation. As the United States faces growing threats from China, Russia, and Iran, it's vital that Congress act to equip our military to protect the American people. This year's NDAA secures a pay raise for our troops and supports key defense priorities across the country, including at Offutt Air Force Base. Our bipartisan legislation will also update our aging nuclear forces, boost domestic munitions production, and bolster our national security.\"\n\nThe bill includes two amendments sponsored by Sens. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., and James Lankford, R-Okla. One measure bolsters the amount of information passport applicants can get online about their passport status. The other adds an option to chat online about passport problems with a customer service agent at the National Passport Information Center.\n\n\"Pennsylvania's military installations and defense industry continue to play a key role in supporting allies like Taiwan, Ukraine, and Israel against attacks on democracy abroad,\" Fetterman, a Democrat, said in a statement Thursday morning.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine of Virginia also issued a morning statement lauding the legislation's support of Virginia's defense and shipbuilding industries.\n\n\"The legislation also bolsters our alliances, as it includes my bipartisan bill to prevent any U.S. President from withdrawing from NATO, as well as provisions I secured to support the Australia-U.K-U.S. (AUKUS) agreement.\n\n\"Our NATO and AUKUS alliances are critical to our national security and economic growth in Hampton Roads, which is home to the only operational NATO command in the U.S. and the best shipbuilders in the world,\" the Virginia Democrat said, referring to an area in Virginia with a large military presence, including Langley Air Force Base and the Norfolk Naval Shipyard.\n\nSenate Republican Whip John Thune of South Dakota on the floor Tuesday applauded the bill's funding authorization for the B-21 bomber program, which will be located in his state at Ellsworth Air Force Base.\n\nSenators who opposed the bill included New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker, Indiana Republican Mike Braun, Missouri Republican Josh Hawley, Utah Republican Mike Lee, Wyoming Republican Cynthia Lummis, Massachusetts Democrats Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren, Oregon Democrats Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden, Kentucky's Rand Paul, Vermont independent Bernie Sanders, Ohio Republican J.D. Vance and Vermont Democrat Peter Welch.\n\nHawley vehemently opposed the legislation after his amendment to compensate those exposed to residual radioactive waste from the Manhattan Project was removed from the final bill.\n\nHawley's original amendment, which passed the Senate in July to be attached to the NDAA, would have opened the compensation program for St. Louis, Missouri residents and to those living in Colorado, Idaho, Guam, Montana and New Mexico, as well as expanded coverage areas in Arizona, Nevada and Utah.\n\nFar-right opposition\n\nWhile the bill followed a relatively smooth path among senators, the defense policy legislation hit opposition in the GOP-led House, where far-right lawmakers maintain their priorities were stripped from the compromise legislation.\n\n\"With this NDAA conference report, you almost feel like a parent who's sent a child off to summer camp and they've come back a monster,\" GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida said on the floor Thursday morning.\n\nGaetz was among the no votes.\n\nHouse Freedom Caucus members accused the bill's negotiators of secretive, non-inclusive negotiations during which their amendments to block a Department of Defense abortion policy, ban certain transgender care for troops and completely eliminate any Pentagon diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs were nixed.\n\n\"The Swamp's 'compromise' NDAA allows the DOD to use your tax dollars to fund abortion travel for servicemembers. As a proud pro-life conservative, I'll be voting NO,\" Rep. Andrew Clyde of Georgia posted Tuesday night on X after the Senate voted to advance the bill.\n\nGOP Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina wrote on social media Wednesday that \"The Backroom NDAA is a disaster for conservatives in so many ways.\"\n\nThe Pentagon's abortion policy gives time off and travel reimbursement for service members who seek abortions in states where it remains legal. The policy, instated after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, fueled Alabama GOP Sen. Tommy Tuberville's monthslong freeze on military promotions.\n\nClyde and Norman both opposed the NDAA Thursday morning, along with outgoing House Freedom Caucus Chair Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania.\n\nSome members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus who voted no included its chair Pramila Jayapal of Washington, deputy chair Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Maxwell Frost of Florida, Cori Bush of Missouri, Summer Lee of Pennsylvania, Mark Pocan of Wisconsin and retiring Earl Blumenauer of Oregon.\n\nPolicies on flags, DEI hiring remain\n\nWhile some far-right House amendments are not in the final text, other conservative priorities remained, including a measure to prohibit, with some conditions negotiated by the Senate, the display of unapproved flags. Democrats protested the original language as a ban on LBGTQ+ flags.\n\nDespite throwing out the amendment to eliminate all DEI programs and positions, negotiators landed on a hiring freeze and pay grade cap for employees on the initiatives.\n\nThe Senate receded during negotiations and also allowed a House-led amendment to remain that bans any funding for critical race theory at military service academies and during training.\n\nNegotiators also kept a familiar conservative priority of codifying the rights of parents to review school curricula. The guarantee, usually already available to school parents, will now be codified in the NDAA for parents of schoolchildren enrolled in Department of Defense Education Activity programs.\n\nThe legislation heads to President Joe Biden's desk. The administration had called on Congress for the bill's \"swift passage.\"\n\nCongress has passed the NDAA for 63 consecutive years. The annual defense policy package typically draws bipartisan support.\n\nThe post Shipbuilding, bombers, military pay raise: Congress sends massive defense bill to Biden appeared first on Nebraska Examiner.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Wire Dcc States-newsroom Tncen D.c.

While progress has been made, negotiators warn that difficult issues still remain to be resolved and that reaching a bipartisan Senate agreement does not guarantee the deal could also pass the House. There is pressure to finalize an agreement soon as Congress plans to break for recess at the end of the week.",

        "body": "HANCOCK COUNTY -- Two vehicles filled with over 1,400 different cleaning items along with new pillows, blankets, shower curtains, batteries and more backed into the Hancock Hope House parking lot for delivery of the new items.\n\n\"Look at my little elves,\" Teresa Brooks, a Hope House Shelter support member, said. \"This -- it just warms my heart to see this type of giving during the holiday season.\"\n\nFour students from New Palestine High School (NPHS), along with one of their teachers, Mitch Burk, dropped off hundreds of new items earlier this week to finish up a school \"Giving Trees\" project, spearheaded by seniors Sydney Oliver and Audra Bloomer.\n\n\"It was really cool to be a part of all this because I've never been a part of something so big where you're helping other people so much,\" Oliver said. \"We're really pleased with how the project turned out as we ended up getting way more than we expected.\"\n\nTheir project, which the whole Southern Hancock Community School Corporation took part in, was part of NPHS teacher Jeremy Large's Serving Learning Class where students get credit for learning about how to best serve their community.\n\nBurk, who also coordinates the NPHS Annual Class Cup Challenge, where each class earns points for good deeds, helped the two NPHS seniors out with the community \"Giving Trees\" project. He and the students made sure there were \"Giving Trees\" set up at five Southern Hancock schools and two businesses around the town of New Palestine. The different locations helped the girls more than double last year's donations.\n\n\"Last year we brought about 600 items, and this year we've got over 1,400,\" said Burk, who was dressed in a Santa Claus coat said.\n\nBurk noted as he and the students unloaded the items from inside the two vehicles into large red bins to be brought into the Hope House at 35 E. Pierson Street, Greenfield, he and school officials were proud of the two girls who were in charge of the project. He also stated their helpers, other students in the Service Learning class and throughout the district, were fantastic when it came to thinking about giving to others.\n\n\"The students who do this project every year really take ownership with getting it coordinated and expanding it and communicating,\" Burk said. \"We're equally proud of the Southern Hancock community where we had so many parents get in contact with us to see exactly what the shelter and retail store needed.\"\n\nKaren Newell is the program coordinator at the Hancock Hope House and said the Southern Hancock school district is one of their biggest supporters. The nonprofit supports up to 40 people at the shelter at any given time as well as supplies the retail store where residents and others in the community can come in a shop for gently used or new items.\n\n\"This is such a big deal for us,\" Newell said. \"Quite a bit of what we do here at the Hope House runs off of donations, including giving all of our residents essential hygiene items when they come here.\"\n\nSomething as simple as providing a family with a bottle of laundry soap goes a long way at the Hope House, Newell said. She noted while the need is large all year long, things become particularly tough for the residents at the Hope House and for those who shop in the thrift store during the holidays.\n\n\"Any home, not just people struggling with homelessness, can be strapped having to worry about by expensive laundry detergent,\" Newell said. \"We know that and we're here to help.\"\n\nThose who work and volunteer at the Hope House say they have a great relationship with officials in the Southern Hancock school district who are more than happy to take the time and help the Hope House reach their donation goals.\n\n\"This is not the first time that school district has done things for us, and we're so very grateful,\" Newell said. \"I look at these kids as someday being our future supporters and maybe evening volunteering to work here some day.\"\n\nOfficials with the Hope House gave those in charge of the \"Giving Trees\" project a list of the items the Hope House will take in and noted, anyone who wants to donate can find a list of things they need on the Hope House social media site pages.\n\nIn the meantime, Burk and fellow educators at NPHS are already thinking about how the district can help serve the whole county community next year and have plans to grow the project beyond giving donations just to the Hope House.\n\n\"Next year, we plan to still do the \"Giving Trees\" but maybe let each different school pick one nonprofit or county place they'd like to help, like the soup kitchen or the animal shelter,\" Burk said.\n\nBurk has also thought about trying to coordinate a giving contest with other county school districts during the holidays as he knows they all participate in giving during the Christmas season as well.\n\n\"That's what we like about this project is we're not trying to reinvent the wheel but maybe refocus that giving spirit we know this county has,\" Burk said.",

Nebraska Reps. Adrian Smith, Don Bacon and Mike Flood, all Republicans, voted for passage.\n\nIf signed into law, which is expected, the roughly $884 billion legislation would authorize a 5.2% pay raise for troops, approve a nuclear submarine program for the Indo-Pacific region and carry the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, also known as FISA, until mid-April.\n\nThe National Defense Authorization Act, or NDAA, for fiscal year 2024 authorizes the dollar amounts that will be dedicated to continuing military and nuclear operations but does not directly provide the funds. Congress has yet to pass its annual funding bills.\n\nDirect funding for Ukraine's war effort is also knotted up in congressional infighting over immigration policy. The NDAA would direct $300 million to Ukraine in security assistance as well as support programs for Ukrainian troops suffering post-traumatic stress disorders and brain injuries.\n\nBipartisan Senate passage\n\nThe U.S. Senate passed the legislation in a bipartisan 87-13 vote Wednesday night. Nebraska Sens. Deb Fischer and Pete Ricketts, both Republicans, both voted for passage.\n\n\"I am pleased that the Senate has come together to once again pass a strong, bipartisan defense bill. This is a dangerous moment in the world, and the NDAA makes critical progress toward meeting the threats we face,\" Sen. Jack Reed, a Rhode Island Democrat who chairs the Senate Committee on Armed Services, said in a statement late Wednesday.\n\nSen. Roger Wicker, the committee's ranking member, said the bill \"should signal to China, Russia, and others that we will not accept a world where America does not have the best fighting force.\"\n\n\"While I would have preferred to send the President a substantially larger proposed investment in our industrial base, he now should approve the monumental investments Congress intends to make in our servicemembers, warships, submarines, aircraft, and technology,\" the Mississippi Republican said in a statement after the vote.\n\nThe vote followed a failed attempt by GOP Sen. Rand Paul of Kentucky to block a controversial decision to use the defense package as a vehicle to temporarily extend FISA, which would have expired Dec. 31.\n\nLawmakers on both sides of the aisle oppose the surveillance law's ability to scoop up communications by U.S. citizens while spying on foreign targets.\n\n'Best shipbuilders in the world'\n\nSeveral senators praised the bill for economic activity that will be brought to their states.\n\nSen. John Fetterman of Pennsylvania said $300 million was authorized for his state's defense-related workforce and activities.\n\nNebraska senators\n\nSen. Deb Fischer, a senior member of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said in a statement after the vote: \"The first responsibility of the federal government is the safety and security of this nation. As the United States faces growing threats from China, Russia, and Iran, it's vital that Congress act to equip our military to protect the American people. This year's NDAA secures a pay raise for our troops and supports key defense priorities across the country, including at Offutt Air Force Base. Our bipartisan legislation will also update our aging nuclear forces, boost domestic munitions production, and bolster our national security.\"\n\nThe bill includes two amendments sponsored by Sens. Pete Ricketts, R-Neb., and James Lankford, R-Okla. One measure bolsters the amount of information passport applicants can get online about their passport status. The other adds an option to chat online about passport problems with a customer service agent at the National Passport Information Center.\n\n\"Pennsylvania's military installations and defense industry continue to play a key role in supporting allies like Taiwan, Ukraine, and Israel against attacks on democracy abroad,\" Fetterman, a Democrat, said in a statement Thursday morning.\n\nSen. Tim Kaine of Virginia also issued a morning statement lauding the legislation's support of Virginia's defense and shipbuilding industries.\n\n\"The legislation also bolsters our alliances, as it includes my bipartisan bill to prevent any U.S. President from withdrawing from NATO, as well as provisions I secured to support the Australia-U.K-U.S. (AUKUS) agreement.\n\n\"Our NATO and AUKUS alliances are critical to our national security and economic growth in Hampton Roads, which is home to the only operational NATO command in the U.S. and the best shipbuilders in the world,\" the Virginia Democrat said, referring to an area in Virginia with a large military presence, including Langley Air Force Base and the Norfolk Naval Shipyard.\n\nSenate Republican Whip John Thune of South Dakota on the floor Tuesday applauded the bill's funding authorization for the B-21 bomber program, which will be located in his state at Ellsworth Air Force Base.\n\nSenators who opposed the bill included New Jersey Democrat Cory Booker, Indiana Republican Mike Braun, Missouri Republican Josh Hawley, Utah Republican Mike Lee, Wyoming Republican Cynthia Lummis, Massachusetts Democrats Ed Markey and Elizabeth Warren, Oregon Democrats Jeff Merkley and Ron Wyden, Kentucky's Rand Paul, Vermont independent Bernie Sanders, Ohio Republican J.D. Vance and Vermont Democrat Peter Welch.\n\nHawley vehemently opposed the legislation after his amendment to compensate those exposed to residual radioactive waste from the Manhattan Project was removed from the final bill.\n\nHawley's original amendment, which passed the Senate in July to be attached to the NDAA, would have opened the compensation program for St. Louis, Missouri residents and to those living in Colorado, Idaho, Guam, Montana and New Mexico, as well as expanded coverage areas in Arizona, Nevada and Utah.\n\nFar-right opposition\n\nWhile the bill followed a relatively smooth path among senators, the defense policy legislation hit opposition in the GOP-led House, where far-right lawmakers maintain their priorities were stripped from the compromise legislation.\n\n\"With this NDAA conference report, you almost feel like a parent who's sent a child off to summer camp and they've come back a monster,\" GOP Rep. Matt Gaetz of Florida said on the floor Thursday morning.\n\nGaetz was among the no votes.\n\nHouse Freedom Caucus members accused the bill's negotiators of secretive, non-inclusive negotiations during which their amendments to block a Department of Defense abortion policy, ban certain transgender care for troops and completely eliminate any Pentagon diversity, equity and inclusion, or DEI, programs were nixed.\n\n\"The Swamp's 'compromise' NDAA allows the DOD to use your tax dollars to fund abortion travel for servicemembers. As a proud pro-life conservative, I'll be voting NO,\" Rep. Andrew Clyde of Georgia posted Tuesday night on X after the Senate voted to advance the bill.\n\nGOP Rep. Ralph Norman of South Carolina wrote on social media Wednesday that \"The Backroom NDAA is a disaster for conservatives in so many ways.\"\n\nThe Pentagon's abortion policy gives time off and travel reimbursement for service members who seek abortions in states where it remains legal. The policy, instated after the U.S. Supreme Court struck down Roe v. Wade, fueled Alabama GOP Sen. Tommy Tuberville's monthslong freeze on military promotions.\n\nClyde and Norman both opposed the NDAA Thursday morning, along with outgoing House Freedom Caucus Chair Rep. Scott Perry of Pennsylvania.\n\nSome members of the Congressional Progressive Caucus who voted no included its chair Pramila Jayapal of Washington, deputy chair Ilhan Omar of Minnesota, Rashida Tlaib of Michigan, Maxwell Frost of Florida, Cori Bush of Missouri, Summer Lee of Pennsylvania, Mark Pocan of Wisconsin and retiring Earl Blumenauer of Oregon.\n\nPolicies on flags, DEI hiring remain\n\nWhile some far-right House amendments are not in the final text, other conservative priorities remained, including a measure to prohibit, with some conditions negotiated by the Senate, the display of unapproved flags. Democrats protested the original language as a ban on LBGTQ+ flags.\n\nDespite throwing out the amendment to eliminate all DEI programs and positions, negotiators landed on a hiring freeze and pay grade cap for employees on the initiatives.\n\nThe Senate receded during negotiations and also allowed a House-led amendment to remain that bans any funding for critical race theory at military service academies and during training.\n\nNegotiators also kept a familiar conservative priority of codifying the rights of parents to review school curricula. The guarantee, usually already available to school parents, will now be codified in the NDAA for parents of schoolchildren enrolled in Department of Defense Education Activity programs.\n\nThe legislation heads to President Joe Biden's desk. The administration had called on Congress for the bill's \"swift passage.\"\n\nCongress has passed the NDAA for 63 consecutive years. The annual defense policy package typically draws bipartisan support.\n\nThe post Shipbuilding, bombers, military pay raise: Congress sends massive defense bill to Biden appeared first on Nebraska Examiner.\n\n0 Comments Love 0 Funny 0 Wow 0 Sad 0 Angry 0\n\nTags Wire Dcc States-newsroom Tncen D.c.

Is getting proper food? Is he OK or is he wounded?\" Moses asked, adding that he hopes for a Hanukkah miracle.\"Lighting the lights hopefully will bring us this miracle and the darkness we are in for the last two months will go away,\" he said.Because Hanukkah is almost over, Moses added that he's \"also willing to accept a Christmas miracle, any miracles that will come.\"A miracle did come recently. Last month. Moses' mother, Margalit, a cancer survivor whom Hamas also kidnapped on Oct. 7, was released.\"It was amazing. It was a pure joy. It was 24 hours that we allowed ourselves to put the worries to the side,\" Moses recalled.Recently, Margalit revealed in a video statement in Hebrew that while in captivity she barely slept because Hamas terrorists took away her CPAP machine, which treats her sleep apnea.\"And even though she told them 'I must have it in order to breathe,' they didn't give it back, just took it from her,'\" Moses told Scripps News.Now Margalit is back at home for Hanukkah and Moses recently lit candles with her, which was \"very, very joyful.\"But even in that joyful moment, Moses says he did not forget for a second about his 79-year-old dad, Gadi, and all of the other hostages.SEE MORE: Biden considers new border laws in effort to reach Ukraine aid deal",

        "body": "ATLANTA -- Atlanta United announced today it has signed American free agent goalkeeper Josh Cohen through the 2025 season with an option for 2026.\n\nCohen most recently played for Maccabi Haifa in the Israeli Premier League, where he won three consecutive league titles, was named the 2020-2021 Israeli Premier League Player of the Season and made six appearances in the 2022-2023 UEFA Champions League.\n\n\"Josh is someone with a unique career path who has backed himself at every step of his journey,\" Atlanta United Vice President and Technical Director Carlos Bocanegra said. \"He has shown the ability to compete at the highest level in the UEFA Europa League and Champions League.

        "title": "Congress Approves Extension Of Warrantless Surveillance Powers Opposed By Civil Libertarians - Conservative Angle",
        "body": "Update(1300ET): As expected given there were only a handful of senators and House reps opposing, Congress has approved the short-term extension of the US government's warrantless surveillance powers:\n\nCongress has approved a short-term extension of the nation's warrantless surveillance powers, punting to the new year a decision over how to reform the law.\n\nIncluded in the defense policy bill headed to the president's desk after approval by the House on Thursday is a measure that extends Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) until mid-April.\n\nHere's what Rep. Chip Roy of Texas had to say: \"The fact of the matter is what's being stated is it is impossible to oppose the National Defense Authorization Act because we put a pay raise in it or because we put something in there that is seemingly so important that we have to ignore the critical destruction of our civil liberties by adding FISA extension right on the top of it without doing the forms necessary to protect the American people.\"\n\nHe and some others have argued that the FISA issue should be a standalone bill and not part of the NDAA. Naturally, the US intelligence community praised its passage as \"necessary\" to national security.\n\n* * *\n\nAt a moment Republicans are continuing to hold out on their refusal to support a massive $111 billion supplemental spending package that Biden wants for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan - the Senate did manage to get something big done, namely passage of the mammoth $886 billion 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).\n\nIt passed on Wednesday, authorizing funding for the Department of Defense for this next year, in a vote of 87-13. Those voting against it included six Republicans, six Democrats, and an Independent. It now heads to the House where a vote is expected Thursday.\n\nThe no votes included GOP hardliners who \"have been criticizing House Republicans... after the text of the compromise with the Democrat-controlled Senate removed a number of conservative policy goals on transgender surgeries and abortion, among others,\" according to FOX.\n\nOther controversial, arguably more pressing aspects which also attracted a minority of Democrat criticism includes an amendment to extend Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).\n\nThis controversially allows warrantless spying of foreign targets and Americans who have communications with those foreign subjects. The new extension in the NDAA authorizes it further until at least April 19.\n\nSen. Mike Lee raised the alarm on the FISA issue in particular, writing on X, \"The Senate just voted to waive the point of order against the NDAA. 35 of us opposed the motion to waive. We needed only 41 to prevent this outcome, and to remove FISA 702 from the NDAA. This is not good. The House should #StopTheNDAA.\"\n\nAnd here's what Sen. Lee is urging Americans to do:\n\nIt's a new day in America. The Fourth Amendment still prohibits warrantless searches of Americans. FBI disregards that under FISA 702. The NDAA would further enable FBI's lawless abuse of 702. One-third of the House can still stop the NDAA. Ask your representative to vote NO!!!\n\nRand Paul was another objector. House Rep from the same state of Kentucky Thomas Massie had this to say: \"It was close in the Senate, but now it's up to the House tomorrow to stop the reauthorization of warrantless spying on Americans.\"\n\nNSA whistleblower Edward Snowden also urged Americans to voice their opposition to the NDAA...\n\nEven CNN has highlighted that Section 702 easily sets up the government to exploit the law and conduct mass wireless spying, a severe violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n\n\"The searches are governed by a set of internal rules and procedures designed to protect Americans' privacy and civil liberties, but critics say that loopholes allow the FBI to search the data it collects for Americans' information - as opposed to from foreign adversaries - without proper justification,\" CNN writes.\n\nAlso interesting is another fight centered on historic abuse of government power, as The Hill details:\n\nThe rocky relationship between Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), a rising conservative populist star, is in the spotlight after McConnell played a leading role in killing a Hawley-sponsored amendment to the annual defense bill.\n\nFurther, \"Hawley says McConnell was dead set on killing his provision, which would have provided compensation to St. Louis-area residents who were exposed to radiation from improperly stored nuclear waste left over from the Manhattan Project in the 1940s.\"",

        "title": "Congress Passes $886 Billion Defense Policy Bill With Military Pay Raise, Spy Tool Extension, And Ukraine Aid - Conservative Angle",
        "body": "Congress passed the annual defense policy bill this week, authorizing $886 billion for a host of national security programs for the current fiscal year that began on October 1 -- about 3% higher than the previous year's levels.\n\nThe Democrat-led Senate approved the legislation, known as the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), in a 87-13 vote on Wednesday, and the GOP-controlled House followed suit by passing the legislation in a 310-118 vote on Thursday, sending the legislation to President Joe Biden for a signature.\n\nThe final NDAA, a compromise of the House and Senate version that came out of the conference process, sets national security policies with a heavy focus on boosting the military, improving technology development, and countering U.S. adversaries such as Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.\n\n\"At a time of huge trouble for global security, passing the defense authorization bill is more important than ever,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). \"It will ensure America can hold the line against Russia, stand firm against the Chinese Communist Party, and ensures that America's military remains state of the art at all times, all around the world.\"\n\nWithin its many provisions, the NDAA boasts a 5.2% pay raise for members of the military -- the largest bump in 20 years -- sections that seek to restrain facets of \"woke\" ideology, pared-down UFO disclosure language, a four-month extension of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), the authorization of $600 million to boost a Ukraine security assistance program spread across the next couple years, and much more.\n\nThe NDAA does not provide budget authority, which is given in appropriations legislation, and it is separate from the supplemental national security package being debated in Congress at the behest of Biden. Democrats are trying to pass more than $100 billion in funds for Ukraine, Israel, and more, but Republicans demand \"transformative\" border security reforms be included in it.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP\n\nCounted among the NDAA's opponents were many Republicans and some Democrats. Some cited objections to the temporary extension of FISA Section 702, which has long stirred privacy concerns, and the additional funds for Ukraine. Others argued that the NDAA did not do enough to crack down on \"woke\" initiatives, the \"radical climate agenda,\" and taxpayer-funded transgender surgeries. \"The NDAA is a BAD deal,\" Rep. Randy Weber (R-TX) said in a post to X.",

Tales By Light, which began as a short series from Canon and evolved into a partnership with National Geographic, introduces you to one amazing photographer in each episode and takes you along his or her next journey to capture elusive wildlife, unique communities, and stunning landscapes. The almost metaphysical look through the lens at another person looking through a lens encourages you to see the subject matter in a slightly different light (no pun on the show's name intended).

        "title": "Congress Passes $886 Billion Defense Policy Bill With Military Pay Raise, Spy Tool Extension, And Ukraine Aid",
        "body": "Congress passed the annual defense policy bill this week, authorizing $886 billion for a host of national security programs for the current fiscal year that began on October 1 -- about 3% higher than the previous year's levels.\n\nThe Democrat-led Senate approved the legislation, known as the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), in a 87-13 vote on Wednesday, and the GOP-controlled House followed suit by passing the legislation in a 310-118 vote on Thursday, sending the legislation to President Joe Biden for a signature.\n\nThe final NDAA, a compromise of the House and Senate version that came out of the conference process, sets national security policies with a heavy focus on boosting the military, improving technology development, and countering U.S. adversaries such as Russia, China, Iran, and North Korea.\n\n\"At a time of huge trouble for global security, passing the defense authorization bill is more important than ever,\" said Senate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer (D-NY). \"It will ensure America can hold the line against Russia, stand firm against the Chinese Communist Party, and ensures that America's military remains state of the art at all times, all around the world.\"\n\nWithin its many provisions, the NDAA boasts a 5.2% pay raise for members of the military -- the largest bump in 20 years -- sections that seek to restrain facets of \"woke\" ideology, pared-down UFO disclosure language, a four-month extension of Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA), the authorization of $600 million to boost a Ukraine security assistance program spread across the next couple years, and much more.\n\nThe NDAA does not provide budget authority, which is given in appropriations legislation, and it is separate from the supplemental national security package being debated in Congress at the behest of Biden. Democrats are trying to pass more than $100 billion in funds for Ukraine, Israel, and more, but Republicans demand \"transformative\" border security reforms be included in it.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE DAILYWIRE+ APP\n\nCounted among the NDAA's opponents were many Republicans and some Democrats. Some cited objections to the temporary extension of FISA Section 702, which has long stirred privacy concerns, and the additional funds for Ukraine. Others argued that the NDAA did not do enough to crack down on \"woke\" initiatives, the \"radical climate agenda,\" and taxpayer-funded transgender surgeries. \"The NDAA is a BAD deal,\" Rep. Randy Weber (R-TX) said in a post to X.",

        "title": "Congress Approves Extension Of Warrant-less Surveillance Powers Opposed By Civil Libertarians",
        "body": "Update(1300ET): As expected given there were only a handful of senators and House reps opposing, Congress has approved the short-term extension of the US government's warrantless surveillance powers:\n\nCongress has approved a short-term extension of the nation's warrantless surveillance powers, punting to the new year a decision over how to reform the law.\n\nIncluded in the defense policy bill headed to the president's desk after approval by the House on Thursday is a measure that extends Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA) until mid-April.\n\nHere's what Rep. Chip Roy of Texas had to say: \"The fact of the matter is what's being stated is it is impossible to oppose the National Defense Authorization Act because we put a pay raise in it or because we put something in there that is seemingly so important that we have to ignore the critical destruction of our civil liberties by adding FISA extension right on the top of it without doing the forms necessary to protect the American people.\"\n\nHe and some others have argued that the FISA issue should be a standalone bill and not part of the NDAA. Naturally, the US intelligence community praised its passage as \"necessary\" to national security.\n\nAt a moment Republicans are continuing to hold out on their refusal to support a massive $111 billion supplemental spending package that Biden wants for Ukraine, Israel, and Taiwan - the Senate did manage to get something big done, namely passage of the mammoth $886 billion 2024 National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA).\n\nIt passed on Wednesday, authorizing funding for the Department of Defense for this next year, in a vote of 87-13. Those voting against it included six Republicans, six Democrats, and an Independent. It now heads to the House where a vote is expected Thursday.\n\nThe no votes included GOP hardliners who \"have been criticizing House Republicans... after the text of the compromise with the Democrat-controlled Senate removed a number of conservative policy goals on transgender surgeries and abortion, among others,\" according to FOX.\n\nOther controversial, arguably more pressing aspects which also attracted a minority of Democrat criticism includes an amendment to extend Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act (FISA).\n\nThis controversially allows warrantless spying of foreign targets and Americans who have communications with those foreign subjects. The new extension in the NDAA authorizes it further until at least April 19.\n\nSen. Mike Lee raised the alarm on the FISA issue in particular, writing on X, \"The Senate just voted to waive the point of order against the NDAA. 35 of us opposed the motion to waive. We needed only 41 to prevent this outcome, and to remove FISA 702 from the NDAA. This is not good. The House should #StopTheNDAA.\"\n\nAnd here's what Sen. Lee is urging Americans to do:\n\nIt's a new day in America. The Fourth Amendment still prohibits warrantless searches of Americans. FBI disregards that under FISA 702. The NDAA would further enable FBI's lawless abuse of 702. One-third of the House can still stop the NDAA. Ask your representative to vote NO!!!\n\nRand Paul was another objector. House Rep from the same state of Kentucky Thomas Massie had this to say: \"It was close in the Senate, but now it's up to the House tomorrow to stop the reauthorization of warrantless spying on Americans.\"\n\nNSA whistleblower Edward Snowden also urged Americans to voice their opposition to the NDAA...\n\nEven CNN has highlighted that Section 702 easily sets up the government to exploit the law and conduct mass wireless spying, a severe violation of the Fourth Amendment.\n\n\"The searches are governed by a set of internal rules and procedures designed to protect Americans' privacy and civil liberties, but critics say that loopholes allow the FBI to search the data it collects for Americans' information - as opposed to from foreign adversaries - without proper justification,\" CNN writes.\n\nAlso interesting is another fight centered on historic abuse of government power, as The Hill details:\n\nThe rocky relationship between Senate Republican Leader Mitch McConnell (Ky.) and Sen. Josh Hawley (R-Mo.), a rising conservative populist star, is in the spotlight after McConnell played a leading role in killing a Hawley-sponsored amendment to the annual defense bill.\n\nFurther, \"Hawley says McConnell was dead set on killing his provision, which would have provided compensation to St. Louis-area residents who were exposed to radiation from improperly stored nuclear waste left over from the Manhattan Project in the 1940s.\"",

        "body": "The Feast of the Baptism of Our Lord is celebrated each year on the Sunday following the Feast of the Epiphany on January 6. The event of Christ's baptism is recorded in all four gospel accounts:\n\n\"In those days Jesus came from Nazareth of Galilee and was baptized by John in the Jordan. And just as he was coming up out of the water, he saw the heavens torn apart and the Spirit descending like a dove on him. And a voice came from heaven, 'You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased'\" (Mark 1:9-11).\n\n\"Now when all the people were baptized, and when Jesus also had been baptized and was praying, the heaven was opened, and the Holy Spirit descended upon him in bodily form like a dove. And a voice came from heaven, 'You are my Son, the Beloved; with you I am well pleased'\" (Luke 3:21-22).\n\n\"The next day he saw Jesus coming towards him and declared, 'Here is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world! This is he of whom I said, \"After me comes a man who ranks ahead of me because he was before me.\" I myself did not know him; but I came baptizing with water for this reason, that he might be revealed to Israel.' And John testified, 'I saw the Spirit descending from heaven like a dove, and it remained on him. I myself did not know him, but the one who sent me to baptize with water said to me, \"He on whom you see the Spirit descend and remain is the one who baptizes with the Holy Spirit.\" And I myself have seen and have testified that this is the Son of God'\" (John 1:29-34).\n\n\"Then Jesus came from Galilee to John at the Jordan, to be baptized by him. John would have prevented him, saying, 'I need to be baptized by you, and do you come to me?' But Jesus answered him, 'Let it be so now; for it is proper for us in this way to fulfill all righteousness.' Then he consented. And when Jesus had been baptized, just as he came up from the water, suddenly the heavens were opened to him and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and alighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, 'This is my Son, the Beloved, with whom I am well pleased'\" (Matthew 3:13-17).",

        "title": "Pakistan's military and foreign policy under Gen. Asim Munir",
        "body": "Functioning as a security state, Pakistan has long formulated its foreign policy choices based on security needs and the aspiration to establish itself as a hard military power. This approach has allowed the military to play a leading role in shaping both domestic and foreign policy decisions, often overshadowing civilian institutions. However, with changing global dynamics, the current civil-military establishment is actively signaling a shift in Pakistan's strategic culture and foreign policy interests.\n\nIt has been just over a year since Gen. Asim Munir took command of Pakistan's military, succeeding Gen. (retired) Qamar Javed Bajwa in late November 2022. Apart from stepping into the most powerful role in Pakistan, Gen. Munir also inherited the legacy of Gen. Bajwa's military doctrine, which not only shaped Pakistan's foreign policy but also presented considerable challenges for him to address. Throughout his tenure, Gen. Bajwa orchestrated a paradigm shift in Pakistan's traditional geostrategic focus, transitioning from geopolitics to geoeconomics. This shift involved broadening the scope of Pakistan's national security, moving beyond a primary emphasis on military defense, and recognizing economic security as a crucial factor for achieving improved traditional security outcomes.\n\nTo safeguard economic security, Gen. Bajwa aimed to enhance Pakistan's geostrategic importance by prioritizing regional connectivity and global development partnerships. He sought to position Pakistan as a key hub for trade, transit, and production in West, Central, and South Asia, intending to transition from aid-based dependencies to trade and investment partnerships. Gen. Bajwa fell short of fully realizing his vision during his six years in office, with Pakistan continuing to rely heavily on International Monetary Fund (IMF) loans to support its declining economy. Gen. Munir now faces the challenging task of turning Gen. Bajwa's unrealized vision into a reality. This requires cultivating positive interdependence and multi-alignment with a diverse range of partners, while also ensuring domestic stability. An examination of Gen. Munir's first year in office is crucial to assess his progress thus far and gain insight into the military's current foreign policy vision.\n\nMunir doctrine\n\nA crucial aspect of Gen. Munir's doctrine involves guiding Pakistan away from the strategic dilemma of choosing between the U.S. and China, and avoiding the significant costs it has incurred for Islamabad's foreign policy. Gen. Munir has made clear a preference for pursuing a hedging strategy, aiming to avoid getting entangled in global binary politics. His strategic approach is centered on maximizing Pakistan's economic gains to avoid subservience to major powers and increase its room for maneuver. He articulated this vision for defending Pakistan's sovereignty by building a robust economy, emphasizing that, \"all Pakistanis must throw out the beggar's bowl.\"\n\nAt least three interrelated points characterize Gen. Munir's foreign policy vision, each representing significant challenges he must confront. These observations are drawn from his statements and actions up to this point. First, he has expressed a commitment to project and advance a softer image of Pakistan. Second, he has demonstrated a keen interest in elevating Pakistan as a regional middle power. Third, he has placed a significant focus on prioritizing geoeconomics over geopolitics.\n\nRevamping Pakistan's image\n\nA state's image and reputation are pivotal in achieving foreign policy goals. Pakistan's global reputation is currently plagued by a host of domestic issues, all of which paint a picture of the country as a struggling democracy grappling with internal turmoil. Recent regime changes, the constitutional crisis over the next general elections, growing insecurity and the rise in terrorist attacks, escalating debt, human rights violations, political instability, socioeconomic disparities, growing inflation, and energy crises have all taken a toll on Pakistan's standing in the international community. The country is increasingly perceived as an elitist state that struggles to address the genuine concerns of its citizens, moving closer to a praetorian state. This negative image is partly due to the hybrid governance model adopted prior to Gen. Munir's appointment, disrupting the balance of power between civilian and military authorities.\n\nUnder this system, the military has gained legal authority to govern key state institutions, but this has eroded its public image, a problem that has been exacerbated by allegations from popular leader Imran Khan of undermining democracy. At present, there are lingering suspicions that the next general elections, currently scheduled for Feb. 8, 2024, may not take place until Khan is absent from the political landscape. Despite being imprisoned and facing a ban from politics, Khan maintains significant popularity compared to his political rivals. As long as his Pakistan Tehreek-e-Insaf party remains a legitimate political entity, it poses a potential risk of securing a majority in parliament, a scenario the military establishment is unwilling to tolerate. For their part, Western nations, including the U.S. and EU, have issued warnings about potential consequences if the elections are delayed further or conducted unfairly. Adding to Pakistan's challenges, a group of U.S. members of Congress recently urged the Biden administration to withhold military aid due to concerns over human rights abuses.\n\nDismissing such negative perceptions, Gen. Munir has pledged his commitment to upholding democracy in Pakistan. This underscores a major aspect of the Munir doctrine, which aims to restore the military's soft image both at home and abroad while retaining its influence in the country's governance. Affirming Gen. Munir's position, Interim Prime Minister Anwar-ul-Haq Kakar has asserted that the military's involvement in state governance is solely due to its organizational capabilities and has dismissed concerns that it might seek to manipulate the upcoming elections.\n\nTransforming Pakistan into a stabilizing regional security actor\n\nHistorically, Pakistan has leveraged its advanced military capabilities as a crucial asset in its foreign relations, a reason why its defense cooperation takes precedence over economic ties with other countries. This security-centric foreign policy strategy has played a pivotal role in sustaining the functionality and institutional capacity of the military, even during the most testing periods. However, despite entering significant security and defense agreements, Pakistan has been unable to achieve much-needed stability and security. A primary factor contributing to this challenge is the hostile internal and regional security environment in which Pakistan is situated. Gen. Munir's foreign policy vision reflects this strategic thinking, as evidenced by his statements and efforts in defense diplomacy. He has expressed his desire to defend Pakistan against internal and cross-border terrorism while simultaneously transforming the country into a stabilizing regional security actor.\n\nIn terms of foreign policy initiatives, Gen. Munir has carved out a distinctive path, particularly in relation to India and Afghanistan. Taking a stern stance toward India, Munir has issued warnings of a swift proportional response in the event of an attack. He has also accused India of waging a proxy war against Pakistan through terrorist organizations. Deviating from the traditional friendly ties between Pakistan's military and the Afghan Taliban, Gen. Munir has chosen to pursue a more adversarial policy toward the Kabul regime. Accusing the Afghan government of sheltering anti-Pakistan terrorists, he has threatened a robust military response if Pakistan's security demands are not met. The ongoing deportation of 1.7 million Afghans residing in Pakistan is evidence of Gen. Munir's stringent policy against the Afghan Taliban. In defense of the massive deportations, Gen. Munir has contended that the expulsion of Afghans, whom he alleges to be involved in most terrorist activities in Pakistan, would enhance the country's internal security.\n\nStriving for strategic neutrality\n\nGen. Munir has articulated his aspiration to safeguard Pakistan's strategic autonomy and territorial integrity, with the objective of maintaining a neutral middle power status in the global context. This vision may have taken shape as a response to the deliberate strategic maneuvers of middle powers, which have astutely capitalized on the rivalry between the West and Russia, as well as the competition between the United States and China, to bolster their bargaining positions, all while avoiding being ensnared in their confrontations. Achieving genuine neutrality may be a tall order though and would require, first and foremost, full independence from foreign aid.\n\nUnfortunately, at present Pakistan is highly reliant on external aid to meet its needs. Bound by geographic, geopolitical, and geoeconomic constraints, Pakistan often finds itself with limited options, at times playing a subservient role to major global powers. In the face of fervent appeals from substantial segments of Pakistani society, calling on the military to lend support to Hamas against Israel and to diplomatically boycott Western backers of Israel, including the United States, Gen. Munir has opted to abstain from such actions.\n\nIn contrast, he seems focused on navigating Pakistan's response to the demands of both the United States and China without stirring tensions with either side. He has sought to enhance Pakistan-U.S. defense ties, rekindling U.S. interest in the country after a previous inclination to disengage. A notable case in point is the renewal of the Communications and Information Security Memorandum of Agreement (CISMOA), a crucial element of U.S.-Pakistan defense cooperation, through which the U.S. has extended its offer to assist Pakistan in counterterrorism efforts. To further solidify ties, Gen. Munir visited Washington in mid-December for discussions with senior U.S. military and Biden administration officials, seeking to strengthen U.S.-Pakistan military cooperation and foster investment in Pakistan by urging the U.S. government to explore opportunities through the newly established Special Investment Facility Council (SIFC, see below). As for China, despite reports of Beijing's reluctance to add more projects to the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC) due to performance issues on Pakistan's part, Gen. Munir's renewed commitment to ensuring the security of Chinese interests has injected new life into previously stagnant CPEC projects.\n\nPrioritizing geoeconomics for Pakistan's economic revival\n\nOne of Gen. Munir's major foreign policy objectives is to address Pakistan's economic challenges through cooperation with friendly nations. His vision for Pakistan's economic growth and prosperity emerged when he took on a diplomatic role in securing funding from the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia to fulfill IMF preconditions for a crucial bailout package. While this prevented Pakistan from facing a debt default, it also brought significant embarrassment due to the harsh conditions attached to the IMF bailout in an already crisis-ridden country.\n\nIndicating a shift away from geopolitics and toward geoeconomics, Gen. Munir has committed to leading Pakistan toward self-reliance by leveraging its resource advantages. His vision includes a policy aimed at ending dependency and promoting self-sufficiency. To expedite these initiatives, a new \"single-window\" investment facilitation body, the SIFC, was established under his leadership in June of this year. Its primary objective is to attract foreign investments across various sectors, such as mining, agriculture, information technology, and energy, from affluent Gulf countries, China, and the United States.\n\nGen. Munir has urged foreign investors to explore Pakistan's untapped natural resources, estimated to be worth $6 trillion, including deposits of copper, gold, sulfur, lead, and zinc, among others. He has also encouraged local investors to participate in these endeavors. In discussions with Pakistan's business community, Gen. Munir outlined his plans for economic recovery. Emphasizing his commitment to geoeconomics, he underscored his efforts to convince Gulf monarchs to consider investing up to $100 billion in Pakistan. Gen. Munir's broader approach to economic diplomacy underscores his vision, favoring development partnerships over development assistance. This shift also signifies a change in Pakistan's traditional military approach of providing military bases to now offering economic bases.\n\nKey takeaways\n\nGen. Munir's geostrategic vision for Pakistan, though it may sound idealistic, has already scored several successes. To revive the domestic economy, he has launched a comprehensive crackdown on corruption, smuggling, energy theft, illegal practices, and unauthorized immigration. Gen. Munir has earned praise for his commitment to revitalizing Pakistan's economy, presenting himself as the guarantor of stability in the country and the primary point of contact for the international community. This underscores his aim of transforming Pakistan into an important market that can bring together various global economic interests.\n\nOn the security front, Gen. Munir has escalated military operations against terrorist outfits like Tehreek-e-Taliban Pakistan, declining to engage in talks for peace. Furthermore, he has strengthened the military's defense engagements by forging military cooperation agreements with countries across the Central, West, East, and South Asian regions. Pakistan recently hosted the \"Eternal Brotherhood-II\" multinational counterterrorism exercise, reflecting Gen. Munir's two-pronged strategy. Firstly, he aims to capitalize on Pakistan's pivotal role in combating terrorism originating from Afghanistan, addressing concerns among both neighboring nations and global powers such as the U.S., China, and Russia. Secondly, he seeks to counterbalance India's influence by strengthening regional military alliances.\n\nAt the same time, Gen. Munir's foreign policy aspirations entail significant risk and could have serious consequences for Pakistan. To begin with, it remains uncertain whether his expanded role in governance will effectively enhance the military's softer image and bolster Pakistan's global reputation, especially given that many of its major challenges are still attributed to the actions of the military establishment. Additionally, establishing Pakistan as a stabilizing regional security actor seems to be a daunting task, particularly in the context of heightened tensions with its immediate neighbor, Afghanistan. Achieving a neutral middle power status presents its own set of difficulties, and this objective may prove elusive until Pakistan gains a certain level of economic independence.\n\nTo date, Pakistan's efforts to attract significant new investments from the Gulf states have run into difficulties, given the latter's predominant focus on the ongoing Gaza crisis. There is limited evidence to suggest that Gulf nations will come to Pakistan's aid in the near future. As a result, the SIFC has struggled to finalize long-awaited billion-dollar foreign transactions. With limited foreign support available, Pakistan continues to heavily depend on financial assistance from organizations like the IMF and investments from China.\n\nIt seems that the most critical foreign policy challenge confronting Gen. Munir is the integration of soft power with hard power. This requires finding a delicate balance between security and economic considerations, necessitating a departure from traditional military strategies to embrace alternative methods of advancing national interests. Given the unique strategic culture of the military, which may lack an understanding of the nuances of civilian affairs and the intricacies of soft power, expectations for progress from Gen. Munir may be limited.\n\nWith two more years ahead, the success of Gen. Munir's foreign policy hinges on addressing several crucial questions. How does he plan to balance fostering economic growth with Pakistan's current economic dependence? Could Gen. Munir's geoeconomic strategy unintentionally lead Pakistan into another debt trap? To prevent Pakistan from becoming overly reliant on the exploitation of natural resources and transforming into a rentier state, what proactive measures does he intend to take?\n\nAdditionally, as Pakistan navigates strained relations with neighboring India and Afghanistan, how will Gen. Munir achieve Pakistan's long-term security goals? Moreover, how does he plan to navigate its position amid the rivalry between the United States and China without taking sides? Importantly, what specific steps will he take to bridge the gap between civilian leadership and the military establishment, ensuring a cohesive and effective foreign policy strategy?\n\nNaad-e-Ali Sulehria has over five years of involvement working with international organizations and think tanks in different capacities as a political researcher, policy advisor, peace strategist, and human rights practitioner.

If you believe Portland benefits from smart, local journalism and arts coverage, please consider making a small monthly contribution, because without you, there is no us. Thanks for your support!\n\nGOOD MORNING, PORTLAND! Light showers return today with a high of 52, but the sun has promised to make a return this Saturday (just in time for you to get trapped at the mall while trying to finish your holiday shopping). And now, allow me to trap you in this mall of NEWS.\n\nIN LOCAL NEWS:\n\n* Portland Commish Carmen Rubio announced yesterday that she'll be spreading the love of the city's Clean Energy Fund, allocating $540 million from the program to go to climate projects within six bureaus -- including Commissioner Mingus Mapps' beleaguered Bureau of Transportation. These climate-friendly projects include beefing up biking networks, tree planting, energy efficient upgrades, replacing gas-powered leaf blowers, and more. (Rubio's generosity is not only a boon to her struggling fellow commissioners, but will certainly get her expected announcement of a mayoral campaign off on the right foot.) OH, and speaking of mayoral campaigns (this time of the doomed variety)....\n\n* The WW interviewed (wildly unqualified and mostly disliked) mayoral candidates Mingus Mapps and Rene Gonzalez, asking them about their greatest accomplishments and mistakes. Here's Rene on his attempts to sabotage charter reform, and how he got big \"fuck around and find out\" vibes in return:\n\n* It's looking like Portland's Thompson Elk fountain on SW Main will be reinstalled sometime next fall after funds have been attained to clean and repair the moderate damage done to it during the 2020 racial justice protests. You may remember Commissioner Dan Ryan's dramatic tweet likening it to \"the soul of Portland\" which caused the eyes of many locals to roll out of their heads -- but it will be a welcome return, if nothing else, because of the addition of a sweet, honkin' big bike lane that will undoubtedly drive the scrooges of People for Portland and the local business alliance out of their got-damned minds, he-he-he.\n\n* Pour one out for what's about to happen to that poor robot:\n\n* A proposed mass shelter for houseless folk, intended to include RV parking, tent space, tiny cabins, and more, is suddenly looking like less than a done deal after North Portland neighbors and environmentalists pointed out that it could potentially be sitting on a contaminated toxic chemical site -- though the city is welcoming any and all tests, saying they will mitigate any danger before residents move in.\n\n* In this week's edition of HEAR IN PORTLAND (your weekly dose of music news that keeps you looking smart and cool), you'll read about a new collab from a Portlander who (unfortunately just moved away), an awesome New Year's Eve show where you just might end up on a rooftop, and a little something for your January calendar -- because it's about to be Portland Music Month!\n\nIN NATIONAL/WORLD NEWS:\n\n* Because they are such feckless, theatrical losers, the House GOP is continuing their efforts to launch a Biden impeachment inquiry -- even though they haven't been able to come up with any evidence of crimes he's supposedly committed. 🙄\n\n* Despite the number of their own soldiers being killed after launching a ground offensive in Gaza, Israel is stubbornly doubling down on their attacks on Palestinians, predicting that the conflict (and senseless killing) could continue for months.\n\n* A Delaware domestic terrorist has pleaded guilty to attacking officers at the nation's capitol on January 6, 2021, after his attorney explained to the judge that his client had been overwhelmed by \"Foxmania,\" and actually deeply believed the bullshit the right-wing news network had been feeding him. (Taking applications for Portlanders afflicted by \"Mercurymania\" if anyone is interested?)\n\n* Trump crony Rudy Giuliani has had a change of heart and will not be testifying in his own defense in his Georgia election worker defamation case. He was previously planning on being the only witness called to the stand... but maybe he's finally realized there is no logical defense for his actions.",

        "body": "Most will wholeheartedly agree that Christmas is the best period of the entire year. All the gifts, the meals, the gorgeous lighting displays, and the gatherings with family and friends certainly make Christmas a fun-filled and beautiful time. However, without recognizing the significance and importance of the birth of Christ, Christmas is a meaningless celebration.\n\nIn a clip posted on YouTube, three musicians - two men and a young lady - who call themselves Life in 3D sing about that first Christmas, \"The First Noel.\" Their sweet, soothing voices are simply angelic. All three demonstrate their massive talent throughout the nearly 2-and-a-half-minute video, creating a most pleasant listening experience.\n\n\"The first Noel the angels did say\n\nWas to certain poor shepherds in fields say they lay\n\nIn fields where they lay keeping their sheep\n\nOn a cold winter's night that was so deep\n\nNoel Noel Noel Noel\"\n\nOthers who commented on the YouTube link also appreciated Life in 3D's inspired performance of the beloved Christmas tune.\n\n\"You 3 are perfection when singing praises to God. Thanks again,\" one person wrote.\n\n\"Beautiful, stunning. Awesome! Perfect harmony! God blessed you 3 with so much talent!\" a second individual posted.\n\n\"Thank you so much for this beautiful song. You all have beautiful voices. Thank you again, and stay blessed. Amen,\" someone else added.\n\n\"The First Noel\" is a tune that has been sung and recorded by a number of musicians over the years. It's likely that any musician with even the smallest amount of fame or notoriety has a version of \"The First Noel\" floating around somewhere.\n\nHowever, no matter how many times you may have heard the song about the newborn King, it never loses its meaning. Born is the King of Israel! The moment that precious child, born in Bethlehem stable, who brought hope to a lost and broken world, is still a reason for celebration.\n\nIsaiah 7:14: \"Therefore the Lord himself shall give you a sign; Behold, a virgin shall conceive, and bear a son, and shall call his name Immanuel.\"\n\nPhoto Courtesy: 'The First Noel'/Life in 3D via YouTube/12/13/23 @5:15pm\n\nVideo Courtesy: Life in 3D via YouTube",

        "title": "PHOTOS: Hanukkah Events in Jerusalem Focus on Finding Light, Hope, and Faith in Dark Times",
        "body": "After some welcoming words and the recitation of the blessings of Hanukkah, the first candle of the festival was lit.\n\nOn the first evening of Hanukkah, Dec. 7, under a large tent in Jerusalem, an emerging community of Israeli Jews of all backgrounds called Kehilat Zion gathered together to dream again about Jerusalem as \"a meeting place for all.\"\n\nThe event brought together dozens of Jewish believers and representatives from various faith traditions, including Father Benedetto Di Bitonto, head of the Hebrew-speaking Catholic community in Jerusalem.\n\nAfter some welcoming words and the recitation of the blessings of Hanukkah, the first candle of the festival was lit. This was followed by a joyful moment of singing led by well-known Jewish singer Noa, who wrote of the experience on her Facebook page: \"Together we found a way, through the sorrow, to light a candle in the dark tent of the soul.\"\n\nThe founder and leader of Kehilat Zion is Rabbi Tamar Elad-Appelbaum. She told CNA that \"Jews have always -- even in the biggest darkness -- lit a light in the world: a light of hope, a light of faith, a light of brotherhood.\"\n\nShe continued: \"In this year, so full of darkness, sadness, and brokenness, and so much worry for the people who are hostages in Gaza, we gathered together to light the first light with people from all faiths. We stand together and send our light, our support and prayers, to the hostages in Gaza. We send them through the tunnels, light, and send the world, through every prayer, the hope that we will stand alongside the truth, the kindness, and the good.\"\n\nOne participant, Noam Dan, told CNA that she almost didn't come.\n\n\"At first, I thought I'm not going to celebrate, and I'm not going to light candles. I didn't feel in the mood to celebrate,\" she said. Dan lives in Jerusalem with her husband and children, but her family is originally from kibbutz Nir Oz, close to the Gaza Strip, one of those most affected by the Hamas massacres Oct. 7. Five members of her family disappeared that day.\n\n\"It took us two weeks to find out that two of them -- my aunt Carmela, 80, and her granddaughter Noya, 13 -- had been murdered,\" she said. The other three were kidnapped to Gaza: Erez, 11, and Sahar, 16, were freed Nov. 27, while their father, Ofer Kalderon, 53, is still there and wounded. That, she said, makes this Hanukkah very different from others.\n\n\"I changed my mind and decided to join the celebrations. I decided this is the time to choose life, to show my kids... to choose life and to choose light, also for all the hostages who cannot see the light while they're prisoners,\" she said.\n\nThe term Hanukkah means \"dedication\" or \"inauguration.\" The eight-day-and-night festival commemorates the rededication of the Temple in Jerusalem in the Hebrew year 3622 (165 B.C.) after the Maccabees' victory over the Seleucid king Antiochus IV Epiphanes. Antiochus had prohibited Jewish practices and desecrated the Temple by sacrificing to pagan gods.\n\nHanukkah was established by Judah Maccabee to celebrate this event:\n\n\"Judas and his brothers and all the assembly of Israel determined that every year at that season the days of dedication of the altar should be observed with joy and gladness for eight days, beginning with the 25th day of the month of Chislev\" (1 Mc 4:36-59).\n\nHanukkah is also known as the \"Festival of Lights\" because each night of the celebration, a candle is lit until all shine on the special nine-branched candelabrum called the \"hanukkiah\" (eight branches plus the central one -- the \"servant,\" from which all the others are lit).\n\nAccording to tradition, at the time of the purification of the Temple, only one vial of uncontaminated oil was found to light the lamp (menorah). The quantity was sufficient for only one day, yet the oil miraculously fueled the lamp for eight consecutive days.\n\nFather Di Bitonto, who is an expert in Judaism, told CNA that Hanukkah is a biblical feast even though \"it does not appear in the canon of the Hebrew Bible.\"\n\n\"The narrative is instead found in the First Book of Maccabees in the Christian Bible,\" he explained. Paradoxically, \"we Christians preserve the biblical text of the feast, while Jews celebrate the narrative of the feast, even though they don't have it in their sacred text.\"\n\nTypically, Jews display candlesticks behind windows or on windowsills, making them visible from the streets, or directly along the streets on the left side of the front door. The festival carries a joyful significance -- both for what it commemorates and the tradition of giving gifts to children.\n\nThis year, however, many do not feel like celebrating fully due to the ongoing war.\n\nEven in the Jewish Quarter of the Old City of Jerusalem, the lights are fewer than usual. The municipality has arranged a special setup in front of Jaffa Gate, one of the main entry points to the Old City. In the plaza beneath the walls, the word \"JERUSALEM,\" composed of nine letters, has become a large hanukkiah/menorah.\n\nThe organization Rabbis for Human Rights, a rabbinic organization in Israel explicitly dedicated to human rights, has organized a few interfaith Hanukkah events, coinciding with Human Rights Day.\n\nIn Jerusalem, on Dec. 12, an event was hosted by the Church of Scotland at St. Andrew's Scots Memorial Church, where rabbis expressed the desire for peace, hope, and justice -- values shared by all present, representing various faiths.\n\nIn the name of these values, the Hanukkah candles were lit.\n\n\"That was our first thought after Oct. 7,\" Rabbi Dana Sharon, head of Rabbis Network for Human Rights, told CNA. \"That we have to make religion a means of gathering people and bringing them closer together and to increase compassion, peace-seeking, and understanding of one another rather than a weapon. Religions have been weaponized in this part of the world for so long, and we -- all religions -- have lost core values completely to radical voices, and that needs to stop.\"\n\nFather Di Bitonto pointed out that Jesus celebrated Hanukkah.\n\n\"We read about it in the Gospel of John, where it is recounted that it was winter, and Jesus had gone up to Jerusalem for the dedication festival of the Temple (Jn 10:22),\" he said. \"As Christians, we have not maintained this festival ... and there is no connection with Christmas, as some may think... but the theme of light somewhat brings these two celebrations closer.\"\n\nAlthough the lights of these two festivals are distinct, being celebrated around the same time of the year, they, in a way, shine together.\n\n\"These are the lights we're all looking for,\" Rabbi Sharon said. \"And we're seeking to be that light, that beacon, that is reminding people that though things look dark, light is within us, especially when we are together, when we work together for a better reality, when we are not against each other.\"\n\nThis year, Hanukkah takes place from nightfall Dec. 7 to nightfall Dec. 15.",

(Credit: Agapito Sanchez, Baylor College of Medicine)\n\nThe Cerami Award honors investigators who have produced knowledge through their discoveries and innovations, o cure disease. It is conferred by the editors of Molecular Medicine, a peer-reviewed, open-access journal published by the Feinstein Institutes and BMC, part of Springer Nature. The award is made possible by the generosity of the Anthony Cerami and Ann Dunne Foundation for World Health, Inc. Dr. Cerami's breakthrough translational work includes the identification of the potential of anti-TNF antibodies to treat several inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis, and the development of the HbA1c Diagnostic Test - the gold standard for the diagnosis and control of diabetes. He is currently working on a potential treatment for diabetes as CEO of Tarrytown, NY-based Araim Pharmaceuticals.\n\nDr. Hotez, co-director of the Texas Children's Hospital Center for Vaccine Development and professor and dean of the National School of Tropical Medicine at Baylor College of Medicine, is an internationally recognized physician-scientist focusing on immunology, vaccinology and tropical medicine. He has been instrumental in shaping the understanding of various diseases, including parasitic infections and COVID-19. Dr. Hotez's extensive research has led to the development of vaccines and treatments that have positively impacted the lives of millions in low-income and marginalized communities, and he has acted in championing access to those vaccines globally and in the U.S. He has also been a champion of educating the lay community about infectious diseases and their prevention.\n\nAs a recipient of the award, Dr. Hotez is invited to share a monograph of his work, to be published in Molecular Medicine, that reveals the inspirations, insights, surprises, and conceptual advances that are woven into the history of his discoveries. If left untold, they may be lost from the permanent record.\n\n\"I have spent my career dedicated to understanding and combatting infectious diseases, particularly those that disproportionately affect the world's most vulnerable populations,\" said Dr. Hotez. \"The Cerami Award is not just a recognition of my work, but also a testament to the collective efforts of my colleagues. It highlights the importance of interdisciplinary collaboration, scientific inquiry, and the power of vaccines to transform lives.\"\n\nIn late 2021, Dr. Hotez led efforts at the Texas Children's Center for Vaccine Development to develop a low-cost recombinant protein COVID-19 vaccine for global health, resulting in emergency use authorization in India and Indonesia. Most recently, as both a vaccine scientist and parent of a child with autism, he has led national efforts to champion vaccines and educate the public on the science behind them.\n\nDr. Hotez obtained his undergraduate degree in molecular biophysics and biochemistry from Yale, followed by a Ph.D. degree in biochemistry from Rockefeller University in 1986, and an MD from Weill Cornell Medical College in 1987. He has authored more than 700 original papers and five single-authored books. Dr. Cerami was Dr. Hotez's former doctoral advisor at the Rockefeller University.\n\n\"The Feinstein Institutes and Molecular Medicine are delighted to recognize Dr. Peter Hotez for his remarkable achievements in the realm of molecular medicine and global health,\" said Betty Diamond, MD, director of the Institute of Molecular Medicine & Maureen and Ralph Nappi Professor of Autoimmune Diseases at the Feinstein Institutes and editor-in-chief of Molecular Medicine. \"The Cerami Award acknowledges his unwavering commitment to improving health care access and fostering scientific advancements that benefit people worldwide.\"\n\nPreviously, Dr. Hotez served as president of the American Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene, and in 2006 at the Clinton Global Initiative, he co-founded the Global Network for Neglected Tropical Diseases to provide access to essential medicines for hundreds of millions of people.\n\nHe is an elected member of the National Academy of Medicine and the American Academy of Arts & Sciences. From 2014 until 2016, Dr. Hotez served in the Obama Administration, focusing on vaccine diplomacy initiatives between the U.S. government and countries in the Middle East and North Africa. The U.S. State Department also appointed him to serve on the Board of Governors for the U.S. Israel Binational Science Foundation. He has been recognized for his work on vaccines from the AMA (American Medical Association), AAMC (Association of American Medical Colleges), AAAS (American Association for the Advancement of Science), the National Academy of Medicine and IDSA (Infectious Disease Society of America. His work to combat antisemitism was recognized by the Anti-Defamation League and B'nai B'rith International. He also holds three honorary doctoral degrees.\n\n\"The Anthony Cerami Award in Translational Medicine was established to recognize investigators who provide early knowledge that sparks future research which leads to new treatments for diseases,\" said Kevin J. Tracey, MD, president and CEO of the Feinstein Institutes and Karches Family Distinguished Chair in Medical Research, editor emeritus of Molecular Medicine, and Cerami Award committee member. \"Dr. Hotez's outstanding contributions to molecular medicine, immunization, and global health is an inspiring example for the scientific community.\"\n\nFor more information about the Cerami Award, visit: https://feinstein.northwell.edu/about-us/awards.\n\nAbout the Feinstein Institutes\n\nThe Feinstein Institutes for Medical Researchis the home of the research institutes of Northwell Health, the largest health care provider and private employer in New York State.

        "title": "Finding Joy in Justice",
        "body": "As liturgical celebrations approach Christmas, the readings for the third Sunday of Advent draw attention to the connection between belief and praise. This day is called Gaudete Sunday, taking its name from the Latin imperative, \"Rejoice!\" A curious pairing occurs towards the end of the first reading, \"The Lord God makes justice and praise spring up before all the nations\" (Is 61:11). The phrase \"justice and praise\" suggests that one follows the other. If there is justice, there is reason for praise. The converse is also true: The act of praise is a kind of justice.\n\nPart of biblical justice is knowing what to believe and understanding the basic tenets of one's faith. Within this Sunday's New Testament readings are short statements that probably represented early Christian credal formulas: \"The one who calls you is faithful,\" or \"He came for testimony, to testify to the light, so that all might believe through him.\" In this Sunday's responsorial canticle, Luke the Evangelist recognizes the synthesis between creed and action, justice and joy, \"My spirit rejoices in God my savior... he has filled the hungry with good things and sent the rich away empty.\"\n\nThis Sunday's first reading is a passage from the prophecy of Isaiah that Jesus later made his own vision for public ministry. \"The Lord has anointed me,\" reads Isaiah, \"to bring glad tidings to the poor, to heal the brokenhearted, to proclaim liberty to the captives and release to the prisoner\" (Is 61:1; see also Lk 4:18). These imperatives - to announce, to heal, to proclaim freedom and to release - were deeply embedded in the practice of Israel's faith, and they became fundamental to the Gospel that Jesus proclaimed. The joy that the Gospel inspired echoes throughout the books of the New Testament.\n\nThese \"glad tidings\" belong to anyone whose life mirrors Christ's Gospel of justice and reveals his love for the poor.\n\nThis Sunday's responsorial canticle comes from a passage called \"Mary's Magnificat\" in the opening chapter of Luke's Gospel. In response to the announcement from God's messenger, the archangel Gabriel, Mary gives praise to God. \"He has filled the hungry with good things,\" she sings, \"and the rich he has sent away empty. He has come to the help of his servant Israel for he has remembered his promise of mercy\" (Lk 1:53-54). Again, one can hear in Mary's song the ancient statement of Israel's deepest belief: God comes to \"help\" Israel and \"remembers\" the promise of mercy. When Mary experiences personally what Israel has always trusted in faith, she finds reason for praise and rejoicing.\n\nIn a somewhat different context, this Sunday's Gospel reading also speaks about belief through witness and testimony. John the Baptist downplays his own ministerial role in order to \"testify to the light.\" The passage reads, \"He was not the light, but came to testify to the light\" (Jn 1:8). In order to keep the focus on John the Baptist's witness, the lectionary omits John 1:9-18. These verses expand on the evangelist's theme of Christ as light. When \"the Word became flesh and made his dwelling among us,\" then \"we saw his glory, the glory as of the Father's only Son, full of grace and truth\" (Jn 1:14). Christ's light reveals the Father's glory. Just so, anyone who witnesses to Christ through action and belief reveals God's glory.\n\nThe fourth Gospel repeats the theme of \"light\" six times in its opening chapter. This is John the evangelist's attempt to transmit a part of an early Christian belief: The \"light\" is the One who became flesh, lived among us, and helped us to understand God. This revelation allows us to anticipate our Christmas joy even during these remaining days of Advent. \"The spirit of the Lord God is upon me,\" says Isaiah, \"because he has anointed me and has sent me to bring glad tidings to the poor\" (Is 61:1). These \"glad tidings\" belong to anyone whose life mirrors Christ's Gospel of justice and reveals his love for the poor.",

        "body": "In this article, we will take a detailed look at the 12 Best Reddit Stocks According to Billionaires. For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Best Reddit Stocks According to Billionaires.\n\nMarkets are euphoric after clear signals from the Fed that it is ready to start cutting interest rates next year. Nick Timiraos, Chief Economics Correspondent at the Wall Street Journal, talked about an interesting point in a program on CNBC on December 14. Timiraos said that if we analyze CPI and PPI reports of the past few months, the six-month annualized inflation rate comes out to be a little bit below 2%, which is the Fed's original inflation target. The journalist said that the Fed seems to have \"picked up on that\" important data point and categorically signaled the beginning of interest rate cuts next year. Timiraos believes that this is clearly the beginning of a pivot from the Fed and chances of another rate hike are thin.\n\nJim Cramer, like many other financial analysts and investors, is also jubilant over the Fed's signal. Cramer said that the bears never embraced the possibility that Jerome Powell could \"engineer\" a soft landing. He said that three rate cuts would mean \"smooth sailing\" for stocks. Cramer said that Powell's worries that the economy is slowing is \"good news\" and the Fed is now investors' \"pal\" instead of their \"enemy.\"\n\n\"Powell does not want to declare victory, I'll declare victory for him,\" Cramer said.\n\nMethodology\n\nAs the Wall Street paints the town red, it's time to look at some stocks Redditors as well as billionaires love. For this article we first listed down all stocks Redditors have been piling into this year. From this list we selected 12 stocks with the highest number of billionaire investors. We used Insider Monkey's database of billionaire-owned stocks to find the number of billionaire investors for each stock. Some notable names in the list include Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 8\n\nChinese EV company Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO) shares have lost about 24% year to date through December 13. Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO) recently announced to lay off 10% of its workforce, with Bloomberg reporting that Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO) plans to cut more jobs. These layoffs could target 20% to 30% of the total workforce, according to the Bloomberg report.\n\nOut of the billionaires tracked by Insider Monkey, 8 billionaires had stakes in the Chinese company Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO). The biggest stakeholder of Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO) was Jos Shaver's Electron Capital Partners which owns a $38 million stake in Nio Inc - ADR (NYSE:NIO).\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 10\n\nAMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) remains popular on Reddit, even though the stock has seen a decline in its favorability on the social platform as Redditors feel the heat of the broader market decline and pile into safer stocks. In November AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) posted strong Q3 results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at -$0.09, beating estimates by $0.16. Revenue in the period jumped about 45.2% year over year to $1.41 billion, surpassing estimates by $150 million.\n\nA total of 10 billionaires tracked by Insider Monkey had stakes in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC). Some famous billionaires having stakes in AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) include D. E. Shaw, Ken Griffin, Mario Gabelli and Cliff Asness.\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 14\n\nLululemon Athletica Inc (NASDAQ:LULU) ranks 10th in our list of the best Reddit stocks according to billionaires. Recently, Lululemon Athletica Inc (NASDAQ:LULU) posted third quarter results. Adjusted EPS in the period came in at $2.53, beating estimates by $0.25. Revenue in the quarter increased by about 18.3% year over year to $2.2 billion, beating estimates by $10 million.\n\nGoldman Sachs, in its 2024 outlook report, pointed to some trends that are going to benefit apparel and consumer stocks, including Lululemon Athletica Inc (NASDAQ:LULU).\n\n\"While near-term trends are likely still-volatile, we believe stronger consumer cash flow growth, healthier inventory levels, improved costing, and easier compares provide opportunities for stocks to outperform, led by margin-driven upside with optionality for earnings growth acceleration should top line sales growth inflect,\" the report said.\n\nIn addition to LULU, billionaires are also piling into Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT)\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 15\n\nReddit investors are no longer betting on just meme stocks or companies like AMC Entertainment Holdings Inc (NYSE:AMC) or Gamestop. Wide market downturns have a caused a rise in popularity of broader market funds on the social media platform. That's why SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY) is among the most popular ETFs on the platform.\n\nInsider Monkey's billionaire database shows that 15 billionaires had stakes in SPDR S&P 500 ETF Trust (NYSEARCA:SPY). Some notable of these billionaires are Israel Englander, Ken Griffin and Ray Dalio.\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 17\n\nAdvanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) has time and again proved that it has the capability to catch up with its competition and do it fast. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) recently garnered a lot of praise from the Wall Street after it revealed new chips that are used to train LLMs. Advanced Micro Devices, Inc.'s (NASDAQ:AMD) Instinct MI300X accelerator and the Instinct M1300A accelerated processing unit (APU) are expected to compete with NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) which has been flying higher and higher amid a wider notion that it dominates the AI chips market.\n\nA total of 17 billionaires in Insider Monkey's database reported owning stakes in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD). Some famous billionaires with stakes in Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) are Ken Fisher Philippe, Laffont and Israel Englander.\n\nArtisan Global Opportunities Fund made the following comment about Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n\"Among our top contributors were Advanced Micro Devices, Inc. (NASDAQ:AMD), NU Holdings and Netflix. AMD's data center CPUs are used in the cloud service provider (CSP) servers. In addition to the broader secular tailwind from cloud adoption, the company has a performance and pricing advantage over Intel, which we believe will enable it to continue capturing market share. However, the recent stock price rally was due to growing excitement around the company's AI exposure. It will launch its new MI300 graphics processing unit (GPU) chip later this year to compete against the dominant market leader NVIDIA. Similar to its approach that won market share from Intel within the CPU market, AMD's product will aim to provide similar performance at a more attractive price. AMD is already working with Microsoft and Meta, while Amazon publicly stated that it is evaluating AMD's inferencing chips. Using assumptions around the total GPU market size, potential market share gains and price points, our research indicates this could be a $20 billion opportunity for AMD. That would nearly double its revenue. While the company has not historically missed many deadlines, there is execution risk as it works to manufacture and distribute these complex chips at scale, which, combined with an elevated valuation after the stock's strong performance run, led us to trim the position.\"\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 17\n\nAnalysts and investors are watching Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) as they believe Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) would be one of the beneficiaries of the AI boom. Recently, the stock jumped after Citi started covering the stock with a $1,100 price target. Citi said Broadcom Inc (NASDAQ:AVGO) posted strong quarterly results which were helped by AI.\n\nAnalysts at Citi said that Broadcom Inc's (NASDAQ:AVGO) sales from AI infrastructure could double from $4 billion in fiscal 2023 to over $8 billion in fiscal 2024.\n\nClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy made the following comment about Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO) in its Q2 2023 investor letter:\n\n\"While the ClearBridge Multi Cap Growth Strategy has limited mega cap exposure, which has been a recent headwind to relative performance, we own several companies that stand to benefit from the explosive growth in generative AI. These holdings play key roles in building out the necessary infrastructure and helping customers leverage capabilities enabled by this emerging technology.\n\nSemiconductor and software solutions provider Broadcom Inc. (NASDAQ:AVGO), for example, is an important supplier of networking chips that power ethernet switches and routers for connectivity between AI servers. The company sees quarterly revenue from this part of their business exceeding $1 billion in their fiscal third quarter, on a trajectory toward doubling over the course of the year.\"\n\nNumber of Billionaire Investors: 18\n\nEV giant Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is among the most popular stocks on Reddit. Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) is also gaining popularity among hedge funds and elite money managers. Despite concerns around the broader EV industry amid growth issues, Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA) stock managed to gain 128% year to date through December 13. Piper Sandler analyst Alexander Potter recently said in a note that while he believes the EV industry could face challenges in the short-term, his bullish thesis on the industry remains unchanged:\n\n\"While our new forecast does imply a modestly slower ramp between now and 2030, it's important to note that our long-term expectations are unchanged. Specifically, we still think the auto sector will eventually reach 100% EV penetration, and we disagree with the notion that EV demand is approaching exhaustion,\" Potter noted.\n\nAs of the end of the September quarter, 18 billionaires reported owning stakes in Tesla Inc (NASDAQ:TSLA).\n\nIn addition to Tesla, billionaires and Redditors also like Apple Inc (NASDAQ:AAPL), NVIDIA Corporation (NASDAQ:NVDA) and Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT).\n\nHere is what White Brook Capital has to say about Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA) in its Q3 2023 investor letter:\n\n\"The magnificent seven, that underpin the S&P 500 performance, which includes Tesla, Inc. (NASDAQ:TSLA), now comprise almost 30% of the market capitalization of the S&P500. At least three of the seven stocks have heightened downside risk and suffer from already high penetration, weakening end markets, competitive risk, and lofty valuation. They have been remarkably resilient to increased interest rates and the potential for slowing growth. Small and midcap stocks, on the other hand, have been systemically penalized by fears of recession and continue to price that eventuality even as significantly better outcomes have become more probable. Today, it's relatively easy to find attractive investments in this segment.\"",

Diaz's debut, In the Distance, was a finalist for the Pulitzer Prize and the PEN/Faulkner Award. Trust fulfills that book's promise, and then some ... Wordplay is Trust's currency ... In Diaz's accomplished hands we circle ever closer to the black hole at the core of Trust ... Trust is a glorious novel about empires and erasures, husbands and wives, staggering fortunes and unspeakable misery ... He spins a larger parable, then, plumbing sex and power, causation and complicity. Mostly, though, Trust is a literary page-turner, with a wealth of puns and elegant prose, fun as hell to read.\"\n\n-Hamilton Cain (Oprah Daily)\n\nDemon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver\n\n(Harper)\n\n\"I already know: My favorite novel of 2022 is Barbara Kingsolver's Demon Copperhead. Equal parts hilarious and heartbreaking, this is the story of an irrepressible boy nobody wants, but readers will love ... In a feat of literary alchemy, Kingsolver uses the fire of that boy's spirit to illuminate -- and singe -- the darkest recesses of our country ... Kingsolver has reconceived the story in the fabric of contemporary life. Demon Copperhead is entirely her own thrilling story, a fierce examination of contemporary poverty and drug addiction tucked away in the richest country on Earth ... There's the saving grace. This would be a grim melodrama if it weren't for Demon's endearing humor, an alloy formed by his unaffected innocence and weary cynicism ... With Demon Copperhead, she's raised the bar even higher, providing her best demonstration yet of a novel's ability to simultaneously entertain and move and plead for reform.\"\n\n-Ron Charles (The Washington Post)\n\nFinalists: Vauhini Vara, The Immortal King Rao (W. W. Norton & Company)\n\nNATIONAL BOOK AWARD\n\nRecognizes an outstanding work of literary fiction by a United States citizen.\n\nPrize money: $10,000\n\nBlackouts by Justin Torres\n\n(Farrar, Straus and Giroux)\n\n\"Torres's lyrical new novel, Blackouts, these two forms -- erasure poetry and queer history -- collide to create one epic conversation between a pivotal 20th-century queer sexology text and two unreliable queer Puerto Rican narrators ... The supreme pleasure of the book is its slow obliteration of any firm idea of reality -- a perfect metaphor for the delirious disorientation that comes with learning queer history as an adult ... Torres haunts this book full of ghosts like a ghost himself, and with this novel, he has passed the haunting on, creating the next link in a queer chain from Jan to Juan to nene to you.\"\n\n-Hugh Ryan (The New York Times Book Review)\n\nFinalists:\n\nNana Kwame Adjei-Brenyah, Chain-Gang All-Stars (Pantheon)\n\nAaliyah Bilal, Temple Folk (Simon & Schuster)\n\nPaul Harding, This Other Eden (W. W. Norton & Company)\n\nHanna Pylväinen, The End of Drum-Time (Henry Holt & Company)\n\nBOOKER PRIZE\n\nAwarded for the best original novel written in the English language and published in the UK.\n\nPrize money: £50,000\n\nProphet Song by Paul Lynch\n\n(Atlantic Monthly Press)\n\n\"If there was ever a crucial book for our current times, it's Paul Lynch's Prophet Song ... The book is also reminiscent of Anna Burns's Milkman in that it's an important story aching to be told, heavy with the reality it bears. While Burns wrote of sexual harassment, Lynch's dystopian Ireland reflects the reality of war-torn countries, where refugees take to the sea to escape persecution on land. Prophet Song echoes the violence in Palestine, Ukraine and Syria, and the experience of all those who flee from war-torn countries. This is a story of bloodshed and heartache that strikes at the core of the inhumanity of western politicians' responses to the refugee crisis ... Lynch's message is crystal clear: lives the world over are experiencing upheaval, violence, persecution. Prophet Song is a literary manifesto for empathy for those in need and a brilliant, haunting novel that should be placed into the hands of policymakers everywhere.\"\n\n-Aimée Walsh (The Observer)\n\nFinalists:\n\nSarah Bernstein, Study for Obedience (Knopf Canada)\n\nJonathan Escoffery, If I Survive You (MCD)\n\nPaul Harding, This Other Eden (W. W. Norton & Company)\n\nChetna Maroo, Western Lane (Farrar, Straus and Giroux)\n\nPaul Murray, The Bee Sting (Farrar, Straus and Giroux)\n\nINTERNATIONAL BOOKER PRIZE\n\nAwarded for a single book in English translation published in the UK.\n\nPrize money: £50,000, divided equally between the author and the translator\n\nTime Shelter by Georgi Gospodinov, tr. from Bulgarian by Angela Rodel\n\n(Liveright)\n\n\"Mr. Gospodinov...is a nostalgia artist ... His books are preoccupied with memory, its ambiguous pleasures and its wistful, melancholy attraction. He is most drawn to minor and personalized details ... The book flows between the remembered and the purely imagined as easily as it wanders through time ... The novel rambles among elaborations of its fantastical conceit, flashbacks to the narrator's youth, and meditations on the current condition of Europe with no apparent cohesive structure. Caveat lector: This makes for an extremely diffuse and piecemeal book. But the absence of a stabilizing center of gravity is symptomatic of a continent still recovering from the hammer-blows of World War II and the Cold War ... Mr. Gospodinov also grasps the dangers of escapism ... This difficult but rewarding novel concludes with an image of Europe brought to the brink of renewed conflict -- an abstraction that recent events have imbued with the terrible force of reality.\"\n\n-Sam Sacks (The Wall Street Journal)\n\nFinalists:\n\nBoulder by Eva Baltasar, tr. from Spanish by Julia Sanches (And Other Stories)\n\nWhale by Cheon Myeong-kwan, tr. from Korean by Chi-Young Kim (Archipelago)\n\nThe Gospel According to the New World by Maryse Condé, tr. from French by (World Editions)\n\nStanding Heavy by GauZ', tr. from French by Frank Wynne (Biblioasis)\n\nStill Born by Guadalupe Nettel, tr. from Spanish by Rosalind Harvey (Bloomsbury)\n\nNATIONAL BOOK CRITICS CIRCLE AWARD\n\nGiven annually to honor outstanding writing and to foster a national conversation about reading, criticism, and literature. Judged by the volunteer directors of the NBCC who are 24 members serving rotating three-year terms, with eight elected annually by the voting members, namely \"professional book review editors and book reviewers.\"\n\nBliss Montage by Ling Ma\n\n(Farrar, Straus and Giroux)\n\n\"The strangeness of living in a body is exposed, the absurdity of carrying race and gender on one's face, all against the backdrop of an America in ruin ... Ma's meticulously-crafted mood and characterization ... Ma's gift for endings is evident ... Ma masterfully captures her characters' double consciousness, always seeing themselves through the white gaze, in stunning and bold new ways ... Even the weaker stories in the book...are redeemed by Ma's restrained prose style, dry humor, and clever gut-punch endings. But all this technical prowess doesn't mean the collection lacks a heart. First- and second-generation Americans who might have been invisible for most of their lives are seen and held lovingly in Ma's fiction.\"\n\n-Bruna Dantas Lobato (Astra)\n\nFinalists:\n\nPercival Everett, Dr No (Graywolf)\n\nJon Fosse with Damion Searls (trans.), A New Name (Transit Books)\n\nMieko Kawakami with Sam Bett and David Boyd (trans.), All the Lovers in the Night (Europa Editions)\n\nNamwali Serpell, The Furrows (Hogarth)\n\nKIRKUS PRIZE\n\nChosen from books reviewed by Kirkus Reviews that earned the Kirkus Star.\n\nPrize money: $50,000\n\nThe Heaven and Earth Grocery Store by James McBride\n\n(Riverhead)\n\n\"If you think this novel is beginning to sound too nice, too pat, you don't know McBride's writing. He crowds the chaos of the world into his sentences ... McBride's roving narrator is, by turns, astute, withering, giddy, damning and jubilant. He has a fine appreciation for the human comedy ... McBride looks squarely at savage truths about race and prejudice, but he also insists on humor and hope. The Heaven & Earth Grocery Store is one of the best novels I've read this year. It pulls off the singular magic trick of being simultaneously flattening and uplifting.\"\n\n-Maureen Corrigan (NPR)\n\nFinalists:\n\nJamel Brinkley, Witness (Farrar, Straus and Giroux)\n\nElanor Catton, Birnam Wood (Farrar, Straus and Giroux)\n\nKelly Link, White Cat, Black Dog (Random House)\n\nPaul Murray, The Bee Sting (Farrar, Straus and Giroux)\n\nJesmyn Ward, Let Us Descend (Scribner)\n\nWOMEN'S PRIZE FOR FICTION\n\nAwarded to a female author of any nationality for the best original full-length novel written in English and published in the United Kingdom.\n\nDemon Copperhead by Barbara Kingsolver\n\n(Harper)\n\nFinalists:\n\nJacqueline Crooks, Fire Rush (Viking)\n\nLouise Kennedy, Trespasses (Riverhead)\n\nPriscilla Morris, Black Butterflies (Knopf)\n\nMaggie O'Farrell, The Marriage Portrait (Knopf)\n\nLaline Paull, Pod (Pegasus)\n\nPEN/FAULKNER AWARD\n\nAwarded to the author of the year's best work of fiction by a living American citizen.\n\nPrize money: $15,000\n\nThe Book of Goose by Yiyun Li\n\n(Farrar, Straus and Giroux)\n\n\"Eerie and intimate ... Though the literary ruse drives its plot, The Book of Goose is mainly concerned with the lack of personal agency afforded to two very different girls -- and how this shapes their destinies. Both want more than their village can offer, but until they write their book, only Fabienne has some power in her dealings with adults -- because she scares them. When their book's success gives Agnès a measure of control over her future, the friendship takes a stark turn. Not since John Knowles' A Separate Peace has a novel wrung such drama from two teens standing face to face on a tree branch ... In prose shorn of unnecessary modifiers and frills of any kind, Li capably depicts the way a strong-willed sadist can browbeat a peer into subservience.\"\n\n-Kevin Canfield (The Star Tribune)\n\nFinalists:\n\nJonathan Escoffery, If I Survive You (MCD)\n\nLaura Warrell, Sweet, Soft, Plenty Rhythm (Pantheon)\n\nDione Irving, The Islands (Catapult)\n\nKathryn Harlan, Fruiting Bodies (W. W. Norton & Company)\n\nPEN/ROBERT W. BINGHAM PRIZE FOR DEBUT FICTION\n\nAwarded to an exceptionally talented fiction writer whose debut work represents distinguished literary achievement and suggests great promise.\n\nPrize money: $25,000\n\nNight of the Living Rez by Morgan Talty\n\n(Tin House Books)\n\n\"Talty depicts the relationship between David and Paige perfectly -- the siblings clearly care for each other; it's evident beneath the bickering and the long periods when they don't see each other ... The story ends with both mother and son experiencing terrifying medical emergencies; it's almost excruciating to read, but it's undeniably powerful, and, in its own way, beautiful ... Talty's prose is flawless throughout; he writes with a straightforward leanness that will likely appeal to admirers of Thom Jones or Denis Johnson. But his style is all his own, as is his immense sense of compassion. Night of the Living Rez is a stunning look at a family navigating their lives through crisis -- it's a shockingly strong debut, sure, but it's also a masterwork by a major talent.\"\n\n-Michael Schaub (The Star Tribune)\n\nFinalists:\n\nSindya Bhanoo, Seeking Fortune Elsewhere (Catapult)\n\nMeron Hadero, A Down Home Meal for These Difficult Times (Restless Books)\n\nMorgan Thomas, Manywhere (Picador)\n\nJasmine Sawers, The Anchored World (Rose Metal Press)\n\nANDREW CARNEGIE MEDAL FOR EXCELLENCE IN FICTION\n\nAwards established in 2012 to recognize the best fiction and nonfiction books for adult readers published in the U.S. in the previous year. Administered by the American Library Association.\n\nPrize money: $5,000 (winner), $1,500 (finalists)\n\nThe Swimmers by Julie Otsuka\n\n(Knopf)\n\n\"Brief quotes give the text the veneer of nonfiction, and keep the narrative at arm's length, rather than pull you close as fiction often attempts to ... We leave the pool in the novel's second half, and are firmly anchored aboveground with Alice, diagnosed with dementia, and her unnamed daughter ... Otsuka's prose is powerfully subdued: She builds lists and litanies that appear unassuming, even quotidian, until the paragraph comes to an end, and you find yourself stunned by what she has managed ... It's in [the] dissonance that the novel's halves begin to meaningfully cohere ... The puzzling narrative structure makes a kind of poetic sense as myth ... The Swimmers makes an archetypal story wholly personal ... In a time of monotony and chaos, when death is as concrete as it is unimaginable, and when cracks can and do appear in the pool for no discernible reason, The Swimmers is an exquisite companion. Though it doesn't answer the unanswerable, the novel's quiet insistence resonates: that it is our perfectly ordinary proclivities that make us who we are.\"\n\n-Rachel Khong (The New York Times Book Review)\n\nFinalists:\n\nDavid Santos Donaldson, Greenland (Amistad Press)\n\nMorgan Talty, Night of the Living Rez (Tin House Books)\n\nINTERNATIONAL DUBLIN LITERARY AWARD\n\nAn international literary award presented each year for a novel written in English or translated into English.\n\nPrize money: €100,000\n\nMarzahn, Mon Amour by Katja Oskamp, trans. by Jo Heinrich\n\n(Peirene Press)\n\n\"Every now and again, you come across a book you instantly know you must read and will devour ... Oskamp tells their stories with a refreshing compassion -- no poking fun at the former GDR as with Thomas Brussig and co., nor the anger and outrage of Jana Hensel. Oskamp is a curious observer and gleans intimate insights into the lives of the many who carried on as best they could when things got tough. Chapter by chapter, we are invited into their private sphere and bear witness not only to their tragedies, illnesses, and bereavements but also to their triumphs and their great fortitude. Marzahn, mon amour captures a piece of modern German history and brings it right down to the human level.\"\n\n-Catherine Venner (World Literature Today)\n\nFinalists:\n\nAnthony Doerr, Cloud Cuckoo Land (Scribner)\n\nKim Thúy (translated from French by Sheila Fischman), Em (Blackstone)\n\nIvana Sajko (translated from Croatian by Mima Simic), Love Novel (Biblioasis)\n\nFernanda Melchor (translated from Spanish by Sophie Hughes), Paradais (New Directions)\n\nPercival Everett, The Trees (Graywolf)\n\nCENTER FOR FICTION FIRST NOVEL PRIZE\n\nAn annual award presented by The Center for Fiction, a non-profit organization in New York City, for the best debut novel.\n\nPrize money: $10,000\n\nWe Are a Haunting by Tyriek White\n\n(Astra House)\n\n\"A gorgeous novel about loss, survival and community ... The structure of We Are a Haunting is inventive; the switching of viewpoints makes it feel like an extended conversation between Colly and Key ... White's characters are masterfully drawn, and his use of language is brilliant ... This is a stunningly original and beautiful novel of devotion, a book that gives and gives as it asks us what it means to be part of a family, of a community.\"\n\n-Michael Schaub (NPR)\n\nFinalists:\n\nElizabeth Acevedo, Family Lore (HarperCollins / Ecco)\n\nChristine Byl, Lookout (Deep Vellum / A Strange Object)\n\nEskor David Johnson, Pay As You Go (McSweeney's)\n\nJamila Minnicks, Moonrise Over New Jessup (Hachette / Algonquin Books)\n\nTracey Rose Peyton, Night Wherever We Go (HarperCollins / Ecco)\n\nEsther Yi, Y/N (Astra House)\n\nLOS ANGELES TIMES BOOK PRIZE\n\nRecognizes outstanding literary works as well as champions new writers.\n\nPrize money: $1,000\n\n(ART SEIDENBAUM AWARD FOR FIRST FICTION)\n\nThe Return of Faraz Ali by Aamina Ahmad\n\n(Riverhead)\n\n\"With each character's journey, author Ahmad explores the multifaceted nature of longing and loss and what the loneliness they engender is all for. This novel has everything a reader could ask for: a sizzling, noirlike plot; political intrigue juxtaposed with a rich intergenerational family saga; capacious, conflicted characters, including women who may be marginalized by society but are masters of their own narratives; and sublime sentences. A debut novelist, Ahmad manages this complexity seamlessly ... A feat of storytelling not to be missed.\"\n\n-Kirkus\n\nFinalists:\n\nMaayan Eitan, Love (Penguin)\n\nSidik Forfana, Stories from the Tenants Downstairs (Scribner)\n\nOscar Hokeah, Calling for a Blanket Dance (Algonquin)\n\nMorgan Thomas, Manywhere (Picador)\n\n(FICTION)\n\nSolenoid by Mircea Cărtărescu, tr. Sean Cotter\n\n(Deep Vellum)\n\n\"...a novel made from other novels, a meticulously borrowed piece of hyperliterature. Kleist's cosmic ambiguity, the bureaucratic terror of Kafka, the enchantments of García Márquez and Bruno Schulz's labyrinths are all recognizable in Cărtărescu's anecdotes, dreams and journal entries. That fictive texture is part and parcel of the novel's sense of unreality, which not only blends the pedestrian and the bizarre, but also commingles many features of the literary avant-garde. Although the narrator himself is largely critical of literature ... he also affirms the possibility inherent in the 'bitter and incomprehensible books' he idolizes. In this way, he plays both critic and apologist throughout, a delicious dialectic whose final, ravishing synthesis exists in the towering work of Solenoid itself.\"\n\n-Dustin Illingsworth (The New York Times Book Review)\n\nFinalists:\n\nAnna Dorn, Exalted (Unnamed Press)\n\nJames Hannaham, Didn't Nobody Give a Shit What Happened to Carlotta (Little, Brown and Company)\n\nJamil Jan Kochai, The Haunting of Hajji Hotak and Other Stories (Viking)\n\nFernanda Melchor (translated from Spanish by Sophie Hughes), Paradais (New Directions)\n\nEDGAR AWARD\n\nPresented by the Mystery Writers of America, honoring the best in crime and mystery fiction.\n\n(BEST NOVEL)\n\nNotes on an Execution by Danya Kukafka\n\n(William Morrow and Company)\n\n\"... poetic and mesmerizing ... It's an impossible weight for a mother to imagine, but Kukafka handles it with grace and empathy and terrible, enduring beauty ... a victim-forward narrative that is a relief to read after years of serial killer hagiography. It's also no less thrilling ... a career-defining novel -- powerful, important, intensely human, and filled with a unique examination of tragedy, one where the reader is left with a curious emotion: hope.\"\n\n-Tod Goldberg (USA Today)\n\nFinalists:\n\nJohn Darnielle, Devil House (MCD)\n\nGabino Iglesias, The Devil Takes You Home (Mulholland Books)\n\nNita Prose, The Maid (Ballantine)\n\nKellye Garrett, Like a Sister (Mulholland Books)\n\nChuck Hogan, Gangland (Grand Central Publishing)\n\n(BEST FIRST NOVEL)\n\nDon't Know Tough by Eli Cranor\n\n(Soho Crime)\n\n\"Don't Know Tough takes the adage of 'Faith, Family, and Football' and reveals it to be a vicious canard, or at least a decent cover for the common failings of god and men, the violence on the field an acceptable proxy for the violence that exists behind closed doors. A major work from a bright, young talent.\"\n\n-Tod Goldberg (USA Today)\n\nFinalists:\n\nErin E.

F. Kuang\n\n(Harper Voyager)\n\n\"Babel has earned tremendous praise and deserves all of it. It's Philip Pullman's The Golden Compass by way of N.K. Jemisin's The Fifth Season: inventive and engaging, passionate and precise. Kuang is fiercely disciplined even when she's playful and experimental: In an author's note, she invites readers to 'remind yourself this is a work of fiction' before proceeding to footnote the text with the vicious hindsight of a historian. Like the silver bars at its heart -- like empires and academic institutions both -- Babel derives its power from sustaining a contradiction, from trying to hold in your head both love and hatred for the charming thing that sustains itself by devouring you.\"\n\n-R. F. Kuang (The New York Times Book Review)\n\nFinalists:\n\nTravis Baldree, Legends & Lattes (Tor Books)\n\nNicola Griffith, Spear (Tordotcom)\n\nT. Kingfisher, Nettle & Bone (Tor Books)\n\nTamsyn Muir, Nona the Ninth (Tordotcom)\n\nRay Nayler, The Mountain in the Sea (MCD)\n\nHUGO AWARD\n\nAwarded for the best science fiction or fantasy story of 40,000 words or more published in English or translated in the prior calendar year.\n\nNettle & Bone by T. Kingfisher\n\n(Tor Books)\n\n\"... clever and bold-hearted ... Marra's hard-fought journey from third-string princess to hero will delight fantasy readers. Kingfisher's signature offbeat humor remains as entertaining as ever, and her treatment of domestic abuse is filled with compassion and dignity. This rollicking feminist fairy tale is filled with redemption, community and courage, its dark passages the road to a satisfyingly uplifting endgame.\"\n\n-Jaclyn Fulwood (Shelf Awareness)\n\nFinalists:\n\nJohn Scalzi, The Kaiju Preservation Society (Tor Books)\n\nTravis Baldree, Legends & Lattes (Tor Books)\n\nTamsyn Muir, Nona the Ninth (Tordotcom)\n\nSilvia Moreno-Garcia, The Daughter of Doctor Moreau (Del Rey Books)\n\nMary Robinette Kowal, The Spare Man (Tor Books)\n\nBRAM STOKER AWARD\n\nPresented by the Horror Writers Association for \"superior achievement\" in horror writing for novels.\n\nThe Devil Takes You Home by Gabino Iglesias\n\n(Mulholland Books)\n\n\"... riveting ... a barrio noir that invites readers to consider the depths of darkness in this world, its material effects, and the cycles of violence we both willingly and perforce enter into ... written in both English and Spanish -- the former outweighs the latter, and any Spanish dialogue too important to the plot or mood is translated -- and takes readers on a journey to hell and back. Whether hell is the American racism, the Mexican cartel industry, Mario's grief and increasing comfort with violence, or all of the above, it works ... The mix of religious, superstitious, and supernatural elements add a dimension to the novel that heightens its horror, but also its social commentary ... may not be a cheerful book, but it still allows glimpses of love, moments of connection, and glimmers of beauty to exist. Even if those can't save us, they point toward what, with some effort and luck, just might.\"\n\n-Ilana Masad (NPR)\n\nFinalists:\n\nAlma Katsu, The Fervor (G. P.

        "body": "Amidst the challenges posed by the recent war in Israel on October 7th, this advancement in the partnership marks a significant breakthrough in prenatal care, particularly for patients requiring inpatient maternal and fetal monitoring.\n\nTransforming the Care of High-Risk Pregnant Patients in Times of Crisis\n\nFor over a year, Sheba Beyond has employed Nuvo's remote monitoring technologies and other solutions to conveniently oversee pregnant patients who would otherwise need frequent visits to outpatient clinics. Amid Israel's wartime challenges, Sheba Beyond creatively expanded its remote care initiatives, even de-hospitalizing high-risk inpatients. Drawing on their experience with INVU, Sheba enlisted Nuvo's support to donate additional technologies, enabling the reallocation of critical resources to prioritize treating civilians and the wounded while maintaining exceptional care for pregnant patients.\n\nThe collaboration between Sheba Beyond and Nuvo Group exemplifies a new era in healthcare resilience, showcasing the effectiveness of remote pregnancy monitoring even in challenging circumstances. If these advantages can be realized during times of war, it is reasonable to expect lasting benefits during times of peace.\n\nBenefits observed by Sheba Beyond in remote pregnancy monitoring include:\n\nPatients and clinicians have reported positive experiences with the Sheba Beyond remote hospitalization program. Patients have attributed remarkable improvements in their health outcomes to the program, including one patient who said: \"I am confident that there is a direct connection between my being hospitalized on a hybrid basis, performing all the necessary pregnancy monitoring tests remotely through your monitoring belt, and the fact that my test results improved. I managed to maintain the pregnancy from week 32 to week 37 when the doctors were certain that I would need to be induced at week 34. Continue with your amazing work, and I believe that this service should be provided in every hospital in Israel and around the world.\"",

        "body": "WASHINGTON, D.C. -- The U.S. Department of Energy (DOE), Israel's Ministry of Energy (MoE), and the Israel Innovation Authority held a board meeting on November 21, 2023, resulting in the approval of nine clean energy projects, to receive $9.75 million, under the Binational Industrial Research and Development (BIRD) Energy program. The projects will focus on various areas, agrivoltaics, battery technology, CO2 reduction, energy efficiency, solar energy, and energy storage. The selected projects are:\n\nBIRD Energy was launched in 2009 under the Energy Independence and Security Act of 2007, to foster collaborative research and development projects between the United States and Israel. The program receives annual Congressional appropriations for implementation. BIRD Energy is dedicated to advancing sustainable energy technologies, aiming to enhance economic competitiveness, create jobs, and increase energy security. To date, BIRD Energy has funded over 60 cooperative U.S.-Israel collaborations for a total government investment of approximately $50 million and about $65 million in funds matched by the private sector. Over the life of the program, these investments have leveraged roughly $927 million of private sector investment.\n\nProjects that qualify for BIRD Energy funding must include one United States and one Israeli company or a company from either country paired with a university or research institution in the other country. Partners must present an energy project that is of mutual interest for both the United States and Israel. BIRD Energy then selects the most technologically innovative projects that are most likely to eventually be commercialized and generate a significant impact. The BIRD Energy program provides conditional grants of up to $1.5 million. Proponents of selected projects must contribute at least 50% to the project's total R&D cost and agree to repayment if it is commercially successful.\n\nOver the last eight years, several BIRD Energy projects have reached the commercialization stage, including a nonintrusive, real-time energy monitoring platform designed to reduce energy use, manage sustainability initiatives and improve building operations, a new way to optimize the energy efficiency of the food and beverage industry's compressed air generation and improve the reliability of these air systems, and a flywheel-based energy storage technology that can charge EVs in as little as 15 minutes with a much smaller carbon footprint.\n\nFor more information about the program, see: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=di_14c-ef8",

For a quick overview of such stocks, read our article 5 Best Reddit Stocks According to Billionaires.\n\nMarkets are euphoric after clear signals from the Fed that it is ready to start cutting interest rates next year. Nick Timiraos, Chief Economics Correspondent at the Wall Street Journal, talked about an interesting point in a program on CNBC on December 14. Timiraos said that if we analyze CPI and PPI reports of the past few months, the six-month annualized inflation rate comes out to be a little bit below 2%, which is the Fed's original inflation target. The journalist said that the Fed seems to have \"picked up on that\" important data point and categorically signaled the beginning of interest rate cuts next year. Timiraos believes that this is clearly the beginning of a pivot from the Fed and chances of another rate hike are thin.\n\nJim Cramer, like many other financial analysts and investors, is also jubilant over the Fed's signal. Cramer said that the bears never embraced the possibility that Jerome Powell could \"engineer\" a soft landing. He said that three rate cuts would mean \"smooth sailing\" for stocks.

        "body": "TEL AVIV, Israel--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec 14, 2023--\n\nTeva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd., (NYSE and TASE:TEVA) and Biolojic Design Ltd. (\"Biolojic\"), a biotechnology company that uses computational biology and artificial intelligence to transform antibodies into intelligent medicinal solutions, today announced an exclusive license agreement to develop a potential novel antibody-based therapy for the treatment of Atopic Dermatitis and Asthma.\n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231214673739/en/\n\nBD9 is a dual specific antibody that can block both TSLP (Thymic stromal lymphopoietin) and IL-13, and has the potential to deliver treatment across typically TH2-driven inflammatory diseases, such as atopic dermatitis and asthma. Existing drugs currently approved by health authorities focus on only one of these two drivers of inflammation, and do not respond to pathway dynamics. When TSLP or IL13 is upregulated BD9 can bind to either target with both arms and with high affinity, therefore having the potential to help more patients and improve outcomes.\n\nThis agreement supports one of Teva's key pillars in its Pivot to Growth strategy announced in May 2023, to step up innovation, by enhancing the Company's early-stage pipeline organically and through strategic partnerships.\n\nRichard Francis, Teva's President and CEO: \"Our Pivot to Growth strategy is opening a new era for Teva as we step up innovation and accelerate development of novel therapies in our immunology pipeline powered both by our inherent antibody engineering capabilities and exciting partnerships. Based on the size of the indications and validity of the targets, this collaboration with Biolojic presents an incredible opportunity to bring this treatment to many patients. As BD9 can tune itself to the specific underlying conditions of the disease and potentially help more patients who do not respond to current therapies and improve outcomes for existing responders and thus addressing a large unmet need.\"\n\nYanay Ofran, Ph.D., CEO and founder of Biolojic Design: \"We are excited about the opportunity to work with Teva and bring hope to patients. The potential therapy we designed for Atopic Dermatitis and Asthma is another example of how AI can revolutionize drug development. Biolojic's AI platform allows us to rethink and reimagine what drugs can do. Our platform has already yielded the first AI designed antibody that entered the clinic. As Biolojic continues to focus on developing its internal fully owned pipeline, we are excited that our platform may allow Teva to develop BD9 as a novel therapeutic approach that has the potential to be best-in-class.\"\n\nUnder the terms of the agreement, Teva will receive exclusive rights to develop, manufacture and commercialize BD9 worldwide. In exchange, Biolojic will receive an upfront payment, and will be eligible to receive subsequent milestone payments over the next several years, based on the achievement of certain pre-clinical, clinical, regulatory, and commercial milestones. Biolojic is also eligible to receive tiered royalties in the mid-single to low-double digit on product sales should Teva successfully commercialize a therapy.\n\nAbout Teva\n\nTeva Pharmaceutical Industries Ltd.

The award supports the agency's ongoing Persistent Optical Wireless Energy Relay (POWER) program seeking modernized energy distribution platforms for warfighters via beaming technologies.\n\nThe United States sped capability updates to Israel's F-35 fighters after Hamas' October 7 attack, the top officer in charge of the Joint Strike Fighter program said Tuesday. Lt. Gen. Michael Schmidt, program executive officer for the F-35, declined to identify to reporters the capabilities sent to Israel in the two-plus months following the attack, noting the program strives to keep all nations flying the jet supplied with spare parts and capabilities.\n\nThe British Army has deployed RQ-20 Puma drones in Japan for the first time to support a mortar live-fire training. The event was an opportunity to test and refine the 16 Air Assault Brigade Intelligence, Surveillance, and Target Acquisition and Reconnaissance (ISTAR) Group's unmanned aerial system skills.\n\nThe US State Department has given the nod for a potential $255m foreign military sale of communications equipment to the government of Poland. The Defense Security Cooperation Agency notified Congress of the proposed sale, emphasising its alignment with US foreign policy goals and the national security objectives of both nations within the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).\n\nThe Royal New Zealand Navy is set to receive an unmanned surface vessel (USV) that can run completely on renewable energy. Called \"Bluebottle,\" the Navy's HMNZS Aotearoa is transporting it from Sydney to Auckland ahead of trials in New Zealand. The boat can run on solar, wind, or wave power, utilizing a rigid sail to provide wind propulsion and photo-electric cells on the sail to drive its motor.",

        "title": "Dutch Election: Right-Wing Surge Sinks Once-Dominant Christian Parties",
        "body": "Geert Wilders, Dutch right-wing politician and leader of the Party for Freedom, reacts to results that strongly indicate a victory for his party.\n\nLast month's elections in the Netherlands caused a political earthquake.\n\nLed by the Islamophobic and Eurosceptic Geert Wilders -- often described as the Dutch Donald Trump -- the populist Party for Freedom (PVV) won 37 seats in the 150-seat lower house of Parliament, more than doubling their 17-seat result in 2021. Winning a substantially larger share than the runner-up Labor-Green-Left coalition with 25 seats, the PVV, led by Wilders in singular authority, now has the inside track to forming a government.\n\nThe PVV clearly benefited from the brutal October 7 Hamas attack on Israel, demonstrating that extremism breeds radical responses not only in Israel but also in Dutch elections.\n\nLeft-wing parties continued their decline. In 1998 the Labor Party, Green-Left Party, and non-coalition Socialist Party together received 61 seats. The same parties sunk to 30 seats in 2023.\n\nWilders's election and the rightward shift of Parliament is the capstone not of religious resurgence, however, but of a 70-year process of secularization that has seen faith-based parties decimated amid growing uncertainty about the cost of living.\n\nThree denominationally based Christian Democratic parties dominated Dutch politics from the early 20th century, claiming 76 seats in 1965. In the 1970s, they campaigned under the motto of \"ethical revival,\" advocating a return to Christian norms and values in politics. And from their 1980 merger into the modern Christian Democratic Appeal (CDA) Party until 1994, no government could form without their participation.\n\nIn 2006, the CDA captured 41 seats and returned to power in a Liberal Party-led coalition in 2010, despite its decline to 21 seats. But in this election, it won a mere 5 seats, while the traditionally smaller Christian Union and Calvinist Reformed Political Party obtained 3 seats each. Never have Christians had so little representation in Parliament, with faith and ethics playing a negligible role in election debates.\n\nWilders, meanwhile, appealed to Dutch voters on the basis of \"preserving the Christian character of the nation.\" He campaigned under a slogan of \"the Netherlands first,\" combining anti-Muslim rhetoric with an unreservedly pro-Israel stance. Employing fear-based distortion of statistics on crime, he has called for the Netherlands to leave the European Union, for a halt to accepting asylum-seekers, for migrant pushbacks at Dutch borders, and for the \"de-Islamization\" of the Netherlands with methods that are clearly unconstitutional.\n\nHis version of populist conservatism never refers to personal faith.\n\nWilders has long been a far-right firebrand. In 2008, his film Fitna spurred death threats against him amid widespread criticism for its demonizing criticism of mainstream Muslim religion. At the time, I was in Egypt leading the Center for Arab-West Understanding (CAWU). We partnered with the Protestant Church in the Netherlands's social action arm Kerk in Actie, churches in Egypt, and Cairo's al-Azhar, the foremost religious center in the Sunni Muslim world, to diffuse the crisis.\n\nIn 2011, Wilders was brought to court for his aggressive, offensive, and abusive language against Islam. Though acquitted, the PVV combined his speech with patently false information on Christian persecution in Egypt. But in 2016, he was found guilty of insulting Muslims as a group -- not the religion itself -- and inciting discrimination.\n\nIn this election cycle, he moderated his rhetoric -- but not the PVV platform -- to better appeal to a diverse population. And after his victory, he presented himself as the potential prime minister for all Dutch people while warning that his opponents represented an \"elite\" who are trying to keep him out of government. Except for a brief period between 2010-12, other political parties did just that. It is yet unclear if, this time, a government can form without him.\n\nItalian academic Antonio Scurati has written against a return to populist power politics in Europe. Such politics, he says, are based on reducing complex societal problems to a nebulous enemy, witnessed previously in the rise of Italian fascist leader Benito Mussolini, who at that time blamed all ills on socialists and Jews.\n\nToday, populists around the world focus on immigrants and, often, Muslims. If elections had been held across the continent, it is likely that right-wing parties in other European nations would also have benefited from Hamas's slaughtering of Israelis.\n\nThough Wilders's surge has caused a shock across Europe, the results of these elections were partially expected. Dissatisfaction with traditional Dutch politics has grown exponentially, related to the increasing cost of living and the largest housing shortage since World War II. Migration issues collapsed the previous government, while frustration boiled against the Liberal Party's promotion of the business class over lower income citizens.\n\nWhile accurate polling data about Christian voters does not exist, the PVV populist revolt included the support of Christians who fear further change to cultural values in the Netherlands. However, Marietta van der Tol, head of Oxford University's Protestant Political Thought project, does not believe that Wilders attracted large numbers of Christian votes, despite the attention given him by established Christian networks.\n\nChristian values, however, have long been part of the Dutch establishment, which was deeply religious until the 1950s. Preaching tours by Billy Graham attracted tens of thousands of people to stem the secular tide, and other evangelists followed in his footsteps. Evangelical churches were founded, largely taking from established Reformed congregations, and in the 1960s, the Evangelical Broadcasting Company strengthened conservative faith more widely. But secularization had already settled in as a social trend, and by 1966, one-third of Dutch citizens did not consider themselves to be members of any church.\n\nToday only 34 percent are members, while only 11 percent attend regularly.\n\nBut many churches are uncomfortable with Wilders's victory. This is especially true for those who support ministries in the Muslim world and are unhappy with his culture of polemics.\n\nSamuel Zwemer, a 19th-century American Reformed missionary of Dutch origin, mobilized many Dutch Christians, especially doctors, nurses, preachers, and teachers, to serve in the Middle East. Their work helped establish Protestant churches and addressed the local widespread economic and educational poverty.\n\nOver time, the focus shifted to intercultural and interreligious dialogue. Dutch ministries have realized that churches in minority positions will have no future if they do not engage in building peaceful relations with the Muslim majority. Wilders's polemics, however, do not fit with the traditional inclusivity of Christianity, in which all are welcome regardless of their background.\n\nBut not all is bleak politically. In 2019, the agrarian right-wing populist Farmer-Citizen Movement (FCM) formed. This election, it won 7 seats. Another new party is the New Social Contract (NSC), formed in 2023 from internal splits within the CDA. It won 20 seats. Both parties have clear Christian Democrat roots, and while the FCM appeals only to traditional values -- not Christianity -- the NSC speaks clearly in reference to Christian principles.\n\nBut while the PVV won 25 percent of the vote, 75 percent of the population prefer someone other than Wilders. Migration policies will certainly change to become more stringent, while the next government will have to work hard to address social issues and regain the trust of the wider population.\n\nMany Christians, however, have taken refuge in populist rhetoric, secular conservatism, or religious nationalism -- all of which dilute the biblical message of love, peace, and justice. Neglecting the gospel call to care for one's neighbor, their political choices are accelerating the exit of many from the church. Without a widespread and inclusive revival, Christianity in the Netherlands is expected to dwindle further.\n\nWilders is not the answer. He does not pretend to be.",

        "body": "In a recent discussion hosted by the Regional Organization for Peace, Economics and Security (ROPES), a nonprofit aiming for regional Arab-Israeli peace, Sheikh Abdulaziz bin Mubarak Al Khalifa, a senior Bahraini envoy and former ambassador to the UK, affirmed the endurance of the Abraham Accords despite the ongoing Gaza conflict. Al Khalifa emphasized the importance of consistency in foreign relations, stating that Bahrain would not sever ties with Israel due to the current government's actions or public sentiment unless there was an overwhelming majority against it.\n\nAt the ROPES event, topics like global anti-Semitism, Iranian influence, and the future of the Abraham Accords were discussed. Al Khalifa asserted that widespread hatred of Jews, as seen on some US and European campuses, is not present in the Arab world, even in religious countries like Saudi Arabia.\n\nThe panel also discussed the necessity of broadening the Abraham Accords to face security threats and the importance of the next generation of leaders in shaping a postwar Middle East. Al Khalifa and other speakers at the event pointed out that most Palestinians and Arabs, apart from extremist groups, desire a two-state solution, putting the responsibility on the Israeli government to work toward peace and security.\n\nFor more details on these insightful discussions and the future of Middle East peace, read the full article on The Media Line's website.",

        "title": "Israel is a land of heroes",
        "body": "For thousands of years, Israel has been known as the land of our forefathers, the land of the Bible, and the land of God -- yet what has been made inspiringly clear to everyone over the past eight weeks, is that this miraculous country is inhabited by a land of heroes.\n\nThroughout my life, I have been studying and finding life lessons from the heroes of Israel from thousands of years ago -- King David, Deborah, Joshua, and Caleb. From the time I was a baby, I was raised on stories of the Zionist champions from this past century -- Golda Meir, Yoni Netanyahu, and the countless other Israelis who worked to make the modern Jewish state what it is today.\n\nAnd sadly, in the past few years, I have been hearing people ask the same questions on the future of Israel, with a sense of despair:\n\n\"Where have the visionary Ben Gurion's of Israel gone?\"\n\n\"Does the younger generation understand what our older heroes knew: that we must be willing and able to transition from enjoying coffee in Tel Aviv, to fighting on the battlefield for our survival, in a moment's notice?\"\n\nIn the past 10 years, it has become clear that the benefits of being the only Western democracy in the Middle East come with challenges as well.\n\nOn the one hand, Israel made the coveted list of \"top 5 happiest countries in the world,\" by possessing a national spirit of joy, despite the hardships, which is palpable to anyone who visits.\n\nYet on the other hand, we have all wondered if this next generation -- who hasn't experienced any wars which threatened Israel's existence -- would be able to drop their smart phones, high-tech jobs, and comfortable lives, to crawl in the mud and defend this homeland, if they needed to.\n\nIf this horrendous war has taught me one thing, it's that we have sinned, by being so naïve and blind to the heroism that surrounds us at every coffee shop, in every synagogue, in the cafeteria of every high-tech hub, and in the spirit of every single person -- both young and old -- in this beloved country.\n\nThis past Shabbat, as I read the biblical story of Joseph who heroically saved the people of Egypt from famine thousands of years ago, I looked at my 17-year-old daughter who very soon will be an Israeli soldier, and reminded her that the heroes of this land are not just people of the past. Rather, they are people in the present, who are acting heroically.\n\nHeroes like Keith Isaacson, a South African immigrant to Israel, and the Chief Security Officer for the Eshkol Regional Council, who I visited in the burnt ashes of Be'eri, just a few days ago.\n\nOn October 7, Keith was riding in the bulletproof, shrapnel-proof truck that The Fellowship donated to him a few months ago, when he realized that Israel was under terrorist attack. It was 7:30 am when he found himself driving directly towards two Toyota trucks full of terrorists heavily armed with RPGs, anti-tank missiles, and lots of guns. As they passed Keith's truck in the opposite direction, the terrorists fired dozens of rounds his way. They tried to shoot his tires, but the fortified trucks have special tires that retain their air for a full day after being shot. By sheer miracle, Keith survived.\n\nAs the terrorists fired dozens of bullets at Keith's windshield and windows, Keith alerted everyone in his town and the security establishment, that Israel was under attack. These few minutes they had to prepare before the terrorists reached their city, saved countless lives.\n\nKeith didn't leave the war zone to protect himself, but rather drove to a sheltered area in the heart of the terrorist's onslaught, to help. He ended up organizing and overseeing the army's heroic rescue of thousands of Israeli citizens on the Gaza border.\n\nEight weeks later, he hasn't put down his gun for a second and remains on the front lines protecting this Holy Land and her people.\n\nThe people who he is dedicated to protecting, are people like Riva, an 87-year-old holocaust survivor in Sderot, who is unable to evacuate the Gaza border town, which is bombarded by rockets daily. As I went to the ghost town of Sderot to visit Riva and bring her food, she told me how on October 7 she looked out her window and saw groups of Hamas terrorists, wearing green headbands and holding machine guns, coming at her home from every direction. They were on her lawn, outside her building, yelling in Arabic. \"I was sure I was going to die,\" Riva whispered, with shaking hands and teary eyes.\n\nAs terrorists swarmed her apartment building on October 7, and she saw dead bodies of her friends on the street, Riva simply sat down on her kitchen floor... and for seven hours, she waited to die. \"I sat down so that at least if the terrorists came in, they would shoot me right away, because I couldn't even stand up to run away.\"\n\nBut God's hedge of protection was over Riva that day.\n\nAfter those terrifying hours of waiting, the terrorists moved on... and, somehow, Riva survived when so many others didn't. \"The Nazis almost killed me when I was two years old, but I miraculously lived,\" Riva said. \"At least if I would have been killed by Hamas, it would have been in my own homeland. That's the only comfort I have.\"\n\nRiva is one of 500 elderly who stayed behind in Sderot, preferring to die in her home than live as a refugee. All supermarkets are closed. All neighbors are gone. All streets are empty, besides the army and security officials who protect the elderly and ensure that organizations like mine, the International Fellowship of Christians and Jews (The Fellowship), can safely deliver weekly food and companionship to them.\n\nThe security personnel are selfless and inspiring. But what moved me to my core, was seeing how this heroism has been passed down to the next generation as well.\n\nAmnon, the Chief Security Officer of Hof Ashkelon, might not be as well-known as Israeli heroes Menachem Begin or Shimon Peres, but I can assure you, he is nothing short of a modern hero of Israel. The Fellowship has known this amazing man for 10 years, and security gear -- including bulletproof vests and an armored vehicle -- we provided his team has helped save their lives numerous times.\n\nBut on October 7th, it wasn't just Amnon who was fighting terrorists and putting his life on the line, to protect the people of Israel. It was his grown son -- a high-tech professional from Tel Aviv -- whose heroism literally moved me to tears.\n\nIt was a surreal scene.\n\nIn Netiv Ha'asara, a small Israeli town on the border with Gaza, Amnon and I stood inside a \"frozen in time\" family home that was attacked by Hamas terrorists on October 7th. The holes in the living room walls showed where the grenades exploded, the huge black footprint left by the terrorists who kicked in the door was a wound to the heart, and the charred ceiling was testimony to the destruction that ensued.\n\nThe broken glass on the family photos of the two little smiling children, coupled with the scorched schoolbags on the floor ... made me desperately aware of the battle that was fought in the exact location where I was standing.\n\nWe stood in silence because the gut-wrenching scene spoke for itself.\n\nAnd then, after a few long minutes, Amnon looked at me, took out his phone, and played me three voice messages from October 7th, which brought me to my knees.\n\nThe first message was sent around 7:00 am. \"Dad, I just heard about the terrorist invasion. I'm leaving Tel Aviv now on my way to you. I'll be by your side very soon to help you protect the people.\"\n\nThe second message came less than an hour later, in a strong - yet stressed - voice: \"I'm sorry, Dad, I'm not coming to the small town which you're defending, but instead I'm going straight to Sderot, where there are even more terrorists who are executing women and children. I need to try to help them first. I'm sorry, Dad, but you're on your own.\"\n\nAnd, an hour later, Amnon got the third message from his son. \"Dad, I have been shot. I have two bullets in my chest. I'm going to try to get to the hospital, but there are terrorists everywhere. I don't know if I'll be alive in another half hour, so I want you to know I love you and I'm proud of you. Keep fighting and protecting this land.\"\n\nWith tears streaming down my face, I asked how he responded. Amnon hugged me and played me the voicemail he sent his son in response.\n\n\"My son, I'm proud of you. Be strong. As soon as the people in my town are safe and the terrorists are gone, I'll come be with you.\"\n\nThankfully, both these heroes survived that awful day.\n\nLike so many Israelis on October 7 and every day since, both of them voluntarily put themselves between the terrorists and others, with little regard for their own safety. They have one selfless and holy objective: \"Keep fighting and protecting this land.\" And indeed, they do that job heroically.\n\nAs I traveled to southern Israel to see the destruction caused by Hamas, I prepared myself for the horrific things I would see and hear -- and I will, in fact, never forget the scenes I witnessed and stories I was told.\n\nBut what I came away with was a renewed awe for the humble and heroic defenders of Israel, who might not have books written about them or buildings in their name, but live a life of meaning and courage, the likes of which this modern world has never seen.\n\nIsrael experienced a tragedy, which will stay with us for generations. Yet, we are not a defeated people. We are not a group of victims. But rather, we are a land of heroes.\n\nThe entire country of Israel has unified -- despite our political, religious, and cultural differences -- to recognize that we are not fighting an enemy that is thousands of miles away, but rather an enemy who is unapologetically bent on our destruction, less than half a mile away from our children's bedrooms.\n\nAnd we have mobilized, together -- from the young to the old -- to learn from our biblical heroes and our national; and write a new and modern Israel story, that speaks of strength, faith, and victory.\n\nAm I scared for the future of Israel? I look around me, and the answer is a definitive no.",

        "title": "Archbishop Lori's Homily: Second Sunday of Advent; Afro Community Mass - Archdiocese of Baltimore",
        "body": "It is a pleasure and an honor to gather with you as we celebrate this Holy Mass with all of you, members of the Archdiocese of Baltimore, who come from various countries in Africa either directly or by heritage. You hail from Nigeria and Cameroon, from Kenya, Uganda, and Ghana, as well as Gambia, Benin Republic, Congo, Liberia, Siera Leone, Burkina Faso. You represent the rich heritage and the vibrant Catholicism of these African countries, and your growing presence in the Archdiocese is a sign of hope and cause for joy. And what a grace and joy it is for me, as your archbishop, to witness how, in the diversity of your languages, histories, and cultures, you come together as one, members of Body of Christ, celebrating one Lord, one faith, one baptism, united in one faith, one hope, and in the love of one Savior, Jesus Christ.\n\nI thank you for maintaining strong and loving families, for all that you do to provide for your families, for the diligence with which you educate your children, for sharing with them the language and culture of your countries of origin, and especially for your efforts to communicate the Faith to your children. This is not easy to do in our secular culture, and so I want to offer you both my prayers and my encouragement! May the Lord strengthen and encourage you always!\n\nLet me also acknowledge the presence of so many African priests and seminarians, as well as the many women religious from Africa who serve in the Archdiocese. They are Africa's gift to the Church in America and to the Archdiocese of Baltimore. For all that you - our priests, religious, and seminarians - do for the Archdiocese, I am deeply grateful and ask the Lord to bless you and your ministries abundantly.\n\nThe Experience of Exile\n\nLet us turn now to the Word of God for the Second Sunday of Advent, asking the Lord to light our path in this present moment and in the future. And we begin with the reading from Isaiah the prophet.\n\nIsaiah was addressing the people of Israel who were exiled from their homeland, taken captive by the Babylonian empire and King Nabuchodonosor. No longer could the Chosen People worship at the temple in Jerusalem. In a foreign land, it was difficult for them to celebrate their feast days, to speak their language, to sing their songs. Psalm 137 is a lament for the sorry state in which the Israelites found themselves: \"How could we sing a song of the Lord in a foreign land?\" they asked.\n\nTo them, Isaiah spoke words of consolation. He tells them that their sins are forgiven that the days of their captivity are coming to an end, that God is coming to deliver them and lead them to himself. \"Like a shepherd he feeds his flock,\" says Isaiah to the beleaguered Israelites; \"in his arms he gathers the lambs, carrying them in his bosom, and leading the ewes with care...\"\n\nAs we all know, people emigrate from one country to another for various reasons. Sometimes they do so because of political oppression and physical danger. Sometimes because economic opportunity is lacking. Sometimes for education and career advancement. Sometimes to live with loved ones who have already emigrated. For these and other reasons, people leave behind their homelands. Yet, even when they make a new and secure home in another country, emigrants can still feel as though they are in exile. I think of my grandfather who emigrated from Sicily at the turn of the last century. He and his wife raised a wonderful family; they worked hard and did well; but to the end of his days, my grandfather missed the land from which he came. Perhaps this is part of your experience.\n\nMay God's Word, spoken through the prophet Isaiah, encourage you as you continue to make your home here in the Archdiocese of Baltimore. May you always find this to be a congenial, welcoming home where you and your families can indeed observe your customs, speak your language, and practice your faith - and continue greatly to contribute to the vitality of the nation's oldest archdiocese, an archdiocese that has always been home to those who have come from afar. This is my hope and prayer, as your pastor!\n\nOur True and Common Homeland\n\nBut the message of Advent runs even deeper. As we listen to Isaiah's successor, John the Baptist, we are called to leave behind the captivity of sin and the alienation from God and from one another that sin produces. As Psalm 62 proclaims, \"Only in God is my soul at rest!\" Only in the Lord are you and I truly \"at home\" - wherever we come from, whatever language we speak, whatever circumstances we're in.\n\nThe message of Advent is that God has come in search of us. He sent his Son to become one of us, to share our life fully, to proclaim the Good News, to heal the sick, to raise the dead, and though sinless, to die for our sins, our alienation from God and one another. This is the Good News that John the Baptist proclaims anew to you and me as we prepare to celebrate the birth of our Savior at Christmas. Just as we expect a welcoming church and a welcoming culture, so too we should pray earnestly during Advent for a mind and heart and spirit that is truly welcoming to the Lord. We should pray for a heart that is smooth and level highway for the Lord to come into our lives anew, to forgive our sins, to enable us to grow in holiness, to make us his followers and active members of his Body the Church.\n\nSo let us prepare a way for the Lord - by forgiving any who have wronged us, seeking the forgiveness of any we have wronged, by making a good confession of our sins during Advent, by praying every day so as to understand and so to eradicate whatever obstacles we may put in the way of the Lord as he comes to us. Let us buy gifts for one another but always remember the poor all around us. And if we observe this season of grace wholeheartedly, our hearts will rejoice as Jesus our shepherd comes among us, the shepherd who feeds us, his flock, with the Eucharist, the shepherd who gathers us, his lambs, into the arms of the Church, the shepherd who carries us, his people, close to his Sacred Heart, the shepherd who leads us, his ewes, to the pastures of his love and mercy.",

        "title": "Ramaswamy says SCOTUS should strike down FDA approval of abortion pill",
        "body": "Presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy participated in a town hall with CNN Wednesday evening.\n\nRepublican presidential candidate Vivek Ramaswamy said Wednesday that he hopes the U.S. Supreme Court will overturn the Food and Drug Administration's (FDA) approval of the abortion pill.\n\nRamaswamy appeared in Des Moines, Iowa for a CNN town hall, where anchor Abby Phillip asked him about the Supreme Court's decision to hear a case that could potentially restrict access nationwide to the abortion drug Mifepristone. Ramaswamy said the case is less about abortion and more about administrative law and the FDA approval process, arguing the agency exceeded its authority by approving mifepristone in 2000.\n\n\"It's my opinion -- it's the Supreme Court's that'll matter, but I'm pretty sure they're going to come down right where I am on this -- that the FDA exceeded its statutory authority in using an emergency approval to approve something that doesn't fit Congress' criteria for what actually counts as an emergency approval,\" Ramaswamy told voters at the town hall.\n\nThe Supreme Court on Wednesday agreed to consider appeals from the Biden administration and drug manufacturer Danco defending several actions by the FDA intended to make it easier to acces and use mifepristone in the wake of overturning Roe v. Wade last year.\n\nWATCH: RAMASWAMY'S TOP MOMENTS ON DEI, IMMIGRATION, TAX REFORM, JAN.6 AT CNN TOWN HALL: 'THIS IS IMPORTANT\n\nIn overturning Roe v. Wade in June 2022, the Supreme Court ruled in Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization that the U.S. Constitution does not guarantee the right to an abortion and that the matter should be decided by the states. In the aftermath, 14 states have banned abortion at all stages of pregnancy, with some exceptions, and two others have banned abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detected, which is around six weeks of gestation.\n\nMifepristone, known by the brand name Mifeprex, is a pill taken with misoprostol in a two-drug regimen that first deprives an unborn baby of hormones it needs to stay alive and then causes cramps and contractions to expel the dead fetus from the mother's womb. This process is sometimes referred to as a medication abortion or, by critics, as a chemical abortion.\n\nAccording to Danco, more than 5 million women have used Mifeprex in the United States since the FDA approved its use in 2000. The popular drug is 97% effective in terminating early pregnancy, although the company says 3% of women who take it will require surgical intervention for ongoing pregnancy, heavy bleeding, incomplete expulsion or other reasons such as patient request.\n\nWATCH: DESANTIS' TOP MOMENTS ON ISRAEL, IMMIGRATION, TRUMP AND HALEY AT CNN TOWN HALL: 'AN EASY ANSWER'\n\nPro-life doctors, represented by the Alliance Defending Freedom, have challenged FDA approval of mifepristone on the grounds that the agency inappropriately expedited the drug's approval with mixed success in lower courts.\n\nThe Biden administration and the maker of the drug are asking the high court to reverse an appellate ruling that would cut off access to the drug through the mail and impose other restrictions, even in states where abortion remains legal. The restrictions include shortening from the current 10 weeks to seven weeks the time during which mifepristone can be used in pregnancy. The nine justices rejected a separate appeal from abortion opponents who challenged the FDA's initial approval of mifepristone as safe and effective in 2000.\n\nRamaswamy said the case is a \"symptom\" of \"what's going on in the administrative state.\"\n\nTRUMP HOLDS MASSIVE LEAD IN IOWA 5 WEEKS FROM CAUCUSES THAT KICK OFF GOP RACE: POLL\n\n\"The people who we elect to run the government, they're not even the ones who actually run the government right now. It's the bureaucrats in those three letter agencies that are pulling the strings today,\" he said at the town hall.\n\nRamaswamy said that if voters disagree with his position, they should turn to the \"Democratic process\" and expand abortion access \"through the front doors of Congress,\" pledging that if he's elected president he will \"rescind those unconstitutional federal regulations that Congress never actually passed.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn a statement, White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre said that overturning the FDA's decisions on the abortion pill \"threatens to undermine the FDA's scientific, independent judgment and would reimpose outdated restrictions on access to safe and effective medication abortion.\"\n\n\"This Administration will continue to stand by FDA's independent approval and regulation of mifepristone as safe and effective. As the Department of Justice continues defending the FDA's actions before the Supreme Court, President Biden and Vice President Harris remain firmly committed to defending women's ability to access reproductive care,\" she said.\n\nFox News Digital's Danielle Wallace contributed to this report.",

        "title": "Haley Backers' Spending Surges in Republican's Last-Ditch White House Bid",
        "body": "By Jason Lange, Alexandra Ulmer and Gram Slattery\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Nikki Haley's deep-pocketed allies have turbo-charged spending on her presidential bid in recent weeks, a last-ditch effort to boost her chances against frontrunner Donald Trump in party nomination contests that start next month.\n\nThe SFA Fund Inc, a pro-Haley super PAC funded by business titans including former WhatsApp CEO Jan Koum, has spent over $20 million on ads and mailings backing her White House run in the nearly three months since her breakout performance in a Sept. 27 Republican debate, according to a Reuters analysis of its financial disclosures to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nThe spending was higher than that of any other super PAC during the period and a major increase from the $14 million that SFA Fund spent backing Haley, a former South Carolina governor who served as U.N. ambassador under Trump, in the three months before the debate.\n\nIn both periods, SFA Fund's outlays have been more than double the reported spending by the biggest pro-Trump super PAC, which is known as MAGA Inc. Super PACs are allowed to raise and spend unlimited sums supporting candidates but are not allowed to coordinate activity with the candidates they back.\n\nThe wave of pro-Haley spending is a sign of resistance from wealthy donors to what many - including top party officials - see as Trump's inevitable clinching of the Republican nomination to face incumbent President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the Nov. 5 2024 presidential election.\n\n\"What remains to be seen - and what GOP elected officials seem skeptical about - is whether that extra money will win her any primaries against Trump, let alone the nomination,\" said Michael Robinson Byrd, a professional Republican fundraiser who is unaffiliated in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe pro-Haley spending is overwhelming concentrated in Iowa and New Hampshire, which hold the first two Republican nomination contests in January, said Mark Harris, the SFA Fund's chief strategist.\n\n\"We're going to continue to spend heavily in those states,\" Harris said.\n\nKOCH SUPPORT\n\nAnother pro-Haley super PAC known as AFP Action, which is led by billionaire Charles Koch, has spent more than $11 million since the debate. That spending has largely been on ads attacking Trump and Democratic incumbent Joe Biden but recently it has spent heavily on digital ads supporting Haley.\n\nHaley's poll numbers have risen throughout the spending surge and her solid performances in Republican debates, including the Sept. 27 event when she delivered aggressive but nuanced answers on healthcare, education and relations with China.\n\nBut Trump still dominates the contest.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll that closed on Monday showed Haley and another Republican hopeful, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, tied for second place with 11% of Republican support each. Trump, who has skipped the Republican candidates debates, towered above them with 61%.\n\nThe SFA Fund has so far reported raising nearly $19 million in the first half of this year, with most of the money coming from a handful of business executives. It isn't due to report more recent fundraising until January but has filed dozens of reports on expenditures.\n\nThe Trump and Haley campaigns have so far reported numbers to the Federal Election Commission on spending and fundraising through the third quarter of this year, when Trump spent $9.5 million and Haley $3.5 million.\n\n'IT DOESN'T MATTER'\n\nMAGA Inc, the main pro-Trump super PAC which started the year with $54 million in the bank, has focused much of it's spending attacking DeSantis, the Florida Republican candidate, rather than Haley, despite her recent rise in opinion polls.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, spokeswoman for MAGA Inc, acknowledged that the pro-Haley effort was \"raking in money\" but dismissed her chances of upsetting Trump. \"It doesn't matter how much she raises,\" Leavitt said.\n\nMany of the SFA Fund's ads have focused on Haley's pledges to support Israel and confront China. The ads sometimes take swipes at DeSantis but and have not directly criticized Trump.\n\nAFP Action's ads, however, tell voters Trump will lose to Biden by turning off independents and supercharging Democrats. The group, part of a network of Koch-controlled groups that is one of America's most influential conservative organizations, endorsed Haley on Nov. 28.\n\nSince then it has spent more than $4 million on digital adds and efforts to canvass voters in the early-voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, as well as in Arkansas, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia, said Americans for Prosperity spokesperson Sydney Stubbs.\n\n(Reporting by Jason Lange and Gram Slattery in Washington and by Alexandra Ulmer in San Francisco; Editing by Alistair Bell)",

Memories of a crushing defeat four years ago lingered, where Warner's monumental scores of 154 and an incredible 335 not out played a pivotal role.\n\nDavid Warner's extraordinary shot not only fueled Australia's strong start in the first Test but also became a defining moment showcasing the dynamism and entertainment he brings to the crease.

        "title": "Gateway To Prosperity - Parshat Miketz",
        "body": "In this week's Torah portion, we see the prophetic culmination of Yosef's dreams. Yosef is the first of the two Messiahs - Mashiach ben Yosef, symbolizing material salvation, to be followed by Mashiach ben David, symbolizing spiritual salvation. It is Yosef's role to be the mashbir, the provider, the statesman who will make peace with the nations of the world in preparation for the arrival of Mashiach ben David.\n\nYosef is the gateway through which Hashem showers His blessing of sustenance on the whole world. Using the gift of Divine wisdom, Yosef - Tzofnat Pa'aneach - the decipherer of mysteries, speaker of seventy languages, mobilizes Egypt to prepare for and endure the seven-year famine. Eventually, his father and brothers find their way to Egypt and enjoy the Divine sustenance, through Yosef, as he had prophesied.\n\nOver 200 years later, we encounter a similar phenomenon - in the Mishkan and, following it, in the Beit HaMikdash. Four main vessels reside in the Holy of Holies and the Sanctuary: the Aron, the Menorah, the Shulchan Lechem HaPanim, and the Incense Altar. The purpose of the Shulchan Lechem HaPanim is to serve as a gateway through which Hashem channels Heavenly abundance throughout the world. According to the Midrash (Tanchuma, Kedoshim 10), Shlomo HaMelech in his wisdom saw \"arteries of prosperity\" radiating out from the Beit HaMikdash, across the world, each with its own unique characteristic. Thus, Shlomo knew where the best place in the world was to plant mango trees, apple trees, cucumbers, tomatoes, etc.\n\nFor almost 1,311 years, from the time of the Mishkan until the destruction of the Second Beit HaMikdash, (briefly interrupted by 70 years of exile in Babylon), this state of material prosperity persisted in Am Yisrael. During this time, people had to work less than two hours a day for their livelihood (the minimum hishtadlut), having the rest of the day free to spend with their families and study Torah. We have many rich people in the world today, but this concept of effortless prosperity across the entire spectrum of Am Yisrael, and through them to the entire world, is unprecedented.\n\nYosef was a living Shulchan Lechem HaPanim; through him Hashem channeled sustenance and prosperity to the entire world. Not only grain during the period of famine but even before that - in the house of Potiphar and as head warden in the prison - he was successful in everything he did. The Midrash (Tanchuma, Vayeishev) relates how everything Yosef touched turned to \"gold.\" He would bring Potiphar a cup of red wine and Potiphar would say, \"Today I prefer white wine!\" Yosef would simply touch the cup and the red wine would miraculously turn to white wine.\n\nHe would say, \"Yosef this soup is already cold!\" and Yosef would touch the bowl and the soup would miraculously become boiling hot. Everything Yosef touched or was involved in resulted in enormous prosperity.\n\nWe are currently celebrating Chanukah. Our Sages say that the chief target of the Greek exile was Yosef; the Greeks tried to eradicate the attribute of Yosef from Am Yisrael.\n\nAmong the many evil decrees that the Greeks imposed on Am Yisrael was that they required each Jew to take a bull's horn and inscribe on it, \"We do not have any part in the G-d of Israel.\" Why specifically a bull's horn? It was because the shor, bull, is the symbol of Yosef.\n\nWhat was it about Yosef that the Greeks despised? The Greeks were great scholars, they were the first nation in the world to translate the Torah. They understood what Yosef represented - Yosef never uttered a sentence without mentioning Hashem's name. How did Potiphar recognize that all his prosperity was due to Hashem? It was because in everything that Yosef did, he mentioned Hashem's name. Potifar would ask, \"What was the tally of today's harvest?\" and Yosef would answer, \"Forty-five 45 bushels in the east field, baruch Hashem!\"\n\nPotiphar would ask \"What is this morning's schedule?\" to which Yosef would reply, \"Be'ezrat Hashem we will be pruning the Cabernet grape vines this morning and composting the field.\"\n\nWhen solving the dreams of royal baker and vintner and the dreams of Pharaoh, Yosef was quick to point out that the solution was not his, but Hashem's. Yosef's very essence was the umbilical association of everything with HaKadosh Baruch Hu. It was this very association that the Greeks were trying to erase, which is why they chose the symbol of Yosef.\n\nThe Shulchan Lechem HaPanim did not exist in a vacuum. It was paired with another vessel, the Menorah. Both stood side by side in the Sanctuary facing the Aron. The Menorah and the Shulchan were a symbiotic pair symbolizing material prosperity and Torah, which are mutually dependent. Without the Torah, radiated through the light of the Menorah, there can be no prosperity. Without prosperity, we cannot physically survive to study Torah.\n\nThe Rokeach (Hilchot Purim, 240) says that the festival of Chanukah is associated with the Menorah, and the festival of Purim with the Shulchan Lechem HaPanim. Chanukah is not a festival of food like Purim (except for sufganiyot and latkes). Some jokingly say that the reason we eat oil-saturated foods, like the sufganiyot, is because after eating one, it burns for eight days!\n\nChanukah is not specifically about the Shulchan (the food); it is about the mix of the Shulchan and the Menorah. The focus is on Yosef, who embodied the symbiotic pairing of the Shulchan and the Menorah. Yosef was the mashbir, the provider of prosperity, who never uttered a sentence without recognition and gratitude to Hashem.\n\nParshat HaShavua Trivia Question: When the brothers arrived in Egypt in search of food, what was the first thing they did?\n\nAnswer to Last Week's Trivia Question: The Yishmaeli merchants who took Yosef to Egypt were carrying perfume, but this was not their normal cargo. What was? Foul-smelling oil and tar (Breishit Rabba 84, 17). Hashem had mercy on Yosef that he would not have to endure the journey with a foul smell.",

        "title": "Haley backers' spending surges in Republican's last-ditch White House bid",
        "body": "By Jason Lange, Alexandra Ulmer and Gram Slattery\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Nikki Haley's deep-pocketed allies have turbo-charged spending on her presidential bid in recent weeks, a last-ditch effort to boost her chances against frontrunner Donald Trump in party nomination contests that start next month.\n\nThe SFA Fund Inc, a pro-Haley super PAC funded by business titans including former WhatsApp CEO Jan Koum, has spent over $20 million on ads and mailings backing her White House run in the nearly three months since her breakout performance in a Sept. 27 Republican debate, according to a Reuters analysis of its financial disclosures to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nThe spending was higher than that of any other super PAC during the period and a major increase from the $14 million that SFA Fund spent backing Haley, a former South Carolina governor who served as U.N. ambassador under Trump, in the three months before the debate.\n\nIn both periods, SFA Fund's outlays have been more than double the reported spending by the biggest pro-Trump super PAC, which is known as MAGA Inc. Super PACs are allowed to raise and spend unlimited sums supporting candidates but are not allowed to coordinate activity with the candidates they back.\n\nThe wave of pro-Haley spending is a sign of resistance from wealthy donors to what many - including top party officials - see as Trump's inevitable clinching of the Republican nomination to face incumbent President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the Nov. 5 2024 presidential election.\n\n\"What remains to be seen - and what GOP elected officials seem skeptical about - is whether that extra money will win her any primaries against Trump, let alone the nomination,\" said Michael Robinson Byrd, a professional Republican fundraiser who is unaffiliated in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe pro-Haley spending is overwhelming concentrated in Iowa and New Hampshire, which hold the first two Republican nomination contests in January, said Mark Harris, the SFA Fund's chief strategist.\n\n\"We're going to continue to spend heavily in those states,\" Harris said.\n\nKOCH SUPPORT\n\nAnother pro-Haley super PAC known as AFP Action, which is led by billionaire Charles Koch, has spent more than $11 million since the debate. That spending has largely been on ads attacking Trump and Democratic incumbent Joe Biden but recently it has spent heavily on digital ads supporting Haley.\n\nHaley's poll numbers have risen throughout the spending surge and her solid performances in Republican debates, including the Sept. 27 event when she delivered aggressive but nuanced answers on healthcare, education and relations with China.\n\nBut Trump still dominates the contest.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll that closed on Monday showed Haley and another Republican hopeful, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, tied for second place with 11% of Republican support each. Trump, who has skipped the Republican candidates debates, towered above them with 61%.\n\nThe SFA Fund has so far reported raising nearly $19 million in the first half of this year, with most of the money coming from a handful of business executives. It isn't due to report more recent fundraising until January but has filed dozens of reports on expenditures.\n\nThe Trump and Haley campaigns have so far reported numbers to the Federal Election Commission on spending and fundraising through the third quarter of this year, when Trump spent $9.5 million and Haley $3.5 million.\n\n'IT DOESN'T MATTER'\n\nMAGA Inc, the main pro-Trump super PAC which started the year with $54 million in the bank, has focused much of it's spending attacking DeSantis, the Florida Republican candidate, rather than Haley, despite her recent rise in opinion polls.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, spokeswoman for MAGA Inc, acknowledged that the pro-Haley effort was \"raking in money\" but dismissed her chances of upsetting Trump. \"It doesn't matter how much she raises,\" Leavitt said.\n\nMany of the SFA Fund's ads have focused on Haley's pledges to support Israel and confront China. The ads sometimes take swipes at DeSantis but and have not directly criticized Trump.\n\nAFP Action's ads, however, tell voters Trump will lose to Biden by turning off independents and supercharging Democrats. The group, part of a network of Koch-controlled groups that is one of America's most influential conservative organizations, endorsed Haley on Nov. 28.\n\nSince then it has spent more than $4 million on digital adds and efforts to canvass voters in the early-voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, as well as in Arkansas, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia, said Americans for Prosperity spokesperson Sydney Stubbs.\n\n(Reporting by Jason Lange and Gram Slattery in Washington and by Alexandra Ulmer in San Francisco; Editing by Alistair Bell)\n\nCLICK HERE TO READ MORE FROM THE GAZETTE",

        "body": "Republican U.S. presidential candidates participate in their fourth debate of the 2024 U.S. presidential campaign in Tuscaloosa, Alabama\n\nBy Jason Lange, Alexandra Ulmer and Gram Slattery\n\nWASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican Nikki Haley's deep-pocketed allies have turbo-charged spending on her presidential bid in recent weeks, a last-ditch effort to boost her chances against frontrunner Donald Trump in party nomination contests that start next month.\n\nThe SFA Fund Inc, a pro-Haley super PAC funded by business titans including former WhatsApp CEO Jan Koum, has spent over $20 million on ads and mailings backing her White House run in the nearly three months since her breakout performance in a Sept. 27 Republican debate, according to a Reuters analysis of its financial disclosures to the Federal Election Commission.\n\nThe spending was higher than that of any other super PAC during the period and a major increase from the $14 million that SFA Fund spent backing Haley, a former South Carolina governor who served as U.N. ambassador under Trump, in the three months before the debate.\n\nIn both periods, SFA Fund's outlays have been more than double the reported spending by the biggest pro-Trump super PAC, which is known as MAGA Inc. Super PACs are allowed to raise and spend unlimited sums supporting candidates but are not allowed to coordinate activity with the candidates they back.\n\nThe wave of pro-Haley spending is a sign of resistance from wealthy donors to what many - including top party officials - see as Trump's inevitable clinching of the Republican nomination to face incumbent President Joe Biden, a Democrat, in the Nov. 5 2024 presidential election.\n\n\"What remains to be seen - and what GOP elected officials seem skeptical about - is whether that extra money will win her any primaries against Trump, let alone the nomination,\" said Michael Robinson Byrd, a professional Republican fundraiser who is unaffiliated in the 2024 presidential election.\n\nThe pro-Haley spending is overwhelming concentrated in Iowa and New Hampshire, which hold the first two Republican nomination contests in January, said Mark Harris, the SFA Fund's chief strategist.\n\n\"We're going to continue to spend heavily in those states,\" Harris said.\n\nKOCH SUPPORT\n\nAnother pro-Haley super PAC known as AFP Action, which is led by billionaire Charles Koch, has spent more than $11 million since the debate. That spending has largely been on ads attacking Trump and Democratic incumbent Joe Biden but recently it has spent heavily on digital ads supporting Haley.\n\nHaley's poll numbers have risen throughout the spending surge and her solid performances in Republican debates, including the Sept. 27 event when she delivered aggressive but nuanced answers on healthcare, education and relations with China.\n\nBut Trump still dominates the contest.\n\nA Reuters/Ipsos poll that closed on Monday showed Haley and another Republican hopeful, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis, tied for second place with 11% of Republican support each. Trump, who has skipped the Republican candidates debates, towered above them with 61%.\n\nThe SFA Fund has so far reported raising nearly $19 million in the first half of this year, with most of the money coming from a handful of business executives. It isn't due to report more recent fundraising until January but has filed dozens of reports on expenditures.\n\nThe Trump and Haley campaigns have so far reported numbers to the Federal Election Commission on spending and fundraising through the third quarter of this year, when Trump spent $9.5 million and Haley $3.5 million.\n\n'IT DOESN'T MATTER'\n\nMAGA Inc, the main pro-Trump super PAC which started the year with $54 million in the bank, has focused much of it's spending attacking DeSantis, the Florida Republican candidate, rather than Haley, despite her recent rise in opinion polls.\n\nKaroline Leavitt, spokeswoman for MAGA Inc, acknowledged that the pro-Haley effort was \"raking in money\" but dismissed her chances of upsetting Trump. \"It doesn't matter how much she raises,\" Leavitt said.\n\nMany of the SFA Fund's ads have focused on Haley's pledges to support Israel and confront China. The ads sometimes take swipes at DeSantis but and have not directly criticized Trump.\n\nAFP Action's ads, however, tell voters Trump will lose to Biden by turning off independents and supercharging Democrats. The group, part of a network of Koch-controlled groups that is one of America's most influential conservative organizations, endorsed Haley on Nov. 28.\n\nSince then it has spent more than $4 million on digital adds and efforts to canvass voters in the early-voting states of Iowa, New Hampshire and South Carolina, as well as in Arkansas, Tennessee, North Carolina, and Virginia, said Americans for Prosperity spokesperson Sydney Stubbs.\n\n(Reporting by Jason Lange and Gram Slattery in Washington and by Alexandra Ulmer in San Francisco; Editing by Alistair Bell)",

        "body": "Thanks to The Kansas City Star for an excellent overview of the credit card swipe fee legislation proposed by Kansas Sen. Roger Marshall. (Dec. 2, 1A, \"Marshall wants businesses to pay less for credit card swipes\") It presented both sides clearly. And, I for one want to thank you for laying it on the line: Marshall's claim that his bill is all about helping \"the little guy\" is pure Washington, D.C., bunk.\n\nTens of thousands of people depend on the rewards programs offered by the credit card companies. The simple truth is that big box retailers want those rewards for themselves. A pool of money now goes to customers who use those rewards to put food on the table and gas in their cars. And the big box retailers want to keep that money. That is the bottom line.\n\nPlease tell our other senator, Jerry Moran, to oppose the Durbin-Marshall legislation and urge Marshall to rethink his harmful position. I urge everyone to help defeat the big box bailout bill.\n\n- Lois K. Spillman, Andover, Kansas\n\nI've criticized Israel's response to Hamas' Oct. 7 attack, but the fundamental Palestinian problem is that many Arab leaders reject peace, favoring destroying Israel. In 1948, 700,000 Arabs left Israel, whereas 15-20 million Muslims and Hindus left India and Pakistan a year earlier. Why don't we have a corresponding Pakistani problem?\n\nThe answer: Muslim countries (except Jordan) have done little to welcome Palestinian refugees or help Palestinians develop economically. Egypt, Iraq, Iran and Lebanon have welcomed more than 4.5 times as many Syrian refugees in the past few years as Palestinians in 75 years.\n\nMany Arab leaders rely on Palestinian suffering to bash Israel. For example, Hamas' plan was that its butchery would stimulate Palestinian civilian deaths. Readers should consider Coleman Hughes' \"The Struggle for Black Freedom Has Nothing to Do with Israel\" at colemanhughes.substack.com\n\nTerrorists hijack commercial airplanes; deploy suicide bombers; offer bounties, martyrdom and special favors from Allah to murderers; and use human shields and hide fighters in schools, hospitals and mosques. Many Israelis care more about Palestinians than some Arab leaders.\n\nI am sympathetic to Palestinians and think Islam is a great religion. Unfortunately, extremists hijacked Islam, and most Arab leaders have served their people poorly.\n\n- Claude Thau, Overland Park\n\nAs an individual with 20 years of experience in post-secondary education, I would like to comment on the student loan situation. Recently, politicians and journalists have given this topic much attention. However, their focus continues to be on loan forgiveness and deferment, rather than asking why these deficits are so large.\n\nPost-secondary education has become outrageously expensive, with room, board and tuition rates rising well in excess of inflation. Educational institutions need to become accountable for the results they produce. Can their students who graduate with huge loan balances secure jobs that pay enough to repay their debts?\n\nThe average six-year student completion rate at U.S. colleges is about 60%. Maybe universities should be evaluated more thoroughly on these statistics, as well as on their job-placement rates in the students' fields of study.\n\nInstead of focusing on temporary fixes to control huge student debt, let's switch the conversation to how our universities can prevent it in the first place.\n\n- Jack Brozman, Shawnee\n\nAs a supporter of the amendment to the Missouri Constitution to restore reproductive freedom, I would like to thank state legislators Mike Moon and Bob Titus for their radical bill imposing murder charges against women who get an abortion, as well as doctors and nurses who assist with the procedure. (Dec. 11, 1A, \"GOP bills propose murder charges for getting abortions\")\n\nTheir absurd bill has made my job much easier. Don't they have more pressing matters to address than this foolishness?\n\n- Lynne Clock, Kansas City",
