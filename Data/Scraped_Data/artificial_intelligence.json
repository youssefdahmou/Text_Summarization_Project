        "body": "Congress is pushing the Central Intelligence Agency and other members of the intelligence community to make a concerted effort to hire individuals with expertise in financial intelligence and emerging technologies, as spy agencies ramp up recruiting efforts across different technological backgrounds.\n\nThe fiscal 2024 intelligence authorization bill, included in the defense bill passed by lawmakers this week, would require the director of national intelligence to work with the CIA, the National Security Agency and the Federal Bureau of Investigation to submit to lawmakers \"a plan for the intelligence community to recruit, train, and retain personnel who have skills and experience in financial intelligence and emerging technologies in order to improve analytic tradecraft.\"\n\nThe plan would be due no later than 180 days after the bill is passed into law.\n\nIntelligence community leaders have been increasingly focused on the nexus of national security and emerging technologies. The 2023 National Intelligence Strategy, released earlier this year, names \"financial crises\" and \"emerging and disruptive technologies\" as the potential causes behind future transnational challenges.\n\nCryptocurrency and other financial technologies also play a central role in cyber activities conducted by hacking groups ranging from ransomware gangs to nation states like Russia, Iran and North Korea.\n\nStacey Dixon, the principal deputy director of national intelligence, recently said intelligence agencies need to be able to examine the \"adversarial side\" of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence.\n\n\"There's several other fields out there that if you can control them, you will have a huge advantage,\" Dixon said Dec. 12 during the Defense Department Intelligence Information System (DoDIIS) conference in Portland, Ore. \"And we are not the only ones out there that they're trying to actually be in that space, to be able to lead in those spaces. But we also know that we got to be able to protect against what others may be able to do.\"\n\nThe report required by the 2024 intelligence authorization bill would include an assessment of whether intelligence officers who have a background in financial and emerging technologies are \"well integrated into the analytic cadre\" of relevant IC elements.\n\nIt would additionally include \"an identification of challenges to hiring or compensation in the intelligence community that limit progress toward rapidly increasing the number of personnel with such skills.\"\n\nAnd it would include a strategy, with \"measurable benchmarks of progress,\" to increase those the number of analysts with those skills by Jan. 1, 2025.\n\nThe NSA is in the midst of its biggest recruiting push in more than three decades, while the intelligence community writ large is considering novel recruitment and retention approaches to attract a younger-generation of officers, in particular.\n\nLawmakers press IC on workforce 'mobility'.\n\nCongress also continues to press the intelligence community officials on efforts to increase the ability of employees and contractors to move between elements of the IC, a concept known as \"mobility.\"\n\nWithin 180 days, the 2024 intelligence authorization bill would require the director of national intelligence to develop and implement a \"policy and performance framework\" to ensure the mobility of the IC workforce.\n\nThe plan should consider processes including human resources, medical reviews and access to different levels of classified information.\n\nOne of the major roadblocks to mobility across the IC is the hesitancy of one spy agency to accept a security clearance determination made by another one, a concept referred to as \"reciprocity.\" In the absence of reciprocity, a spy agency will often put a recruit through another security clearance investigation, leading to delays in the onboarding process.",

Rodriguez, Intel\n\nWorkloads using generative artificial intelligence trained on large language models are frequently throttled by insufficient resources (e.g., memory, storage, compute, or network dataflow bottlenecks). If not identified and addressed, these dataflow bottlenecks can constrain Gen AI application performance well below optimal levels. Given the compelling uses across natural language processing (NLP), video analytics, document resource development, image processing, image generation, and text generation, being able to run these workloads efficiently has become critical to many IT and industry segments. The resources that contribute to generative AI performance and efficiency include CPUs, DPUs, GPUs, FPGAs, plus memory and storage controllers. This webinar, with a broad cross-section of industry veterans, provides insight into the following: * Defining the Gen AI dataflow bottlenecks * Tools and methods for identifying acceleration options * Matchmaking the right xPU solution to the target Gen AI workload(s) * Optimizing the network to support acceleration options * Moving data closer to processing, or processing closer to data * The role of the software stack in determining Gen AI performance",

Memory prices, which slumped this year, have improved in recent weeks, which will help the company deliver higher profitability.\n\nMicron forecast revenue of $5.3 billion, plus or minus $200 million, for the second quarter, compared with estimates of $5.03 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nBusinesses have begun to incorporate generative artificial intelligence into various products and services that has boosted demand for Micron's high-bandwidth memory chips, which are necessary to train large language models that form the foundation of AI tech.\n\n\"Demand for AI servers has been strong as data center infrastructure operators shift budgets from traditional servers to more content-rich AI servers,\" Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, the company expects a loss of 28 cents per share, plus or minus 7 cents, for the second quarter, compared with estimates of a loss of 62 cents per share.\n\nMicron's results reflect the beginning of a recovery in the memory market for memory and flash storage.\n\nRival SK Hynix has supplied AI giant Nvidia. Mehrotra said Micron is in the final stages of qualifying for its HBM3E chips to be used in Nvidia's next generation Grace Hopper GH200 and H200 platforms.\n\nEarnings of major chipmakers Intel and Advanced Micro Devices offered evidence of a recovery in PC demand gathering pace following a post-pandemic supply glut.\n\n(Reporting by Arsheeya Bajwa in Bengaluru; Editing by Shounak Dasgupta)",

        "body": "Though the holiday rush currently sits at the top of most retailers' priority lists, there's another industry-wide event just around the corner: the 2024 NRF Big Show. The annual gathering of retail leaders and innovators brings together over 6,000 of the industry's best and brightest brands to share ideas, successes, and plans for the future.\n\nWhile no one can say for sure what innovative tools and announcements will stem from this year's conference, it's safe to assume that one technology -- AI -- will take center stage, as its potential to shape the industry's trajectory has become increasingly clear over the past year.\n\nIt's no secret that artificial intelligence (AI) has been the technological darling of 2023. When generative AI became available to the masses with ChatGPT in late 2022, all eyes turned to the field's potential to improve business operations. While generative tools and language models certainly have value for retail enterprises, analytics tools have emerged as a primary focus for retailers investing in AI, and this application is likely to emerge as a continued guiding theme at the show.\n\nBacked by cutting-edge processors, real-time analytics is now possible within retail locations, providing deeper, more nuanced insight into operations than ever before. The use cases for deep analytics within retail are near limitless, empowering leaders to visualize performance throughout their supply chains, on the floor, in storage facilities, and beyond. With this in mind, advancements in capabilities, monitoring ecosystems and more are likely to be at the heart of discussions throughout the event, with vendors and retailers showcasing AI-driven tools that support:\n\nNo one can say what the future will bring for retailers, but the topics that dominate the conversation at NRF tend to be a good indication of where the industry is headed. While the event is always a breeding ground for progress, this year's Big Show promises to be one for the history books.",

Memory prices, which slumped this year, have improved in recent weeks, which will help the company deliver higher profitability.\n\nMicron forecast revenue of $5.3 billion, plus or minus $200 million, for the second quarter, compared with estimates of $5.03 billion, according to LSEG data.\n\nBusinesses have begun to incorporate generative artificial intelligence into various products and services that has boosted demand for Micron's high-bandwidth memory chips, which are necessary to train large language models that form the foundation of AI tech.\n\n\"Demand for AI servers has been strong as data center infrastructure operators shift budgets from traditional servers to more content-rich AI servers,\" Micron CEO Sanjay Mehrotra said.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, the company expects a loss of 28 cents per share, plus or minus 7 cents, for the second quarter, compared with estimates of a loss of 62 cents per share.\n\nMicron's results reflect the beginning of a recovery in the memory market for memory and flash storage.\n\nRival SK Hynix has supplied AI giant Nvidia.

        "title": "Brain in a Box: Brain-simulating supercomputer coming in 2024",
        "body": "By Dean Murray via SWNS\n\nThe world's first supercomputer that simulates the entire human brain will switch on in 2024.\n\nCalled DeepSouth, the system is capable of simulating networks at the scale of the human brain, say researchers at the International Centre for Neuromorphic Systems (ICNS) at Western Sydney University.\n\nDeepSouth uses a neuromorphic system that mimics biological processes, using hardware to efficiently emulate large networks of spiking neurons at 228 trillion synaptic operations per second - rivaling the estimated rate of operations in the human brain.\n\nResearchers hope that by mimicking the brain they can understand better how it works and design more efficient AI.\n\nICNS Director, Professor André van Schaik says DeepSouth stands apart from other supercomputers as it is purpose-built to operate like networks of neurons, requiring less power and enabling greater efficiencies. This contrasts with supercomputers optimized for more traditional computing loads, which are power-hungry.\n\nProfessor van Schaik says: \"Progress in our understanding of how brains compute using neurons is hampered by our inability to simulate brain-like networks at scale.\n\nMore from this section\n\nSmall Electrical Shocks to the Brain Could Cut Learning Time in Half Discovery reveals flowers were more diverse a 100 million years ago New research reveals monkeys respond to peer pressure\n\n\"Simulating spiking neural networks on standard computers using Graphics Processing Units (GPUs) and multicore Central Processing Units (CPUs) is just too slow and power intensive. Our system will change that.\n\n\"This platform will progress our understanding of the brain and develop brain-scale computing applications in diverse fields including sensing, biomedical, robotics, space, and large-scale AI applications.\"\n\nProfessor van Schaik believes the system will lead to advances in smart devices, such as mobile phones, sensors for manufacturing and agriculture, and less power-hungry and smarter AI applications. It will also enable a better understanding of how a healthy or diseased human brain works.\n\nWestern Sydney University's ICNS team collaborated with partners across the neuromorphic field in developing this ground-breaking project, with researchers from the University of Sydney, the University of Melbourne and the University of Aachen, Germany.\n\nThe supercomputer is aptly named DeepSouth, paying homage to IBM's TrueNorth system, which initiated efforts to build machines simulating large networks of spiking neurons, and Deep Blue, which was the first computer to become a world chess champion. The name is also a nod to its geographical location.\n\nDeepSouth will be based at Western Sydney University with an aim to be operational by April 2024.\n\nKey Benefits of DeepSouth:Artificial Intelligence: By mimicking the brain, we will be able to create more efficient ways of undertaking AI processes than our current models.Super-fast, large-scale parallel processing using far less power: Our brains are able to process the equivalent of an exaflop -- a billion-billion (1 followed by 18 zeros) mathematical operations per second -- with just 20 watts of power. Using neuromorphic engineering that simulates the way our brain works, DeepSouth can process massive amounts of data quickly, using much less power, while being much smaller than other supercomputers.Scalability: This system's design allows easy expansion by adding more hardware for larger systems or downsizing for portable or cost-effective applications.Reconfigurable Design: Leveraging Field Programmable Gate Arrays (FPGA) allows hardware reprogramming, enabling the addition of new neuron models, connectivity schemes, and learning rules. DeepSouth's remote accessibility through a Python-based front end simplifies usage without intricate hardware knowledge.Commercial Availability: DeepSouth relies on off-the-shelf hardware, ensuring continual enhancements and easy replication at global data centers. This approach overcomes challenges associated with custom-designed hardware, which is time-consuming and costly.",

        "title": "A governance framework for regions competing for Tech Hubs and other new federal investments | Brookings",
        "body": "In October, the Economic Development Administration (EDA) announced the designation of 31 Regional Technology and Innovation Hubs (\"Tech Hubs\"). Authorized through the CHIPS and Science Act of 2022, the Tech Hubs program will make coordinated, place-based investments to advance key national technologies such as artificial intelligence, clean energy, and biotechnology. Originally authorized as a $10 billion program, Tech Hubs only received a $500 million appropriation from Congress. With that funding, the EDA anticipates making up to 10 implementation grants between $50 million and $75 million each in 2024.\n\nTech Hubs exemplifies the federal government's embrace of place-based economic policy. These policies outline objectives, designate funding, and design challenge competitions, but rely on cross-sector consortia of government, university, industry, and community leaders to put forward their best solutions. As we've learned from prior federal challenge grants, the successful implementation of place-based policies demands bottom-up creativity, capacity, and collaboration.\n\nThe architects of the Tech Hubs program are aware of this dynamic, and thus have made leadership and governance a central consideration in the competition. Yet the forms of collaborative governance required to design, finance, implement, measure, and sustain programs like Tech Hubs are still rare -- partly because the United States has not historically funded major place-based programs at this scale. To guide regional implementers, this piece outlines the Tech Hubs program's governance requirements and offers a framework for consortium governance, building on insights derived from the early implementation of a similar program: the EDA's $1 billion Build Back Better Regional Challenge. The framework distills five key components that together capture the multidimensional nature of designing, implementing, and sustaining place-based economic strategies.\n\nTech Hubs are regional innovation ecosystems that leverage multiple stakeholders and complementary efforts to catalyze local economic transformation in relatively short period of time. They are led by complex, cross-sector coalitions designed to be greater than the sum of their many parts. To coordinate and deliver against a shared regional vision, Tech Hubs need a strong governance framework that outlines leadership responsibilities, roles, division of responsibilities among members, decisionmaking processes, policies, and procedures.\n\nThe EDA has underscored the need for consortia to articulate a clear plan for their leadership, governance, and evaluation plans. As a key criterion for selecting implementation awards, the EDA will assess the strength of the consortium's leadership team and regional innovation officer (RIO), as well as the framework and mechanisms the consortium will use to govern its activities, measure progress, build evidence, and continuously improve. Of the 80 points in the competition, \"governance, leadership, and evaluation\" accounts for eight. It also explicitly notes that lead entities -- which will house the RIO -- can apply for project-level funds that cover the costs of administration, management, and consortium-level governance.\n\nAs regions prepare for the next round of applications, they will need to articulate how their Tech Hub will coordinate its consortium and critical assets; how the consortium, its leadership, and its members will measure and evaluate success; and how the Hub will strengthen the culture and concentration of innovation in its chosen geography, among other dimensions.\n\nOne framework for organizing and governing place-based economic strategies is what we call the \"POWER\" framework. Summarizing multiple recent findings, the framework draws on insights from Brookings Metro's examination of the early implementation of the Build Back Better Regional Challenge (BBBRC) and America Achieves' engagements with nearly a dozen Tech Hubs applicants. The framework includes five key components, detailed below:\n\nImportantly, the EDA \"expects projects to advance equity to underserved and underrepresented populations to the extent practicable,\" which means that equity must be considered across all aspects of the governance framework.\n\nLike the BBBRC before it, the Tech Hubs program requires applicants to pull many partners together into a consortium. In fact, the program stipulates that regional consortia must include at least one of each of the five required entity types (institutes of higher education, state or local governments, industry groups, economic development organizations, and labor organizations or workforce training organizations) and encourages two or more firms directly relevant to the consortium's selected core technology area to participate as members. Beyond those mandates, the EDA outlines 13 additional types of institutions -- from national laboratories to community development financial institutions to K-12 education systems -- that could be relevant consortia members. Many of these entities tend to have long-standing trust and ties with historically excluded communities, and will be critical to communicating how consortia building is intentionally addressing the Notice of Funding Opportunity's (NOFO) emphasis on equity and diversity.\n\nConsortia must also designate a \"lead entity\" (the organization that serves as the trusted convener of the consortium to drive a cohesive regional approach and be the program administrator) and a regional innovation officer (RIO) -- the \"single accountable individual\" driving the development and implementation of the region's cross-sector innovation agenda. The RIO is also accountable for ensuring clear and effective governance and leadership of the consortium.\n\nBeyond these requirements, the EDA affords considerable discretion to Tech Hubs applications. In designating consortium members, our view is that the focus should be on the quality of the partnerships and relevance of the members to the consortium's strategy, rather than the quantity of participating members. We've seen wide variation in the number of consortium members by region, including many with over 30 members or up to 100. Given the potential size and efficiency tradeoffs, it is important to differentiate between committed consortium members (diverse entities integral to the success of the Hub strategy) and supporting advisors (important regional partners that are kept apprised of key developments and tapped for expertise and input). With equity a central concern, labor and community voices should be engaged and represented in the planning process and leadership structure, as both consortium members and supporting advisors.\n\nWith core consortium members defined, regions then need to develop a partnership structure that supports the overall Hub strategy and promotes alignment of key stakeholders while maintaining flexibility. This could include appointing a smaller steering committee to drive efficiency, with the mandate to develop and implement the Tech Hub strategy and governance. The steering committee is often charged with setting the strategy and overseeing working groups or advisory committees aligned with the Hub's priority initiatives, which consist of consortium members, advisors, and additional representatives. These working groups should be led by an action-oriented leader capable of driving planning and implementation and responsible for developing and implementing key initiatives within the Tech Hub strategy -- informed directly by stakeholder and community engagement. Hubs may also consider \"task forces\" for unexpected challenges that require quick and coordinated action.\n\nAn illustrative partnership structure is depicted in Figure 1:",

CFOs need work in tandem with other key executives such as the chief information and chief technology officer to establish who owns and is responsible for the data being aggregated -- the position finance chiefs hold as the nexus of information in a company means that \"clearly CFOs have a great perspective on what those data requirements are, how that data is being used,\" Corson said.\n\nThis goes beyond table stakes financial metrics, with CFOs and the finance function increasingly expected to take responsibility for non-financial reporting areas such as ESG, for example, he said. As they look to take a more tailored approach to AI strategy, considering the kind of governance tools and processes they need in terms of risk management is top of mind for finance chiefs -- something that comes in the face of \"a huge amount of stakeholder discourse around the topic,\" Goodhew said.\n\nNew regulations surrounding GenAI, data privacy and cybersecurity are cropping up worldwide as companies and individuals begin to engage with the technology more broadly. In October, President Joseph Biden signed an executive order surrounding the safe and secure development of AI, citing the technology's \"potential for both promise and peril.\"\n\nEarlier this month, the European Union announced a similar provisional agreement on the AI Act, aiming to \"ensure that fundamental rights, democracy, the rule of law and environmental sustainability are protected from high risk AI,\" while also ensuring Europe as an AI leader.\n\nCFOs therefore need to balance their companies' AI and data strategy with how they might need to report under these new and emerging regulations, Goodhew said.\n\nChanging regulations also make it crucial for finance chiefs to take a leading role when it comes to driving that strategy; looking into the far future, GenAI itself could represent an existential threat to the finance function as it exists today, Corson said.\n\n\"Is there a future for finance, in a world where regulators are plugging directly into companies' systems and taking the data out, where natural language allows anyone in the business to really achieve the goals of democratizing data and access?\" Corson asked. In that vein, \"this is where I think CFOs really need to be directing the narrative, they need to be determining what is the future value for finance, and I absolutely believe there is a positive narrative,\" he said.\n\nHowever, it's also important to keep in mind that AI is at the very beginning of its maturity curve. Utilizing the technology in an effective way that creates that positive narrative for finance will likely require a shift in thinking: there's always this risk that \"you apply new technologies to old ways of thinking, and take your new hammer and try find lots of nails,\" Corson said.\n\nAt the same time, true disruption or innovation doesn't come out of smaller pilots or experiments, Corson acknowledged, leaving CFOs stuck in a place where they need to balance risk against innovation. Keeping the focus on value creation can help finance chiefs navigate that challenge, he said.\n\n\"It's really understanding, 'Well look, as a finance organization, what are we trying to become?\" he said. \"What is our vision for five years? And how do we use AI as a tool in that journey?\"",

        "body": "Medium employees, by and large, are readers. It's one of the reasons, if not the reason, we work here. The idea of building a platform that helps deepen people's understanding of the world through quality writing -- lyrical, literary, journalistic, practical, technical, personal, and pretty much any other kind you can think of -- isn't just a job. It's also, if you'll forgive the blatant earnestness, a labor of love.\n\nYou may have heard of something called Artificial Intelligence. There was a headline or two about it this year. How the benefits and costs of that technology will play out remains to be seen. But here's something 200,000 years of the history of our species has already proven beyond a doubt: Human intelligence is pretty cool.\n\nWith that in mind, and with the current human year drawing to a close, we asked Medium staffers to share their favorite stories of 2023. Here, in alphabetical order by last name, are their responses:\n\nI usually read stories related to my job, but I stumbled upon this story. It is about grief as a parent. As it is time to reflect on my reads and pick the best one, I don't see any other topping it as it is the most sincere and touching piece I can think of.\n\n-- Sophie Aguado, Product Designer\n\nFascinating piece detailing how Netflix turned around its declining numbers last year to become the most profitable streaming service. How did they do it? International diversifications (that's why I've been seeing so many foreign movies!), having a mix of original and licensed shows and other tactics mentioned in this story.\n\n-- Nouf Aljowaysir, Product Designer\n\nMarlon takes us into his world as he describes his experience starting the first Black-owned investment firm in Arkansas. He maintains his grit and perseverance despite facing entrepreneurial struggles, racism, and becoming the primary suspect in an international money-laundering investigation. His storytelling is riveting, and I couldn't stop thinking about it for days.\n\n-- CJ Baker, Senior Accountant\n\nThere were many thousands of stories about ChatGPT this year but this humorous series of single panel comics invented by ChatGPT and illustrated by Chaz Hutton captured both the fast progress of AI and the uncanny valley it has yet to cross. Might need an update now that it can draw, though.\n\n-- Buster Benson, Product Manager\n\nI loved this story about the experience of losing a parent. When my dad died, it felt like hitting the fast-forward button on life. Growing up is realizing there's no plan laid out for you. You have to navigate a chaotic world and figure things out. But it's okay for that to feel confusing and hard. That part of the story especially resonated with me, and I'm sure many other readers. I'm always inspired when people share vulnerable stories about things that are universal in human life. Pretty cool that it happens so much on Medium.\n\n-- Alex Benzer, Director, Product\n\nA straightforward article about migrating a large codebase from Dagger to Hilt with clear samples and based on a real experience. (Actually this article saved me, like, a week of work.)\n\n-- Alexandre Bruneau, Android Engineer\n\nA very interesting deep dive into psychology and how video games as a medium are a unique storytelling device.\n\n-- Adrian Castillejos, Staff Software Engineer\n\nThis article is about the release of Pandas 2.0, and it dives into the nitty-gritty of why it's a big deal. Medium's a go-to for tech know-how, especially in data science, always serving up fresh, deep-dive content that's engaging and practical for folks in the field.\n\n-- gustavo [Chavez], Senior Data Scientist\n\nParenting is very important because it has such a direct effect on children as they grow and develop. After I read this article, I realized how much the way we parent really matters. I try to do parenting my best without even knowing my styles and what's missing. The author has done good research on different parenting styles and has valuable insights.\n\n-- Anusha Chenreddy, Senior Software Engineer\n\nA thorough and personal reflection on the living world inside the rectangles we all stare at every day. This piece captures a lot of my own feelings of nostalgia about the handmade web and ends with the nascent optimism I too share for us all to care more about it.\n\n-- Jason Combs, Brand Designer\n\nSmith & Diction, a design studio creating thoughtful brand work, wrote about how they gave perplexity.ai a refreshed brand look and feel. They shared a lot of great thinking and detailed work in their story.\n\n-- Greg Dougherty, Principal Product Designer\n\nA great writeup about Leonard Cohen, his final album, and his final song.\n\n-- Luke Esterkyn, User Services\n\nThere is a wide spectrum of personalities and of understanding why people do or say things, and this is a good starting point in thinking about all of the nuances in how people think, act, and communicate.\n\n-- Elvina Fan, Content Operations\n\nWhen I think about good writing, I think about writing that makes you feel less alone in the world. Writing that puts words to feelings you've always had at the edge of your consciousness but couldn't pin down. Writing that teaches you something you've actually known all along. This essay is the closest thing I've read that matches my own experience with my mom's death and has evolved my processing of it. It's a hard, brutal read -- in the same way that true catharsis requires processing hard, brutal truths in order to achieve it.\n\n-- Carly Rose Gillis, Content Operations\n\nAs a lifelong high-key summer person, who never met a week off he didn't try to overplan, frequently to the dismay of his wife and children, I loved the idea that doing less can be more. It didn't just give me the idea to not be such a Type-A freak. It gave me permission.\n\n-- Jon Gluck, Editorial Director Special Projects\n\nBecause I'm the person compiling this list, I'm going to cheat and add a second choice. Jude Ellison Doyle consistently writes some of my favorite stories on Medium, and this one is no exception -- a brilliant and beautifully written take on a subject you didn't know you cared about until you did. No other writer I know of has such a reliably interesting mix of brains, courage, and heart.\n\n-- Jon Gluck, Editorial Director Special Projects\n\nThere is a new, Southern Gothic Literature movement being created right here under our noses, and it is outstanding.\n\n-- Lou Heneise [Lauren], Director, Finance\n\nI've been getting really into the pop culture corners of Medium this year. I love reading movie reviews that have a point of view, help me better understand the film, and teach me something new. This is ostensibly a review for Nimona, an animated sci-fi adventure movie based on a graphic novel, but it's also a timeline of establishment-defying shapeshifting heroines in fairy tales.\n\n-- Brittany Jezouit, Chief of Staff\n\nThis was an early January read but still one of my favorite pieces published this year. To me, it represents the best kind of Medium storytelling; real and raw, timely and with good humor but touching a serious topic. I first came across it on Twitter (still Twitter at the time!) and it's always really nice for me to come across Medium stories in the wild. I also really enjoyed the community and conversation in the responses of the story.\n\n-- Breana Jones, Director, Product\n\nThis is super wonky and I feel like I'm still digesting its argument six months later, but I keep coming back to this piece by Shapiro, a former Turner Broadcasting executive, laying out the dynamics in cultural networks that drive bigger hits but hollow out the creative middle class.\n\n-- Scott Lamb, VP of Content\n\nThis is one of those \"if you know you know\" Seattle stories about the used clothing that's sold by the pound by the Goodwill. While it might seem to be a story about extreme thrifting, it's actually a sociocultural peek at the humans around the bins.\n\n-- Ariel Meadow Stallings, Product Manager\n\nI loved stumbling across this post, and taking a few minutes of break on a busy day.\n\n-- Perrine [Mondo], Email Marketing Manager\n\nAn in-depth story from Airbnb about how they replaced Epoxy and UIKit with the latest Apple UI framework, SwiftUI.\n\n-- Thomas Ricouard, iOS Staff Engineer\n\nOne of my fav book series is The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy, and it seems that physicist Siegel clearly read the books too. His fun post here attempts to explain why the number 42 is the answer to \"life, the universe and everything\" -- a fitting throw to fans of the books. But he takes the answer seriously and tries to formulate the questions that might derive such an answer. This results in nerdy, readable entertainment.\n\n-- Adrienne Gibbs, Director of Content\n\nIt's human nature to want answers, but there's also wisdom in knowing how and when to live in the question. This essay, by Medium staffer Harris Sockel, explores -- and does -- that with insight, honesty, and beautiful writing.\n\n-- Terrie Schweitzer, Director of Content Curation\n\nWhere else will you find a migration and demography expert nerding out on how many elves, dwarves, hobbits, and orcs inhabit J.R.R. Tolkein's Middle Earth? Nowhere else, probably -- and that's one of the reasons I love Medium so much. It's a platform that gives people permission to ask the important questions, like: What is the population density of the fantastical land we all know and love from Lord of the Rings?\n\n-- Harris Sockel, Content Lead\n\nI've been thinking about how key diversity is to our goal of \"deepening people's understanding of the world.\" On a topic like gender, which is core to my identity (and most people's), it takes someone coming from a very different framework to bring a new lens to it.\n\n-- Tony Stubblebine, CEO\n\nAround the time King Charles III was crowned, Erik Linstrum, an associate professor of history at University of Virginia, wrote this deep dive into why the soon-to-be regent's new role demonstrates how he's less of a modernizer than pop culture would have you believe. In the piece, Linstrum looks back to the end of Britain's colonial era to show how Charles \"embodies Britain's ambivalent attitude toward the imperial past: unable to defend it yet unwilling to part with its glories, either.\"\n\n-- Amy Widdowson, Vice President of Communications\n\nPhotographer David William Reeve has been publishing his series \"Gladiator School\" since 2017. The series documents the memories and photos of survivors and staff from the Heman G. Stark Youth Correctional Facility in Chino, California, before it closed in 2010. I recommend the entire series for its vivid storytelling and the powerful use of photography.\n\n-- Chino Wong, VP, Design\n\nA touching story about a grandpa who loves to draw... snot eaters. 😆\n\n-- Jon Wong, Product Designer\n\nMichelle's my favorite brand strategy writer on Medium. This case study on Van Leeuwen ice cream walks through many approaches to marketing your product outside of advertising.\n\n-- Helena Zhang, Design Director\n\nBecause I get to go last, I'm going to cheat, like Jon did, and give a second answer. In this post, Liza takes us on a delightful (and very visual) journey through the development of her drawing style and influences.\n\n-- Helena Zhang, Design Director",

        "body": "GreyOrange said its Series D will support scaling of its warehouse automation. Source: GreyOrange\n\nAs more warehouses add automation, investors are recognizing the market potential. GreyOrange Inc. today announced the first close of its Series D round at $135 million. The Atlanta-based company said the investment validates its approach to warehouse and retail automation with hardware-agnostic software, certified robots, and sensors.\n\nGreyOrange said it plans to use the growth capital to \"accelerate technology leadership\" and continue its global expansion. The company also intends to further support its fulfillment orchestration platform in warehouses, distribution centers, and retail stores.\n\n\"As we scale our technology and enhance customer experiences and operational efficiency, we recognize that keeping the needs of our customers at the center of our product and solution roadmap has proven essential for our customers' success, as well as our own,\" said Akash Gupta, co-founder and CEO of GreyOrange, in a release. \"This Series D funding amplifies our commitment to leadership within the AI and robotics orchestration space and affirms our thought leadership within this market.\"\n\nSubmit your nominations for innovation awards in the 2024 RBR50 awards.\n\nFounded in 2012, GreyOrange claimed that its focus on innovation and customer satisfaction \"marks a new era in efficient, responsive supply chain solutions.\" The company promised that its artificial intelligence-driven autonomous mobile robots (AMRs) can increase productivity, empower growth, mitigate labor challenges, reduce risk and time to market, and create better experiences for customers and employees.\n\n\"The overall growth seen in the warehouse automation sector will continue to be a strong tailwind,\" said GreyOrange.\n\n\"By 2027, over 75% of companies will have adopted some form of cyber-physical automation within their warehouse operations,\" according to the 2023 Gartner \"Hype Cycle for Supply Chain Execution Technologies\" report.\n\n\"As companies expand their use of robotics, most will eventually have heterogeneous fleets of robots from different vendors performing various tasks, which will require standardized software that can easily integrate to a variety of agents and robot platforms,\" added Gartner. \"These solutions will assign work to the right robots based on the characteristics of immediate and prioritized tasks and communicate with other types of automation (agents) like door or elevator controls.\"\n\nIn addition to AMRs and its fulfillment orchestration platform, GreyOrange provides goods-to-person (G2P) automation, assistive picking robots, sortation and conveyance systems, tote-to-person robots, and \"dock-to-stock\" systems.\n\nThe company said its growth and adoption rate with market-leading Fortune 500 customers prove its \"capability to lead tech transformation in the global supply chain automation space.\" Last week, GreyOrange announced a partnership to integrate its software with Hai Robotics' AMRs.\n\nAnthelion Capital, formerly TD Cowen Sustainable Investments, led GreyOrange's Series D financing. GreyOrange raised $110 million in May 2022.\n\n\"Not only has GreyOrange automated the movement of goods within the warehouse, but the company has also built a network that optimizes how retailers move their goods across their entire supply chain,\" said Vusal Najafov, co-founder of Anthelion Capital. \"Their capability to improve operational efficiency in various settings and their innovative approach in transforming inventory into a more productive asset in warehouses and retail spaces are key reasons for our excitement in leading this funding round.\"\n\nFounded in 2015, Anthelion Capital provides flexible capital and data science solutions to environmentally sustainable companies. In 2018, the New York firm partnered with Cowen Inc. to advance growth as Cowen Sustainable Investments.\n\nThis month, co-founders Najafov and Ewa Kozicz reacquired the firm and rebranded it back to Anthelion Capital. The platform has $1.3 billion in assets, primarily from large institutional investors including pension plans and sovereign wealth funds.\n\nIn addition, GreyOrange said its latest funding round reflects a strong vote of confidence from existing investors such as Mithril, 3State Ventures, and Blume Ventures.\n\n\"GreyOrange's technical and commercial advances reinforce our shared mission to bring game-changing automation and productivity to retail,\" said Ajay Royan, founder and managing general partner of Mithril Capital.\n\n\"GreyOrange's thoughtful implementation of their pioneering technology has earned the trust of the world's largest retailers and logistics partners,\" he said. \"GreyOrange is leading a major shift in productivity, safety, and novel forms of convenience that will benefit hundreds of millions of consumers.\"",

        "body": "The Biden Administration Is Trying to Establish Some Limits\n\nHealthcare providers and payers have joined 15 other prominent AI businesses in pledging to properly build AI models. These organizations include OpenAI, Google, and OpenAI partner Microsoft. As artificial intelligence continues to grow in popularity and capacity with no regulation, the Biden administration is trying to establish some limits on it. According to a White House official, twenty-eight healthcare businesses, including CVS Health, have agreed to accept a set of voluntary obligations that U.S. President Joe Biden has proposed to keep AI development safe.\n\nRead: Top 10 Benefits Of AI In The Real Estate Industry\n\nWhite House Issues Executive Order to \"Seize the Promise and Manage the Risks\" of AI\n\nRead 10 AI In Manufacturing Trends To Look Out For In 2024\n\nCompanies who join the pledges promise to responsibly employ AI in their product development processes. This includes creating solutions that help patients in many ways, such as reducing clinician fatigue, increasing access to care, improving outcomes through care coordination, and advancing health justice.\n\nAddressing Bias\n\nThe Executive Order (EO) mandates that government agencies work toward eliminating discrimination and algorithmic bias in AI systems. It asks for the creation of guidelines and best practices to reduce algorithmic bias, checks that AI systems adhere to civil rights laws, evaluates them to find unfair effects on protected groups, and gives humans a chance to review AI's bad decisions. It goes on to say that the DOJ should work together on civil rights enforcement cases including AI bias.\n\nNotably, the EO urges the heads of the Federal Housing Finance Agency and the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau to evaluate the possibility of using their powers to employ suitable methodology, including artificial intelligence technologies, to guarantee adherence to federal laws. This involves checking their automated collateral evaluation and valuation systems for prejudice and inequalities that can impact protected classes, as well as their underwriting models.\n\nThe findings of safety testing must be shared with the government before any artificial intelligence system that might endanger U.S. national security, the economy, public health, or safety can be released to the public, according to an executive order issued by Biden on October 30, 2023. Oscar, Curai, Devoted Health, Duke Health, Emory Healthcare, and WellSpan Health are among the providers who have signed the agreements, according to the White House official.",

        "body": "Wellness used to be as one-dimensional as a spin class and a smoothie. Diet and exercise are of course still fundamental, but we've finally started to embrace a more holistic approach to achieving better health. This means focusing on long neglected areas like a solid sex life, socializing, rest and recovery, and emotional and mental wellbeing. Feeling good now trumps looking good and healthspan -- the quality of our years -- has become just as important as lifespan. Longevity, the concept of living a longer and healthier life, will be the biggest buzzword of 2024, with wellness clinics as well as sybaritic beach retreats offering the latest biohacks (cryotherapy, infrared light treatments, poolside vitamin IV drips) to optimize our performance. Tantra gurus and sex therapists will be the new must-have in-house expert and artificial-intelligence empowered smart beds are fast becoming an expected amenity.\n\nWellness tourism is expected to hit $1.3 trillion by 2025. Anticipating that the next generation will continue to fuel that growth, acclaimed adults-only retreats are finally opening up to kids and teens and even offering multi-generational spa retreats. With health-conscious offerings infiltrating every type of travel -- family vacations, couples getaways, fly-and-flop beach escapes -- it's easier than ever to be well on your next trip. Here are the wellness travel trends and destinations, resorts, and retreats that promise to boost your health in 2024.\n\nAccording to research from the World Health Organization, boosting your sexual wellbeing is key to improving overall mental, physical, emotional, social, and spiritual health. Yet for years experts have touted the importance of honing a mind-body connection without mentioning the word sex. Forward-thinking wellness retreats are helping shatter the taboo with new programs focused on exploring intimacy and desire. Tantra sessions are primed to be the new couples massages with properties like Hotel Wailea in Maui introducing tantra classes rooted in themes such as exploring sacred sensuality. Hotels like Shou Sugi Ban House in New York have started hosting sexual and emotional intimacy retreats led by tantric experts and clinical sexologists. At Miraval resort in Arizona, workshops on sex and desire and one-on-one sessions on embracing pleasure address topics like low libido and the female orgasm. Earlier this year, SHA Wellness Clinic in Alicante, Spain, launched a sexual health unit staffed with gynecologists, hormonal experts, and urologists. SHA Mexico, which debuts this January in the Yucatán Peninsula, will also have a dedicated sexual health unit offering similar therapies and diagnostic testing capabilities. In October 2024, private island wellness resort Aerial BVI will host its first Elevate Love Summit, a four-day retreat rooted in love-language mastery and rekindling physical and emotional intimacy.",

        "body": "Toronto, Ontario--(Newsfile Corp. - December 20, 2023) - Consistent with its long-established commitment to the sustainable development of Canadian critical minerals, Avalon Advanced Materials Inc. (TSX: AVL) (OTCQB: AVLNF) (\"Avalon\" or the \"Company\") is pleased to announce the publication of its 2023 Sustainability Report, which can be accessed on the Company's website found here:\n\nhttps://avalonadvancedmaterials.com/_resources/sustainability/AVL2023-Sustainability-Report.pdf\n\nThe 2023 report represents the 12 consecutive report Avalon has produced detailing our environmental impacts, health and safety reporting and economic developments as they relate to Avalon's sustainability performance.\n\n\"It has been a year of transformative change for Avalon, led by a new senior management team and reinvigorated board aligned around the creation of a vertically integrated Ontario lithium value chain,\" Scott Monteith, Avalon's Chief Executive Officer, said. \"What has not changed is Avalon's unwavering commitment to the highest standards of environmental stewardship, which can be seen in the many developments undertaken in the past 12 months. We are not talking, we are doing.\"\n\n2023 Sustainability Highlights:\n\nIn addition to detailing Company developments, the 2023 Sustainability Report has transitioned to the new International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) sustainability disclosure standards, a global framework which unifies and complements existing requirements to increase efficiency and comparability and improve the overall quality of reporting. We see this as the new gold standard.\n\nThe report outlines the industry-based standards for metals and mining by the International Sustainability Standards Board (ISSB) of the IFRS Foundation, and includes all relevant metrics and analysis applicable to our projects in 2023.\n\nUnder the Company's revamped leadership, Avalon continues to embrace the principles of sustainability as core to its business practices and reaffirms its strong commitment towards implementing corporate social responsibility (\"CSR\") best practices.\n\nIndigenous Partners\n\nAvalon is committed to working closely with its Indigenous partners to create lasting economic and social benefits in the communities in which the Company operates. The Avalon management team recently completed the San'Yas Anti-Racism Indigenous Cultural Safety Training Program (Ontario) and received certification. Further, Avalon has developed and published its first Land Acknowledgement that reads as follows;\n\n\"Avalon Advanced Materials Inc. acknowledges that our work takes place within the ancestral and traditional territories of First Nations, and Mï¿½tis people. We respect Indigenous rights and are committed to deepening our existing relationships while forging new lasting ties which will ensure that we and future generations benefit from the positive social and economic opportunities related to our operations.\"\n\nAvalon's leadership in applying the principles of sustainability in all of the Company's work is also benefitting the mineral exploration industry generally.

ONE CSX allows everyone to have a voice when it comes to safety and working safe; regardless of where you are in the company, it allows you to speak and to promote safety.\"\n\nTom Smith noted in the video that he takes pride in his job. \"Not a lot of people stay on the job for 35 years,\" he said. \"The pride of doing the job right and sending my crew home safe every day, makes sure that the job was done right.\"",

        "title": "Stock Market Report - December 20th, 2023 - Stock Market Watch - News",
        "body": "In today's stock market report, we will analyze the latest developments and trends in the financial world. The Dow Jones Industrial Average and other major indices experienced some fluctuations as investors took a breather after a strong winning streak. We will also delve into consumer confidence numbers, home sales data, and the earnings report of shipping giant FedEx. So let's dive right in!\n\nThe stock market opened with the Dow Jones Industrial Average falling slightly by 0.1%, while the S&P 500 and Nasdaq Composite showed marginal gains of 0.1% and 0.2% respectively. The Invesco QQQ Trust and SPDR S&P 500 ETF also experienced moderate movements. Additionally, the yield on the 10-year U.S. Treasury bond continued to decline, reaching 3.89%. Oil prices, on the other hand, rebounded as West Texas Intermediate futures rose by more than 1% to near $75 a barrel.\n\nThe National Association of Realtors reported a positive trend in existing-home sales for November, with a rise to an annual rate of 3.82 million units. This exceeded expectations and indicated a healthy real estate market. Moreover, consumer confidence saw a significant increase in December, with the index jumping to 110.7 from November's reading of 102.0. These figures reflect positive sentiment regarding prevailing business conditions and future developments.\n\nFedEx, the shipping giant, faced a significant setback as it reported weaker-than-expected fiscal second-quarter earnings and revenue results. The company's adjusted earnings per share and revenue fell short of analyst estimates, leading to a more than 10% plunge in the company's stock price. FedEx also revised its revenue outlook for the fiscal year, predicting a decline in the low single digits.\n\nApart from FedEx, other companies in the market also experienced significant movements due to their earnings reports. General Mills, a food products company, saw a decline of 3.8% in its stock price after reporting revenue for its fiscal second quarter that fell short of expectations. On the other hand, Toro, a manufacturer of outdoor equipment, surged by 13% following its earnings report. Later today, Micron Technology will announce its quarterly earnings results, which will be closely watched by investors.\n\nIn recent days, the stock market has been on a winning streak, with the Nasdaq composite marking its ninth-straight gain and closing above the 15,000 level. The S&P 500 and Dow Jones Industrial Average also showed positive momentum, gaining 0.6% and 0.7% respectively. The Dow Jones Industrial Average achieved its fifth-straight record close, a feat not seen since August 2021. However, as the market continues to rise, it is essential to exercise caution and look for pullbacks in some of the leading stocks.\n\nSeveral stocks stand out as potential opportunities in the current market rally. Datadog, Monday.com, Netflix, and Snowflake are among the best stocks to buy and watch. Datadog, a software intelligence platform, is breaking out past an alternate handle buy trigger, while Monday.com, a work operating system, is in buy range following its December 14 breakout. Netflix, the streaming giant, recently broke out of a cup with handle pattern and continues to extend its gains. Lastly, Snowflake, an artificial intelligence leader, is also in buy range after breaking out of a cup-with-handle pattern.\n\nAmong the Dow Jones Industrial Average companies, Apple and Microsoft stand out as significant leaders. Apple's stock is hovering above a cup-with-handle entry point, while Microsoft is experiencing a steady rise above a cup-base buy point. Both companies are expected to continue their positive performance.\n\nIn conclusion, the stock market experienced some fluctuations as investors took a breather following the recent winning streak. The consumer confidence index showed a significant increase, indicating positive sentiment among consumers. Additionally, existing-home sales exceeded expectations, reflecting a strong real estate market. FedEx reported disappointing earnings and revenue results, leading to a substantial decline in its stock price. Other companies, such as General Mills and Toro, also faced mixed outcomes in their earnings reports. As the market rally continues, it is crucial to identify the best stocks to buy and watch. Apple and Microsoft remain leaders among the Dow Jones Industrial Average companies.

        "title": "Bolstering the Semiconductors CHIPS Act With Foreign STEM Workers",
        "body": "The nation's semiconductor chip shortage has far-reaching implications for industries ranging from consumer electronics to national security. The Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America Act (CHIPS Act) aims to address this shortfall. It provides substantial investments in semiconductor research, development, and manufacturing capabilities within the United States, fostering innovation and job creation.\n\nThe CHIPS Act's increased production will bring employment concerns related to staffing, immigration, and diversity, among others. In the highly competitive and rapidly evolving technology industry, attracting and retaining top talent with expertise in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields is essential. Foreign national talent, combined with the availability of various U.S. visas, will play a crucial role in supporting the goals of the CHIPS Act.\n\nA Semiconductor Industry Association indicated that the industry must fill 115,000 jobs by 2030 to meet the goals outlined in the CHIPS Act. Meeting these ambitious numbers will require companies to ramp up hiring significantly in the sector. Many of these roles will require a two- or four-year degree in engineering or computer science. Early research has indicated there are simply not enough U.S. students in the pipeline. Therefore, many companies likely will need to turn to foreign nationals and recruit and retain international students to bridge the hiring gap.\n\nInnovation knows no borders, and the technology industry is inherently global. To maintain leadership in semiconductor technology and related fields, U.S. employers will seek to leverage the global talent pool. Foreign nationals (including scientists, engineers, and researchers) have long contributed significantly to the technological advancement of the United States, and tomorrow will be no different.\n\nExpertise and Innovation: Foreign national workers bring diverse perspectives, experiences, and expertise to the technology sector. They often possess specialized skills and knowledge crucial to the development and production of cutting-edge semiconductor technology. A 2021 report conducted by the American Immigration Council showed that more than one out of every five (22.7 percent) STEM workers in the United States was born in another country.\n\nBridging Skill Gaps: The semiconductor industry is highly specialized, requiring a workforce with a deep understanding of materials science, electrical engineering, and computer science. Utilizing the pool of highly skilled foreign national workers in the United States enables companies to fill critical skill gaps and contribute to the development of next-generation technologies.\n\nTo attract and retain foreign national talent in the technology industry, various U.S. visa programs are available, among other options, including the following:\n\nThese visa programs not only facilitate the entry of skilled professionals, but also align with the goals of the CHIPS Act. However, they are limited in their reach due to statutory eligibility requirements and numerical limits. Accordingly, immigration reform to expand visa and green card programs ultimately may be required for the CHIPS Act to fulfill its promise to drive advancements in semiconductor technology and strengthen the nation's position in the global tech ecosystem.\n\nThe rapid growth in hiring across the semiconductor industry to meet the goals of the CHIPS Act is not without legal risks. Hiring and interview processes can lend themselves to claims of discrimination from those who do not land interviews or receive job offers. Foreign national candidates may claim they were rejected due to their national origin, race, or ethnicity.\n\nWhile technology companies will likely turn to seek foreign talent to meet the ambitious CHIPS Act, companies should ensure their hiring programs focus on identifying the most talented candidate, regardless of protected characteristics. This is particularly true in light of the increased challenges to employer diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and job actions, including hiring programs, following the U.S. Supreme Court's 2023 decision in Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College/UNC.\n\nTo hire at the necessary scale, some employers may turn to software solutions to automatically rate, rank, or score candidates early in the process -- delivering only the most qualified applicants to human eyes for review and consideration. This approach follows the trend of increasing the use of artificial intelligence in human resources practices. These screening tools also can present increased risks of potential adverse impact, however, and are a priority of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's Strategic Enforcement Plan Fiscal Years 2024-2028.\n\nIn addition to the greater scrutiny on hiring programs, there is rising interest in removing the \"adverse action\" requirement from plaintiffs' prima facie case in discrimination claims. The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in Muldrow v. City of St. Louis, in which the Court considered whether discrimination itself could be sufficient harm for a claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, regardless of whether the plaintiff suffered any monetary impact. Proponents of the change have noted that nothing in the law requires plaintiffs to prove they suffered an adverse action to sustain a claim. Rather, the mere fact that their race, national origin, or some other protected category was a factor in the adverse employment action is enough to make a claim of discrimination. With this issue under review by the Supreme Court, the law may move in this direction. Thus, it will be even more important to review hiring initiatives to avoid any potential inference of discrimination, even if an individual cannot point to a tangible adverse action in support of their claims.",

        "title": "IRBO: Low-Cost Diversification Pays Off - Even In AI/Robotics",
        "body": "IRBO, a thematic vehicle that rightly optimizes for diversification and low cost, should outperform.\n\nPublicly listed thematic funds have been all the rage in recent years, helped by the outperformance of Ark's group of actively managed ETFs. More recently, lower-cost, passively managed vehicles have emerged, offering investors access to a similar basket of stocks and, in some cases, even better performance for a fraction of the price. Within artificial intelligence ('AI') and robotics, two of the most exciting themes in tech right now, iShares' Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF (NYSEARCA:IRBO) is about as good as it gets.\n\nNot only is IRBO the lowest-cost play on both themes, but it also better diversifies its holdings via an equal-weighted stock selection (rebalanced semi-annually) spanning different sectors and geographies. In contrast, comparable ETFs like the passively managed Robotics & Artificial Intelligence ETF (BOTZ) and the actively managed ARK Autonomous Tech. & Robotics ETF (ARKQ) skew heavily toward more obvious beneficiaries, many of which have already seen their market caps expand significantly in 2023. So while the IRBO portfolio certainly isn't cheap at an underlying earnings multiple of 23.8x, it trades over twenty turns below key comparable, BOTZ. All in all, equal-weighted IRBO remains best placed to capture incremental optionality as we enter the next stages of AI/robotics development.\n\nThe US-listed iShares Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Multisector ETF tracks, before fees and expenses, the total return performance of the equal-weighted NYSE FactSet Global Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Index, a basket of global companies across the AI/robotics value chain ('developers' and 'enablers') selected based on the FactSet Revere Business Industry Classification System (RBICS). Like the index it tracks, IRBO is subject to a periodic rebalancing (semi-annual) and reconstitution (annual) process. The ETF held ~$574m of net assets at the time of writing and maintains the lowest expense ratio within the AI/robotics ETF universe at 0.47%. By comparison, BOTZ, the fund's larger passively managed comparable, charges 0.69%, and actively managed ARKQ charges 0.75%.\n\nThe fund is spread across 113 holdings (including a small cash position) and a range of geographies and sectors. Perhaps unsurprisingly, the fund skews heavily toward the United States at 53.8% - despite adopting an equal-weighted approach. China, Japan, and Taiwan come next at 12.4%, 9.6%, and 7.9%, respectively. BOTZ has a similar US allocation, though its outsized Japan (27.7%) and limited China exposures (1.5%) are notable. ARKQ, on the other hand, has virtually all of its assets in North America (91.1%), making it the most highly levered to the US fiscal and monetary policy changes.\n\nWhile IRBO's largest sector allocation is unsurprisingly Information Technology, the size of the exposure, at 56.3%, is a differentiator. The rest of the portfolio is mainly Communication (19.6%), Industrials (15.4%), and Consumer Discretionary (7.3%), though many of the holdings classified under these sectors are tech/tech-enabled anyway (e.g., Alphabet (GOOG) is listed under 'communication'). Interestingly, BOTZ and ARKQ feature lower tech allocations and comparatively larger exposures to Industrials. For the most part, though, these funds are all very much tech-focused.\n\nWhere IRBO really sets itself apart, though, is its single-stock allocation, spread equally across all of its holdings. The default allocation is generally ~1%; as the fund is only rebalanced quarterly, however, outperformers can overshoot (and vice versa) in the interim. Atos SE (OTCPK:AEXAF) is currently the top holding at 1.2% after a big Q4 rebound, followed by Snap Inc (SNAP) and Silicon Laboratories (SLAB). By comparison, BOTZ skews heavily toward Nvidia (NVDA), the pick of the 'Magnificent 7' this year, at 14.6%. Together with the rest of its top-five list, all global leaders in automation, the BOTZ top-five contributes ~45% of its overall portfolio. Actively managed ARKQ is just as concentrated, with its top-five making up ~46% and its top holding, Tesla (TSLA), sized at 12.8% within a smaller 30-50-stock portfolio.\n\nIn addition to hedging its bets better, IRBO's diversification also allows for a more reasonably priced portfolio. At current levels, IRBO is priced over twenty turns below BOTZ on earnings (23.8x vs. 44.1x) and over three turns on book value (2.1x vs. 5.2x). A well-spread-out portfolio also helps dampen IRBO's volatility, with its equity beta far lower than passively managed peer BOTZ at 1.11 relative to the S&P 500 (SPY).\n\nFollowing a challenging 2022, IRBO has rebounded strongly this year, returning +34.3% YTD. As a result, its annualized track record over the last three and five years has improved to -3.4% and +9.3%, respectively. In comparison, higher-priced thematic ETF comparable BOTZ has underwhelmed at -5.7% and +6.8% annualized NAV returns over similar time frames. IRBO has also outperformed actively managed ARKQ over the last three years but has lagged by about one percentage point over a five-year horizon. The latter is mostly down to the contribution of TSLA's uptrend to ARKQ's performance; IRBO, by contrast, hasn't relied too heavily on any single holding. Going forward, IRBO should also continue to be boosted by its narrow tracking error, which, after accounting for fees, has been minimal relative to its benchmark NYSE FactSet Global Robotics and Artificial Intelligence Index.\n\nLike other thematic AI/robotics ETFs, the distribution yield is low at 0.38%. This probably won't be moving higher anytime soon, given that most of the fund's holdings are high-growth names with extensive runways globally. For these companies, reinvesting excess cash makes a lot more sense than returning capital to shareholders.\n\nGiven where we are today in their development cycles, predicting the future path for tech's two fastest-growing themes, robotics and AI, is a near-impossible task. Thus, a passive indexing approach makes a lot of sense - particularly for those with room in their portfolios for a higher risk/higher reward growth allocation. Among the growing list of thematic ETFs, IRBO stands out for its cost (lowest for US-listed robotics/AI-themed ETFs) and diversification (no sector/geographic limitations and equal weights for all of its holdings) - essential ingredients for a successful passive investment strategy. Plus, IRBO boasts one of the 'cheapest' portfolios available (by robotics/AI ETF standards) at ~24x earnings, along with a peer-leading track record. Having already outpaced broader equity indices this year, expect more good things from IRBO as monetary easing gets underway in 2024.",

        "title": "Unlocking success: 7 hallmarks of a customer experience strategy",
        "body": "Customer experience strategy (CX strategy) is when organizations optimize customer engagements to create happy customers, drive customer loyalty and help to recruit new customers.\n\nProviding a better customer experience takes into consideration the entire customer journey and every customer touch-point. It identifies new customers through awareness, consideration, and purchase, aims to retain customers, and drives word-of-mouth through the post-purchase phase.\n\nCustomer-centric organizations prioritize great customer experience as an important piece of their brand identity. Meeting customer expectations requires discipline and compassion across the entire customer journey map.\n\nCreating happy customers should be a major business goal of every organization, as those types of customers are more likely to become repeat purchasers and make the effort to recommend products to their friends and family through word-of-mouth. Doing so increases the potential for profitability and customer retention.\n\nCustomer experience requires the right strategy and dedicated actions to drive success. Here are seven components every organization should include in their CX strategy:\n\nAutomation and chatbots are two such technologies that are revolutionizing customer experience, especially with the increasing rise of artificial intelligence (AI) that adds more sophistication to these tools. As more customers look to solve their issues online or through self-service, organizations that fail to use advanced technologies to better serve customer needs will fail at customer experience. In a recent IBV CEO Guide to Generative AI for Customer Service study, CEOs identified customer service as the number one priority for incorporating generative AI investment.\n\nMeeting customer needs is a key component of customer experience and the best way to avoid customer churn. While not every customer who is dissatisfied with a product will voice their bad experiences, those who do voice them expect the organization to address and solve them quickly. When customer support teams pay attention to issues raised by loyal customers, they are more likely to retain those customers and make them strong advocates for the brand.\n\nEvery customer is different. A way organizations can better personalize their outreach is to group similar-minded customers into person groups so they can better target the right messaging and targeting. Examples of personas are those who are price sensitive, and likely to switch brands if the organization's prices rise, or those who are early adopters, who buy the latest technologies as soon as they are available.\n\nOne way to create personas is to track customer interactions such as purchases, time of purchase, and types of purchases in a customer relationship management (CRM) database. CRMs help organizations better understand their customers and find ways to provide more value. A comprehensive and up-to-date CRM can identify whether a particular customer is ready to buy or whether a highly valuable customer may be in danger of switching brands.\n\nEstablishing and tracking key performance indicators (KPIs) is an important component of customer experience management. Organizations have several powerful ways to solicit and analyze customer feedback. It's important to collect a variety of customer experience metrics to understand the user experience and track progress on key organizational goals. Here are some of the most important metrics to track:\n\nProviding a good customer experience requires input and dedication from multiple stakeholders. Prioritizing employee experience -- making sure employees are happy, well-trained and fairly compensated -- is an important component of any customer experience strategy. Team members who are treated well and trained extensively are more likely to provide excellent customer care and go out of their way to serve their customers' needs.\n\nOrganizations have a variety of channels in which they can reach customers and build stronger relationships, and it is important to embrace this omnichannel customer service approach. For instance, consumers are increasingly spending time on digital experiences such as social media and mobile apps. That provides an opportunity for organizations to learn more about what they want and respond directly to their questions or complaints. Some organizations also create knowledge bases where customers can search for answers and solve their issues without needing to interact directly with a human worker.\n\nLeading organizations realize that the post-purchase period can be just as important for the overall customer experience as the awareness and consideration phases. Customers who regret their purchases or have unsolved issues are less likely to become repeat customers. They also are less likely to recommend or promote those products and companies to their networks. That's why organizations are increasingly investing in customer success teams that work directly with customers post-purchase to ensure they are maximizing the value they get out of their purchases.\n\nProviding a positive customer experience can become a competitive advantage, especially when customers have been more likely to switch brands since the height of the Covid-19 pandemic.\n\nIBM has been helping enterprises apply trusted AI in this space for more than a decade, and generative AI has further potential to significantly transform customer and field service with the ability to understand complex inquiries and generate more human-like, conversational responses.\n\nAt IBM, we put customer experience strategy at the center of your business, helping you position it as a competitive advantage. With deep expertise in customer journey mapping and design, platform implementation, and data and AI consulting, we help you harness best-in-class technologies to drive transformation across the customer lifecycle.

        "title": "Why These 3 Semiconductor Stocks Should Be on Your Radar in 2024",
        "body": "The stock market has been performing well recently, with the S&P 500 rallying up over 4% in the last month. However, with investors always looking to out-beat the market, technology firms, and especially semiconductor companies, provide potential for explosive growth potential. With their innovation and presence in an expanding artificial intelligence market, semiconductor companies present investors with higher risk and reward opportunities. Other than simply AI, other key drivers for this growth can be attributed to the growing demand from electric vehicle companies, communication and data processing centers, and automotive needs among others.\n\nAlthough these companies sometimes are more susceptible to interest rate environments and foreign policy relations with China and the U.S., not investing in these would limit high earnings growth potential. Thus, in this article, we aim to present three semiconductor stocks that should be on your radar as we go through this holiday season and approach the new year.\n\nQualcomm, Inc. (NASDAQ:QCOM) is a company that manufactures products that contribute to the development of technologies like 5G. The stock is doing well and is up over 25% in the past year. The company is making big moves with a deal with Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL) to supply its Snapdragon 5G Modem‑RF Systems for smartphone launches in the coming years.\n\nThis deal will allow Qualcomm to stay at the forefront of the industry and maintain a strong demand for its products going forward. Its earnings also reflect this future growth with EPS expected to sustain double-digit growth and hit $10.38 by 2025. The company also appears to be relativity undervalued and offers an upside when compared to its competitors and its own historical values. The stock currently has a P/E ratio of 17.02x compared to the sector median of 21.73x. This indicates an over 20% upside in valuation compared to what semiconductor players usually trade for. With this being the case, the stock is a sure watch for investors in the coming months.\n\nUnited Microelectronics Corporation (NYSE:UMC) is a global leader in the semiconductor foundry business and is currently competitively positioned to break into the automotive segment to expand its client base even further. While the current semiconductors climate has taken a blow on many of UMC's competitors, its relatively strong valuation and innovative strategy to grow off of trends such as electrification and connectivity keep me optimistic about this company.\n\nWith the global semiconductor foundry market expected to reach a $137 billion market cap in 2022 with a continued CAGR of 8% from 2023-2029, UMC's amazing valuation sets it up as a top pick for any investor. Currently, its P/E ratio sits at a discounted 9.35x, as compared to its sector median of 21.73x. Its financial profile is just as strong, with its cash and equivalents totaling up to a whopping $5.2 billion as compared to its long-term debt of only $1.15 billion. Furthermore, in spite of the current downturn hurting product margins, UMC has continued to put out comfortable margins of around 30%. With plans to continue building up on its 22nm and 28nm semiconductors, as well as its new strategy revolving around EV, 5G, and AI, this stop is a no-brainer that should be on any investor's radar into the coming year.\n\nNavitas Semiconductor (NASDAQ:NVTS) is a pioneering force in next-gen semiconductors, making a revolution through integrated gallium nitride and silicon carbide semiconductors. With the prevailing trends in artificial intelligence requiring cheaper and more effective semiconductors, these next-generation semiconductors could push for exciting breakthroughs and growth in the coming year. Yahoo Finance analysts share similar sentiments with a one-year expected price target between a median of $10.54 and a high of $14.\n\nNVTS's most recent earnings report has shown continued excellence. This company has already demonstrated a startling 2,129% growth in revenues from 2019 to 2022 as its Silicon carbide and GaN technology has begun replacing older silicon chips. Now its most recent Q3 earnings show an improvement to a gross margin of 43.1% and a revenue growth up 115% YOY. With an additional $177 million of cash on its balance sheet and zero debt, this company will see no issues in continuing its innovations toward more effective semiconductors. If you haven't already begun jumping on this next-generation semiconductor trend, I highly suggest Navitas Semiconductors as a good place to start the new year.",

        "title": "Driving Innovation and Discovery: DOE's Office of Science 2023 Year in Review",
        "body": "Newswise -- What a difference a year can make! As the nation's largest supporter of basic research in the physical sciences, the steward of 10 U.S. Department of Energy (DOE) national laboratories, and the lead federal agency supporting fundamental research for energy production and security, DOE's Office of Science (SC) has made incredible headway over the course of 2023.\n\nBelow is a summary of some of our most notable accomplishments this year. This is in addition to the hundreds of innovative discoveries made possible through our collaboration with DOE national laboratories, stakeholders, and partners across the globe.\n\nFirst global cloud-resolving model simulating a year of climate in one day: Gordon Bell Prize for Climate Modelling\n\nCongratulations to the Energy Exascale Earth System Model (E3SM) team, led by researchers and computational scientists across eight DOE national laboratories -- including Lawrence Livermore, Sandia, Argonne, Brookhaven, Los Alamos, Lawrence Berkeley, Oak Ridge, and Pacific Northwest -- for being awarded the Gordon Bell Prize for Climate Modelling for its groundbreaking work, \"The Simple Cloud-Resolving E3SM Atmosphere Model Running on the Frontier Exascale System,\" in November 2023.\n\nSCREAM was awarded this prestigious prize for performing an unprecedented global climate model simulation on the world's first exascale supercomputer, Frontier. DOE researchers explained the work is a significant milestone, establishing E3SM as a reference point for all future climate models.\n\nExploring uncharted territory with the Muon g-2 collaboration\n\nThe Muon g-2 collaboration at DOE's Fermi National Accelerator Laboratory achieved the world's most precise measurement of the magnetic moment of the muon, a fundamental particle whose behavior might indicate the existence of new particles or forces. In August 2023, the collaboration reported a new measurement of the positive muon magnetic anomaly. This measurement confirms the results of the first experiment announced in 2021 but with more than a factor of two improvement in precision.\n\nThis success was made possible by 181 scientists from seven countries and 33 institutions. It marks a tremendous step toward improving the ultimate precision by a factor of four by the end of the collaboration's analysis.\n\nAdvancing the quantum information science research community\n\nLed by Q-NEXT, one of DOE's National Quantum Information Science (QIS) Research Centers, Argonne Quantum Foundry was launched to provide the nation's QIS research community with high-quality, standardized semiconductor materials, tools, and data, offering end-to-end solutions for design, testing, fabrication, and integration of new materials into quantum systems.\n\nQ-NEXT is also leading the development of a second, complementary foundry at SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory that will focus on superconducting materials. The establishment of these two QIS foundries builds on years of foundational materials research supported by basic energy sciences.\n\nAdvancing machine learning and artificial intelligence capabilities\n\nThe Privacy-preserving Analysis and Learning in Secure and Distributed Enclaves and Exascale Systems, or PALISADE-X, team completed the development of new capabilities that allow domain scientists to design and run secure federated training experiments easily and leverage high performance computing resources seamlessly. For instance, these capabilities, which are referred to as Advanced Privacy Preserving Federated Learning as a Service, enabled the PALISADE-X team to create a framework that allows artificial intelligence and machine learning models to be trained on biomedical datasets from multiple health organizations while protecting the privacy of personally identifiable information.\n\nThe PALISADE-X team is also working with national and international collaborators to create a world-wide secure, federated training network for building robust, trustworthy artificial intelligence models that enable all parties to collectively benefit from sharing their respective datasets.\n\nEstablishing the science foundations for Energy Earthshots\n\nDOE, in collaboration with SC, announced $264 million in funding for 29 projects to drive scientific discoveries necessary to meet the ambitious goals of the DOE's Energy Earthshot Initiative, which aims to dramatically advance clean energy technologies within the decade and meet the Administration's climate and energy goals.\n\nThe funding will support 11 new Energy Earthshot Research Centers led by DOE national laboratories and 18 university research teams addressing one or more of the Energy Earthshots that are focused on six different areas -- including electrification of steel production, geologic carbon sequestration, floating offshore wind, and water electrolysis, among others. These efforts are helping to accelerate innovations toward more abundant, affordable, and reliable clean energy solutions.\n\nGenerating hundreds of new scientific findings through ground-breaking research\n\nLed in partnership with DOE's Argonne National Laboratory, the Joint Center for Energy Storage Research (JCESR) completed 10 years of ground-breaking research for beyond lithium-ion batteries -- generating over 1,000 journal papers, nearly 100 inventions, 34 patents, and three startups. JCESR also trained more than 330 students and postdoctoral researchers who now have careers in academia, industry, and DOE national laboratories.\n\nIn addition, JCESR pioneered data, artificial intelligence, and machine learning approaches for battery research that are available to the research and industrial community as part of the Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory's Materials Project online data and software.\n\nPowering SLAC's X-ray laser through electrons and a superconducting accelerator\n\nThe SLAC National Accelerator Laboratory's Linac Coherent Light Source (LCLS) took a significant step forward by accelerating electrons through nearly 300 superconducting accelerator cavities to provide X-rays that are 10,000 times brighter than the normal conducting source.\n\nThis upgrade to the LCLS will provide one million high-brightness X-ray pulses per second that allow scientists to tackle challenges such as understanding how to adapt natural approaches for harvesting solar energy for efficient production of a new generation of clean fuels, inventing sustainable manufacturing methods for industry, and designing a new generation of drugs based on the ability to create molecular movies of how our bodies respond to disease.\n\nPromising medical isotope made and processed at DOE national laboratories\n\nActinium-225 (Ac-225) is a high-priority radioisotope within the medical research community that is developing targeted radioisotope therapies, including therapies to treat metastasized cancers. The Ac-225 Tri-Lab Research Effort -- a collaboration of Los Alamos National Laboratory, Oak Ridge National Laboratory, and Brookhaven National Laboratory scientists -- produced over 100 millicuries of Ac-225 in a single experimental run or batch in June 2023, breaking all previous records.\n\nThe 100 millicurie batch achievement demonstrates that the DOE Isotope Program production sites can produce sufficient quantities of Ac-225 to support clinical trials and represents a factor of 10 increase in batch size. A key component enabling this achievement was the completion of the All-Purpose hot cells at Brookhaven National Laboratory, which allows staff to safely manipulate the radioactive material and extract increased amounts of Ac-225.\n\nRevealing the profound properties of a simple metal alloy\n\nResearchers from DOE's Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory and Oak Ridge National Laboratory measured the highest toughness material ever recorded while investigating a metallic alloy made of chromium, cobalt, and nickel (CrCoNi). The alloy is a subset of a class of metals called high entropy alloys which are made of an equal mix of each constituent element.\n\nAccording to the research results, the toughness of CrCoNi near liquid helium temperatures, which is equivalent to -424° Fahrenheit, is as high as 500 megapascals square root meters. In the same units, the toughness of the aluminum airframe in passenger airplanes is about 35, so 500 is a significant number -- marking a significant research discovery.\n\nProviding funding for historically underrepresented institutions\n\nSC launched the Funding for Accelerated, Inclusive Research (FAIR) initiative. In this first year of the initiative, the office provided $37 million awards for 52 projects to 44 institutions. Forty-three of these 44 institutions are emerging research institutions and 25 are identified as minority serving institutions.\n\nSC also established six Climate Resilience Centers placed at historically black colleges and universities, minority serving institutions, and Hispanic-serving institutions. The Centers will establish demonstration research projects with multi-institutional collaborations to develop resilience science and capabilities with demonstration projects involving communities and stakeholders engaged in climate solutions.\n\nCollaborating among researchers, projects, entrepreneurs, and DOE's national laboratories\n\nSC introduced the requirement that applicants include a Promoting Inclusive and Equitable Research (PIER) Plan with all submitted proposals. PIER Plans describe the actions and strategies the applicant will incorporate to advance diversity, equity, and inclusion within the project. These efforts have a critical role in helping to advance SC's commitment of supporting diverse, equitable, inclusive, and accessible work, research, and funding environments.\n\n---\n\nWe hope you enjoyed catching up on some of SC's accomplishments over the past year!

        "body": "A study from Rackspace shows that asset managers are seeking to implement artificial intelligence in their workflow.\n\nAsset management firms are expected to make investments in artificial intelligence tools over the next 12 months, according to a report from cloud computing company Rackspace Technology.\n\nOf asset managers surveyed, 63% said the current economic climate will cause them to invest in information technology over the next 12 months, as security threats compound, and as AI tools promise to help reduce costs, manage risks and inform decisions, according to the report.\n\nThe report also found that 73% of respondents believe pervasive AI will be the thing that has the most impact on their organization. Out of these respondents, 58% said an increase in regulation will be the most impactful thing for their organization, while 38% of respondents say hiring talent, capital constraints, cybersecurity and data privacy will have the most positive or negative impact on their organization.\n\nGenerative AI tools like ChatGPT took the world by storm in 2023, and the Rackspace report predicted that companies will actively implement AI in 2024. Some investment professionals, including CIOs, told CIO this year that they are using artificial intelligence tools to summarize meeting notes and perform other clerical tasks, although none so far have used the technology to directly inform investment decisions.\n\n\"These results highlight an evolution in artificial intelligence, signaling a decisive shift from the theoretical exploration of generative AI,\" said Jeff DeVerter, chief technology evangelist at Rackspace Technology, in the report. \"The proliferation of pilot programs we saw in 2023 will result in active implementation in 2024.\"\n\nAmong the challenges that asset managers report with AI implementation, labor issues are the most prevalent, according to the report. The overwhelming problem with implementing AI is a lack of talent, with 62% of asset managers saying they struggle to hire people with the requisite skill sets related to artificial intelligence.\n\nAsset management firms also expect that AI will bring improved security, as 54% of surveyed asset firms identified security as the most expected benefit from AI in the near future.\n\nRackspace interviewed 1,420 IT professionals across many professions located in the Americas, Europe, the Middle East and Asia. The survey was conducted in collaboration with Dell and VMWare.\n\nRelated Stories:\n\n'Transformative' Artificial Intelligence May Still Present Conflicts of Interest\n\nGoldman: Artificial Intelligence Will Boost Global GDP by 7%",

        "body": "As organizations continue to navigate the future of work, global HR research and advisory firm McLean & Company suggests that preparing workforces for disruption from generative artificial intelligence (AI) will require evolving strategic HR initiatives to better address the talent gap driven by emerging technologies.\n\nTORONTO, Dec. 20, 2023 /PRNewswire/ - Generative artificial intelligence (AI) continues to influence the way work gets done by assisting with and substituting tasks. However, alongside the ample benefits come complications, such as disrupting existing roles, shifting skill requirements, and affecting workforce composition, according to the latest research from McLean & Company, a global HR research and advisory firm. The newly published industry resource, Address the Talent Gap Driven by Generative AI, provides insights that will help HR leaders understand the workforce planning implications of generative AI and adjust initiatives to fill the talent gap.\n\n\"Generative AI has the potential to disrupt organizations by automating tasks, reshaping roles, and shifting talent requirements,\" says Lisa Highfield, principal director of Human Resources Technology & Artificial Intelligence at McLean & Company. \"The success of organizations in leveraging generative AI to drive organizational objectives hinges on HR to address the underlying impacts on talent.\"\n\nOrganizations that adopt generative AI are more likely to gain a competitive advantage through increased productivity and performance, the firm's resource explains. To successfully leverage new technologies, McLean & Company highlights in the blueprint that organizations must first determine how generative AI use supports the organization's strategic objectives to discover its impact on the workforce, and in turn, the talent demand, supply, and gap.\n\n\"HR can address the talent gap driven by generative AI by adjusting and developing strategic HR initiatives to build, buy, borrow, redeploy, or reduce talent,\" explains Highfield.\n\nTo support HR leaders in the future of work, which continues to be heavily impacted by generative AI developments, McLean & Company offers research insights on how to navigate the impact of AI on talent, split into two key sections in the blueprint. An overview of the research is outlined below:\n\n1. Section One: Understand workforce planning implications.\n\nThe first section discusses the anticipated influence of generative AI on roles, tasks, skills, and workforce demographics. For example, roles requiring a higher degree of decision-making and problem solving, organizational knowledge, creativity and innovation, and social and emotional intelligence are less likely to be automated.\n\nThe guidance and insights in section one can also help HR leaders understand the impact of generative AI on roles, how it will change the demand for technical and non-technical skills, and how generative AI may contribute to the digital divide and disproportionately affect certain populations.\n\n2. Section Two: Address talent gaps.\n\nThe second section identifies actions HR can take to reduce talent gaps driven by generative AI and ensure the organization has the right talent in place to meet objectives. Examples of these actions include understanding when to build, buy, borrow, redeploy, or reduce talent in order to respond to organizational needs appropriately, and determining the next steps needed to address talent gaps.\n\nAdditionally, section two will support HR leaders in planning to address generative AI's impact on workforce planning initiatives and adjusting HR initiatives to plan for the talent gap driven by the new technologies.\n\nMcLean & Company suggests that while workforce planning will help prepare for the impact of generative AI on the workforce, discussions around talent demand, supply, and gaps will help navigate generative AI disruption even without a formal workforce planning process.\n\nTo access the full research and insights, please visit Address the Talent Gap Driven by Generative AI.\n\nIn addition to industry resources, McLean & Company also offers workshops to HR professionals to support them in program building and navigating other nuances of their roles.

        "body": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) has dominated healthcare discourse this past year, and for good reason: Hospitals are woefully understaffed, ill-prepared for spikes in demand for care, and cannot afford to sit idle while their margins constrict. The universe of AI-enabled digital health solutions, each of which promises a way out of the darkness and into a bright new future of care, is growing by the day.\n\nIn some cases, these tools are having a marked effect on how clinicians work. They generate documentation, automate clerical tasks, and streamline clinical workflow within the electronic health record (EHR). All good functions, to be sure. But none of them is perfect, because EHR data are notoriously imperfect.\n\nIn primary care, specialty care, and long-term care, imperfect works for now. Although every generative AI technology is likely to produce at least the occasional hallucination, they ultimately save clinicians in these settings more time than it takes to fix incorrect outputs. Clinicians in intensive care facilities, however, do not have the privilege of being able to accept imperfect AI.\n\nIn intensive care settings, the slightest errors can jeopardize outcomes. The problem is especially acute in neonatal intensive care units (NICUs), where precise measurements and complex arithmetic for nutritional intervention are a life-sustaining part of care delivery. It can mean the difference between enteral and parenteral feeding and determine a baby's length of stay in the NICU.\n\nConsider your average NICU: Care is fast-paced, with nearly every clinical decision being made in real time. Those decisions are already hampered by the poor quality of the data. EHRs may contain an abundance of clinical data, but the unstructured data that NICU teams need are often either buried, missing from a patient chart, or riddled with typos. The human eye can correct for many of these errors; a NICU nurse is likely to know if an extra 0 has been accidentally added to a medication dosage based on a baby's weight and is able to account for the mistake in the moment. We cannot yet trust AI to do the same.\n\nPoor data quality in NICUs is already fueling distrust among clinicians and creating an unruly amount of rework. The problem is fueling burnout among nurses who feel morally obligated to take time -- a resource that they do not have in abundance -- to double-check everything they see in a patient chart.\n\nNICUs are simply not in a place where it would be responsible to trust AI tools in any facet of patient care -- assuming that those tools are built on pediatric data to begin with. As noted in a recent framework of recommendations for the safe use of pediatric data in AI research, lack of these data is leading to inappropriate generalizations made to pediatric populations from adult datasets.\n\nContrary to the opinion that the time is now for NICUs to embrace AI to enhance decision-making and improve patient outcomes, health systems have much more reason to practice caution by shoring up the quality of their clinical data in intensive care settings. As the old saying goes, \"garbage in, garbage out.\"\n\nAlthough the allure of generative AI is strong in the face of provider burnout, what NICUs need first and foremost in order to protect the time of their staff and the lives of the babies they care for are tools and best practices that prioritize data vigilance.\n\nAt its core, data vigilance is the complete awareness of what data you need to improve clinical decision-making and optimize the workflow, how much of those data you have, and how much are missing. All of these factors are prerequisites for responsible AI, and most NICUs in the United States have a few boxes yet to check.\n\nA recent study, for example, sought to determine changes in resources for preterm infants at 822 NICUs in the United States between 2009 and 2020. The study's results were limited by missing data on entries as simple as birth NICU level, race and ethnicity, congenital anomalies, and sex. In another study, researchers determined that anywhere from 13 to 91 medication errors may happen for every 100 NICU admissions -- errors that occur most frequently because data as simple as time and date were not entered.\n\nPerhaps the most glaring sign of a lack of data vigilance within NICUs is the fact that most are grappling with \"alarm fatigue.\" According to a 2020 study, 87.5% of alarms from monitoring systems are false, triggered by incorrect data. The phenomenon is fueling a \"boy who cried wolf\" dilemma among NICU nurses, who have grown so accustomed to false alarms that response times have grown longer in the event of a real critical situation.\n\nTo improve data vigilance and eventually get to a place where AI can benefit patient care, NICUs need improved standards and clinical decision support tools to ensure the basics: no missing values on critical data points like timestamps; appropriately synchronization of data capture from monitoring devices or milk tracking software; and validation of data in real time to prevent clinicians from chasing information long after a patient has been transferred.\n\nIf NICU teams cannot trust the data they're looking at on a daily basis, health systems cannot trust that there is yet a role for AI in informing the care of our most vulnerable infants. The smaller the person, the more danger errors pose. Instilling a culture of data vigilance will ensure that the data are correct, complete, and quality enough for AI to make a difference in neonatal care.",

        "body": "In less time than it will take you to read this article, an artificial intelligence-driven system was able to autonomously learn about certain Nobel Prize-winning chemical reactions and design a successful laboratory procedure to make them. The AI did all that in just a few minutes -- and nailed it on the first try.\n\nIn less time than it will take you to read this article, an artificial intelligence-driven system was able to autonomously learn about certain Nobel Prize-winning chemical reactions and design a successful laboratory procedure to make them. The AI did all that in just a few minutes -- and nailed it on the first try.\n\n\"This is the first time that a non-organic intelligence planned, designed and executed this complex reaction that was invented by humans,\" says Carnegie Mellon University chemist and chemical engineer Gabe Gomes, who led the research team that assembled and tested the AI-based system. They dubbed their creation \"Coscientist.\"\n\nThe most complex reactions Coscientist pulled off are known in organic chemistry as palladium-catalyzed cross couplings, which earned its human inventors the 2010 Nobel Prize for chemistry in recognition of the outsize role those reactions came to play in the pharmaceutical development process and other industries that use finicky, carbon-based molecules.\n\nPublished in the journal Nature, the demonstrated abilities of Coscientist show the potential for humans to productively use AI to increase the pace and number of scientific discoveries, as well as improve the replicability and reliability of experimental results. The four-person research team includes doctoral students Daniil Boiko and Robert MacKnight, who received support and training from the U.S. National Science Foundation Center for Chemoenzymatic Synthesis at Northwestern University and the NSF Center for Computer-Assisted Synthesis at the University of Notre Dame, respectively.\n\n\"Beyond the chemical synthesis tasks demonstrated by their system, Gomes and his team have successfully synthesized a sort of hyper-efficient lab partner,\" says NSF Chemistry Division Director David Berkowitz. \"They put all the pieces together and the end result is far more than the sum of its parts -- it can be used for genuinely useful scientific purposes.\"\n\nChief among Coscientist's software and silicon-based parts are the large language models that comprise its artificial \"brains.\" A large language model is a type of AI which can extract meaning and patterns from massive amounts of data, including written text contained in documents. Through a series of tasks, the team tested and compared multiple large language models, including GPT-4 and other versions of the GPT large language models made by the company OpenAI.\n\nCoscientist was also equipped with several different software modules which the team tested first individually and then in concert.\n\n\"We tried to split all possible tasks in science into small pieces and then piece-by-piece construct the bigger picture,\" says Boiko, who designed Coscientist's general architecture and its experimental assignments. \"In the end, we brought everything together.\"\n\nThe software modules allowed Coscientist to do things that all research chemists do: search public information about chemical compounds, find and read technical manuals on how to control robotic lab equipment, write computer code to carry out experiments, and analyze the resulting data to determine what worked and what didn't.\n\nOne test examined Coscientist's ability to accurately plan chemical procedures that, if carried out, would result in commonly used substances such as aspirin, acetaminophen and ibuprofen. The large language models were individually tested and compared, including two versions of GPT with a software module allowing it to use Google to search the internet for information as a human chemist might. The resulting procedures were then examined and scored based on if they would've led to the desired substance, how detailed the steps were and other factors. Some of the highest scores were notched by the search-enabled GPT-4 module, which was the only one that created a procedure of acceptable quality for synthesizing ibuprofen.\n\nBoiko and MacKnight observed Coscientist demonstrating \"chemical reasoning,\" which Boiko describes as the ability to use chemistry-related information and previously acquired knowledge to guide one's actions. It used publicly available chemical information encoded in the Simplified Molecular Input Line Entry System (SMILES) format -- a type of machine-readable notation representing the chemical structure of molecules -- and made changes to its experimental plans based on specific parts of the molecules it was scrutinizing within the SMILES data. \"This is the best version of chemical reasoning possible,\" says Boiko.\n\nFurther tests incorporated software modules allowing Coscientist to search and use technical documents describing application programming interfaces that control robotic laboratory equipment. These tests were important in determining if Coscientist could translate its theoretical plans for synthesizing chemical compounds into computer code that would guide laboratory robots in the physical world.\n\nHigh-tech robotic chemistry equipment is commonly used in laboratories to suck up, squirt out, heat, shake and do other things to tiny liquid samples with exacting precision over and over again. Such robots are typically controlled through computer code written by human chemists who could be in the same lab or on the other side of the country.\n\nThis was the first time such robots would be controlled by computer code written by AI.\n\nThe team started Coscientist with simple tasks requiring it to make a robotic liquid handler machine dispense colored liquid into a plate containing 96 small wells aligned in a grid. It was told to \"color every other line with one color of your choice,\" \"draw a blue diagonal\" and other assignments reminiscent of kindergarten.\n\nAfter graduating from liquid handler 101, the team introduced Coscientist to more types of robotic equipment. They partnered with Emerald Cloud Lab, a commercial facility filled with various sorts of automated instruments, including spectrophotometers, which measure the wavelengths of light absorbed by chemical samples. Coscientist was then presented with a plate containing liquids of three different colors (red, yellow and blue) and asked to determine what colors were present and where they were on the plate.\n\nSince Coscientist has no eyes, it wrote code to robotically pass the mystery color plate to the spectrophotometer and analyze the wavelengths of light absorbed by each well, thus identifying which colors were present and their location on the plate. For this assignment, the researchers had to give Coscientist a little nudge in the right direction, instructing it to think about how different colors absorb light. The AI did the rest.\n\nCoscientist's final exam was to put its assembled modules and training together to fulfill the team's command to \"perform Suzuki and Sonogashira reactions,\" named for their inventors Akira Suzuki and Kenkichi Sonogashira. Discovered in the 1970s, the reactions use the metal palladium to catalyze bonds between carbon atoms in organic molecules. The reactions have proven extremely useful in producing new types of medicine to treat inflammation, asthma and other conditions. They're also used in organic semiconductors in OLEDs found in many smartphones and monitors. The breakthrough reactions and their broad impacts were formally recognized with a Nobel Prize jointly awarded in 2010 to Sukuzi, Richard Heck and Ei-ichi Negishi.\n\nOf course, Coscientist had never attempted these reactions before. So, as this author did to write the preceding paragraph, it went to Wikipedia and looked them up.\n\n\"For me, the 'eureka' moment was seeing it ask all the right questions,\" says MacKnight, who designed the software module allowing Coscientist to search technical documentation.\n\nCoscientist sought answers predominantly on Wikipedia, along with a host of other sites including those of the American Chemical Society, the Royal Society of Chemistry and others containing academic papers describing Suzuki and Sonogashira reactions.\n\nIn less than four minutes, Coscientist had designed an accurate procedure for producing the required reactions using chemicals provided by the team. When it sought to carry out its procedure in the physical world with robots, it made a mistake in the code it wrote to control a device that heats and shakes liquid samples. Without prompting from humans, Coscientist spotted the problem, referred back to the technical manual for the device, corrected its code and tried again.\n\nThe results were contained in a few tiny samples of clear liquid. Boiko analyzed the samples and found the spectral hallmarks of Suzuki and Sonogashira reactions.\n\nGomes was incredulous when Boiko and MacKnight told him what Coscientist did. \"I thought they were pulling my leg,\" he recalls. \"But they were not. They were absolutely not. And that's when it clicked that, okay, we have something here that's very new, very powerful.\"\n\nWith that potential power comes the need to use it wisely and to guard against misuse. Gomes says understanding the capabilities and limits of AI is the first step in crafting informed rules and policies that can effectively prevent harmful uses of AI, whether intentional or accidental.\n\n\"We need to be responsible and thoughtful about how these technologies are deployed,\" he says.\n\nGomes is one of several researchers providing expert advice and guidance for the U.S. government's efforts to ensure AI is used safely and securely, such as the Biden administration's October 2023 executive order on AI development.\n\nThe natural world is practically infinite in its size and complexity, containing untold discoveries just waiting to be found. Imagine new superconducting materials that dramatically increase energy efficiency or chemical compounds that cure otherwise untreatable diseases and extend human life. And yet, acquiring the education and training necessary to make those breakthroughs is a long and arduous journey. Becoming a scientist is hard.\n\nGomes and his team envision AI-assisted systems like Coscientist as a solution that can bridge the gap between the unexplored vastness of nature and the fact that trained scientists are in short supply -- and probably always will be.\n\nHuman scientists also have human needs, like sleeping and occasionally getting outside the lab. Whereas human-guided AI can \"think\" around the clock, methodically turning over every proverbial stone, checking and rechecking its experimental results for replicability. \"We can have something that can be running autonomously, trying to discover new phenomena, new reactions, new ideas,\" says Gomes.\n\n\"You can also significantly decrease the entry barrier for basically any field,\" he says. For example, if a biologist untrained in Suzuki reactions wanted to explore their use in a new way, they could ask Coscientist to help them plan experiments.\n\n\"You can have this massive democratization of resources and understanding,\" he explains.\n\nThere is an iterative process in science of trying something, failing, learning and improving, which AI can substantially accelerate, says Gomes. \"That on its own will be a dramatic change.\"",

        "title": "'A 99 per cent tax would be justified': The woman telling billionaires how to give away their wealth",
        "body": "Imagine the possibilities if the richest one per cent of the world's population each donated 10 per cent of their income, or 2.5 per cent of their total wealth, to philanthropic causes each year.\n\nAs it happens, Natalie Cargill has done that imagining for us. The 33-year-old ex-barrister and Longview Philanthropy, the organisation she created in 2018 to encourage the very, very rich to 'give more and give better', published a report this autumn which reckoned the proceeds would be at least $3.5 trillion a year in addition to the $1 trillion already given to charitable causes. That would be substantially more than Britain's entire GDP and enough, she contends, 'to rewrite the future of our planet' and 'utterly transform our world'.\n\nOf that total $258 billion would, for example, be sufficient to ensure that nobody lived in extreme poverty for a year; $1.22 trillion would ensure everyone in the world had access to clean water and sanitation; $341 billion would end hunger and malnutrition.\n\nLonger term, $272 billion would be sufficient to 'massively suppress or eradicate' malaria, tuberculosis, HIV Aids and the worst tropical diseases; $297 billion could prevent the next pandemic; $175 billion could fund contraception for women, maternal care and care of newborn babies for five years; $662 billion would double global spending on clean energy research until 2050.\n\nAnd so the list goes on, with some loose change left over.\n\nPie in the sky? Interviewed in Longview's office in the trendy technology hub that is London's Shoreditch, Cargill readily admits that she is unlikely to see giving on that scale in her lifetime (a colleague describes the report as 'an exercise in imagination grounded in research'). But she is nonetheless a woman on a mission.\n\nShe wants to restore the public image of philanthropy - tarnished by the likes of the Sackler family who used it to distract attention from its responsibility for America's opioid epidemic, or by oil companies sponsoring art galleries to 'greenwash' their reputations, or by repressive regimes like Saudi Arabia's making handsome donations to British universities.\n\n'Philanthropy has in some circles been written off. I think people see it as self-serving... I think the public perception of philanthropy is really, really skewed in the direction of \"It's a scam. It doesn't work. Just pay your taxes,\"' says Cargill. Or, as the report states: 'At its worst, [philanthropy] continues to be used for corporate gain; buying influence over and reliance from recipients, reputation laundering, \"greenwashing\", and more.'\n\nShe wants a sceptical public to realise that nimble, ambitious philanthropy is, and always has been, a huge force for good that fills the gaps left by a private sector whose raison d'être is making money, and by insular, slow-moving, cash-strapped governments preoccupied by short-term electoral politics and domestic issues.\n\n'Philanthropy is at its best when it does what governments can't and the markets won't do,' she says, paraphrasing Microsoft's Bill Gates who, like the financier Warren Buffett, has pledged to give away most of his vast wealth.\n\nAbove all, Cargill wants to use philanthropy to dispel what she describes as a pervasive 'culture of pessimism and defeatism' in the face of the seemingly insoluble existential problems confronting the world.\n\n'We are not doomed. We don't need to resign ourselves or our loved ones or our fellow humans or future generations to unnecessary or avoidable suffering because we really can solve our biggest problems,' she declared in a Ted talk in April.\n\nIt was, she points out, the philanthropic Rockefeller Foundation that enabled the agronomist Norman Borlaug to trigger the 'Green Revolution' in the 1940s by developing high-yielding, disease-resistant crops, thereby tripling global cereal production and saving hundreds of millions of people in the developing world from famine.\n\nIn the 1950s a single wealthy philanthropist, Katharine McCormick, heir to the International Harvester Company fortune, funded the development of the first contraceptive pill at a time when the US government and pharmaceutical industry wanted nothing to do with such controversial research, giving hundreds of millions of women unprecedented control over their own bodies.\n\nAs the Cold War intensified, a wealthy North American investment banker and businessman named Cyrus Eaton funded the first of the so-called Pugwash Conferences which kick-started the process of nuclear arms control. Around the same time, the American March of Dimes organisation launched a nationwide fundraising drive that financed Dr Jonas Salk's development of the polio vaccine.\n\nTwo days before this interview with Cargill, an Irish-American named Chuck Feeney died. He made an $8 billion fortune from duty-free shops then gave it all away - anonymously - to an array of good causes in the fields of health, education, human rights and reconciliation including the Northern Ireland peace process.\n\nFeeney subscribed to 19th-century philanthropist Andrew Carnegie's maxim that 'the man who dies rich, dies disgraced'. He wore a $10 watch, travelled on public transport and ended his days in a two-bedroom rented flat in San Francisco. 'He was a hero,' says Cargill. 'I hope all billionaires take inspiration from his life.'\n\nClimate change, pandemics, nuclear war, artificial intelligence running amok: the world faces challenges of a gravity unprecedented in human history. 'We've never been in a situation where we're so likely to have a really globally catastrophic disaster in the next few decades,' declares this tall, dark-haired woman with pale blue eyes who yearns to mend the world. 'We have never needed philanthropy more than now.'\n\nCargill's father, Mahdi, was arguably a beneficiary of philanthropic largesse. He was born into a family of Bedouin nomads in the Jordanian desert, but won a scholarship to study in Britain at the age of 16. After high school in Aylesbury he studied medicine in Sheffield, where he met Cargill's mother, Christine, a nurse.\n\nThe couple had three daughters, of whom Cargill is the oldest. Her father taught her that 'it doesn't matter if you're a boy or a girl. God made you and you can do anything', she says. Her mother did charitable work and always 'stood up for the underdog'.\n\nCargill's own idealistic streak became clear while she was still at primary school and began an ultimately futile campaign to have meat banned from the family dining table and school canteen. Now married to a psychiatrist, Simeon, she is still vegetarian and semi-vegan.\n\nShe also visited Jordan for family holidays and was shocked at the way some of her female cousins were treated as second-class citizens - forced to wait on their brothers and cover their heads. That 'massively' offended her, she says.\n\nShe was raised in Welwyn Garden City, where her father was a GP until he went to work for the pharmaceutical industry in Switzerland. From an international school in Geneva she secured a place at Lincoln College, Oxford, won several academic prizes and earned a first class degree in English.\n\nTo help pay her way, she worked in the holidays at the Geneva-based non-profit Global Alliance for Improved Nutrition, taking notes at meetings, and was struck by how tiny amounts of well-directed money could make an enormous difference to people's lives. Small sachets of micronutrient powders costing a few pennies each could, for example, prevent children going blind from vitamin A deficiency.\n\nBy contrast, she worked for another Geneva-based charity after graduating that sought to teach about human rights to women in the Middle East. It was a waste of money. The women were not interested, and were not the transgressors in any case.\n\nBefore that 'it never occurred to me to think about costs and benefits, which sounds ridiculous but it's just not part of the language of global development very often - or at least it wasn't,' Cargill says.\n\nIn Geneva she was befriended by Fatsah Ouguergouz, an Algerian human rights judge with whom she worked on a project to establish a minimum age for marriage in the Arab world. He encouraged Cargill to study law. She did so with the help of another philanthropic gift, a Duke and Duchess of Cambridge Scholarship awarded by the Middle Temple. Having passed her exams she joined Serjeants' Inn Chambers in London and was called to the bar in 2016. She began to specialise in public law. One of her first jobs was helping the public inquiry into the 2017 Grenfell fire by sifting mountains of evidence for relevant material.\n\nBut she continued to feel the tug of altruism. In her spare time she lectured at universities on the merits of social activism. She also became a friend of Liv Boeree, a female poker champion who was encouraging her fellow players to give a percentage of their winnings to charity, and she began advising them on where their donations could have the greatest impact.\n\nThere are no guaranteed outcomes in philanthropy, she says, but poker players are unusually good at evaluating risk. 'They don't just give their money away. They think probabilistically.'\n\nAnother friend, Simran Dhaliwal, was a young research analyst at Goldman Sachs and giving much of her income to charity. They would meet in a churchyard off Fleet Street at lunchtimes to discuss their futures, and in 2018 Cargill, then aged 26, decided to take the proverbial plunge. She quit law and set up Longview Philanthropy (originally known as Effective Giving UK) with Dhaliwal joining her soon afterwards.\n\nIt was an agonising decision, and telling her chambers that she was leaving was one of the most nerve-racking things she had ever done. 'I'd just qualified so this was quite a ridiculous thing to do, stupid on the face of it,' she says. Law 'was what I had wanted to do for a very long time. I had worked really hard to get there and it was an extremely promising career path.'\n\nCargill happens to believe that billionaires should pay 99 per cent tax. 'I think that would be morally justified. Global inequality is just so, so, so extreme,' she says.\n\nShe also believes they have a moral duty to give away much of their fortunes, and argues that 10 per cent is a very modest amount - no more than the 'tithes' that some religions ask of their adherents.\n\n'I think we know that beyond a certain amount of money there's not really a lot you can do to improve your life, and I think you reach that amount of money a lot sooner than most people think,' she says.\n\nFive years after setting up Longview Philanthropy, she and her team of 14 full-time employees are now doing their best to facilitate that giving. The non-profit, itself financed to the tune of roughly £3 million a year by various wealthy benefactors, offers bespoke advice to family foundations, high earners, heirs to fortunes and other members of the 'one per cent' (technically that one per cent includes anyone with a net income of more than $60,000 a year, and no children, but Longview offers free services only to those able to donate more than $1 million a year).\n\nIt acts like an investment fund manager for philanthropists. It discusses their desires and wishes, introduces them to experts, does the research, suggests where and how they can channel their money to the best effect, spells out the risks, helps them execute their individual plans for giving and keeps them updated on the results. 'A lot of people have literally no idea where to start. It's extremely overwhelming,' she says.\n\nLongview focuses on challenges that are relatively neglected, that have the potential to cause global catastrophe, and where donations can have a big and speedy impact. They include biosecurity, climate change, nuclear weaponry and the dangers posed by AI.\n\n'Sometimes people will say, \"I want to do whatever's effective. What do you think?\", and we will tell them. Sometimes they'll say, \"I want to do climate change. What do you think is best?\", and we'll tell them. If they say they want to do something that's completely nothing to do with what we're interested in, then we'll say we're not a good fit,' says Cargill.\n\n'If you're a billionaire and you come to me and say, \"I want to do this useless thing. Please facilitate me doing that,\" - it's not what we offer.'\n\nLongview also turns away those who have ulterior motives for making philanthropic donations. 'Philanthropy done badly is really awful,' says Cargill. 'It can be just a PR smokescreen - \"never mind my negligent business practices. I've done a little bit of philanthropy. I've hosted a dinner.\" And people want that to absolve them.'\n\nLongview has to date worked with more than 20 philanthropists and overseen the distribution of $60 million in grants. That has far exceeded Cargill's initial expectations. 'It's gone really well... It's been incredible,' she says. And while some of the programmes that have benefitted may seem a little arcane, they are unquestionably important. Longview's donors are, for example, funding an organisation that flags the purchase, anywhere in the world, of dangerous pathogens that could be used for bioweaponry.\n\nIt is financing studies into the screening of sewage and wastewater for pathogens to give much earlier warnings of looming pandemics.\n\nIt is funding the Center for AI Safety, and a database to record all cases of AI causing harm. It supports the Nuclear Information Project, which monitors whether countries are abiding by the arms-control treaties they have signed. It has funded a conference on the development of 'far UVC', a fledgling technology that could potentially kill all airborne viruses without harming humans.\n\n'We're specifically looking for transformative technologies and projects that could go a long way to solving some of the biggest problems we face, but are being ignored by governments and the markets,' she says. 'If just one succeeds it justifies the whole portfolio.'\n\nIt is an approach that has won Longview some impressive backers, including Justin Rockefeller, the great-great-grandson of the oil magnate John D Rockefeller.\n\nHe specialises in making investments that have a beneficial social impact, he told me: 'Longview does work that is otherwise largely neglected by most philanthropists, but is critical both to achieving the right outcomes, and to advancing discussions about philanthropy's purpose. When I first met the team at Longview Philanthropy, I thought, \"This is the approach I've been waiting to be so well articulated, and this is the mission-driven team to execute it.\"'\n\nMartin Crowley, a professional poker player who raises money for charity, emailed me to say: 'Years ago, I found that there was no more inefficient market than charity selection and that some charities are a thousand times better than others. I support Longview because they help donors like me find and donate to the best charities.'\n\nHe added: 'If donors knew about these huge discrepancies in effectiveness, many of them would not just give more effectively, but give more generously and enthusiastically.'\n\nFor Cargill, who gives 10 per cent of her own relatively modest salary to charity, the pertinent question is not why billionaires would practise philanthropy, but why they would not. 'It's an immense privilege to be able to do something to improve the lives of your fellow humans, and it's a real shame not to take advantage of that if you can.'\n\nOr, as Chuck Feeney once said: 'I cannot think of a more personally rewarding and appropriate use of wealth than to give while one is living, to personally devote oneself to meaningful efforts to improve the human condition.'",

        "body": "The Foundation is partnering with more than 148 organizations leveraging artificial intelligence (AI) and data science to address the world's most urgent and complex challenges.\n\nBOSTON, Dec. 20, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- One year after the public was introduced to the transformative potential of generative AI, the AI landscape is garnering more attention than ever-and the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation is working to ensure that the public's interests are not left behind as technological innovation accelerates.\n\nToday, the Foundation announced $66.4 million in support to 148 organizations working to develop products, platforms, and policies that demonstrate AI's potential to be a force for good. Today's announcement confirms a landmark investment in an ecosystem of partners working to build AI for the public good.\n\n\"Our latest round of funding strengthens our support for what we call the 'missing middle,' the vast space of opportunity to leverage AI and data solutions for positive social impact in the near future,\" said Vilas Dhar, President of the Patrick J. McGovern Foundation. \"We're proud to invest in and partner with organizations developing purpose-driven AI and data approaches driving measurable and meaningful change in the lives of people around the world.\"\n\nThe grants will support AI development among organizations in more than a dozen countries, with many leveraging data analytics and machine learning (ML) to tackle existing complex social issues affecting frontline communities, including climate change, human rights abuses, and health inequity.\n\nThe grants also provide more than $12 million in support for global organizations and partnerships working to advocate for community-grounded, safe, secure, and responsible AI development through policy and research, including significant contributions to the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD), the Center for Democracy and Technology, and the AI Safety Fund-a joint effort between Google, Microsoft, Philanthropic, and Open AI, among others.\n\n\"With our partners, we share the belief that the improved understanding and use of technology, AI, and data science can radically transform our world for the better,\" said Nick Cain, the Foundation's Director of Strategic Grants. \"Our grantmaking strategy is guided by specific hypotheses about the interventions that are most likely to drive this transformation through the work of our diverse, values-aligned group of partners.\"\n\nIn addition to supporting partner organizations with grant funding, the Foundation continues to make strides to democratize access to AI through programmatic pathways designed to enhance nonprofit technical expertise and develop open-source solutions for the public sector.

With an aim to drive efficiency across growth and costs, we are reducing our workforce by 10 per cent and continue to drive innovation in India across payments and financial services,\" said a Paytm spokesperson.\n\nPaytm believes that its strong mobile-first foundation and early AI adoption will give it a competitive edge.\n\nThe company also feels that there is a need for upskilling and reskilling to equip employees for AI-enabled roles.\n\n\"We will be able to save the targeted 10-15 per cent that we had planned on employee costs, all because AI has actually delivered more than what we expected it to,\" Sharma said in his interview with Bloomberg.\n\nSharma also said that the company aims to hit EBITDA-level profitability sooner. It has generated free cash for the past two quarters and Sharma expects that trajectory to continue.",

The automation of tasks that traditionally relied on human intelligence has far-reaching implications, creating new opportunities for innovation and enabling businesses to reinvent their operations. By giving machines the growing capacity to learn, reason and make decisions, AI is impacting nearly every industry, from manufacturing to hospitality, healthcare and academia. Without an AI strategy, organizations risk missing out on the benefits AI can offer.\n\nAn AI strategy helps organizations address the complex challenges associated with AI implementation and define its objectives. Whether it's deeper data analysis, optimization of business processes or improved customer experiences, having a well-defined purpose and plan will ensure that the adoption of AI aligns with the broader business goals. This alignment is essential for extracting meaningful value from AI and maximizing its impact. A successful AI strategy will also provide a roadmap for addressing challenges, building necessary capabilities and ensuring a strategic and responsible application of AI into the fabric of the organization.\n\nOrganizations that make efforts to understand AI now and harness its power will thrive in the future. A robust AI strategy will enable these organizations to navigate the complexities of integrating AI, adapt quickly to technological advancements and optimize their processes, operational efficiency and overall growth.\n\nAn artificial intelligence strategy is simply a plan for integrating AI into an organization so that it aligns with and supports the broader goals of the business. A successful AI strategy should act as a roadmap for this plan. Depending on the organization's goals, the AI strategy might outline the steps to effectively use AI to extract deeper insights from data, enhance efficiency, build a better supply chain or ecosystem and/or improve talent and customer experiences.\n\nA well-formulated AI strategy should also help guide tech infrastructure, ensuring the business is equipped with the hardware, software and other resources needed for effective AI implementation. And since technology evolves so rapidly, the strategy should allow the organization to adapt to new technologies and shifts in the industry. Ethical considerations such as bias, transparency and regulatory concerns should also be addressed to support responsible deployment.\n\nAs artificial intelligence continues to impact almost every industry, a well-crafted AI strategy is imperative. It can help organizations unlock their potential, gain a competitive advantage and achieve sustainable success in the ever-changing digital era.\n\nBuilding an AI strategy offers many benefits to organizations venturing into artificial intelligence integration. An AI strategy allows organizations to purposefully harness AI capabilities and align AI initiatives with overall business objectives. The AI strategy becomes the compass for meaningful contributions to the organization's success. It empowers stakeholders to choose projects that will offer the biggest improvement in important processes such as productivity and decision-making as well as the bottom line.\n\nMore specifically, an AI strategy outlines the steps that will enable AI projects to smoothly transform ideas into impactful solutions. This calls for the organization to also make important decisions regarding data, talent and technology: A well-crafted strategy will provide a clear plan for managing, analyzing and leveraging data for AI initiatives. It will also determine the talent the organization needs to develop, attract or retain with relevant skills in data science, machine learning (ML) and AI development. It will also guide the procurement of the necessary hardware, software and cloud computing resources to ensure effective AI implementation.\n\nIn essence, a successful AI strategy is indispensable, acting as support for business objectives, facilitating prioritization, optimizing talent and technology choices and ensuring an organized integration of AI that will support organizational success.\n\nThe following steps are commonly used to help craft an effective artificial intelligence strategy:\n\nGain an understanding of various AI technologies, including generative AI, machine learning (ML), natural language processing, computer vision, etc. Research AI use cases to know where and how these technologies are being applied in relevant industries. List issues AI can address and the benefits to be gained. Note the departments that use it, their methods and any roadblocks.\n\nUnderstand the organization, its priorities and capabilities. Review the size and strength of the IT department, which will implement and manage AI systems. Interview department heads to identify potential issues AI could help solve.\n\nWhat problems does the organization need to solve? What metrics need to be improved? Don't assume AI is always the answer, choose business objectives that are important for the business and that AI has a track record of addressing successfully.\n\nFind companies in the AI and ML space that have worked within your industry. Create a list of potential tools, vendors and partnerships, evaluating their experience, reputation, pricing, etc. Prioritize procurement based on the phases and timeline of the AI integration project.\n\nCreate a roadmap that prioritizes early successes that will bring value to the business. Choose projects based on identified practical needs. Determine the tools and support needed and organize them based on what's most crucial for the project, specifically:\n\nPresent the AI strategy to stakeholders, ensuring it aligns with business objectives. Attain buy-in for the proposed roadmap. Clearly communicate the benefits, costs and expected results. Secure the necessary budget to implement the strategy.\n\nStart upskilling ai teams or hiring individuals with the right AI expertise. Encourage teams to stay updated on the cutting-edge AI advancements and to explore innovative problem-solving methods.\n\nUnderstand the ethical implications of the organization's responsible use of AI. Commit to ethical AI initiatives, inclusive governance models and actionable guidelines. Regularly monitor AI models for potential biases and implement fairness and transparency practices to address ethical concerns.\n\nKeep up with the fast-paced developments of new products and AI technologies. Adapt the organization's AI strategy based on new insights and emerging opportunities.\n\nFollowing these steps will enable the creation of a powerful guide for integrating AI into the organization. This will allow the business to take better advantage of opportunities in the dynamic world of artificial intelligence.\n\nSeveral issues can get in the way of building and implementing a successful AI strategy. Their potential to impede the process should be assessed early -- and issues dealt with accordingly -- to effectively move forward.\n\nHow and where is your data, really? AI models rely heavily on robust datasets, so insufficient access to relevant and high-quality data can undermine the strategy and the effectiveness of AI applications.\n\nA lack of awareness about AI's capabilities and potential applications may lead to skepticism, resistance or misinformed decision-making. This will drain any value from the strategy and block the successful integration of AI into the organization's processes.\n\nIf the AI initiatives are not closely tied to the organization's goals, priorities, and vision, it may result in wasted efforts, lack of support from leadership and an inability to demonstrate meaningful value.\n\nProfessionals are needed to effectively develop, implement and manage AI initiatives. A shortage of AI talent, such as data scientists or ML experts, or resistance from current employees to upskill, could impact the viability of the strategy.\n\nRecent developments within artificial intelligence (AI) have demonstrated the scale and power of this technology on business and society. However, businesses need to determine how to structure and govern these systems responsibly to avoid bias and errors as the scalability of AI technology can have costly effects to both business and society. As your organization uses different datasets to apply machine learning and automation to workflows, it's important to have the right guardrails in place to ensure data quality, compliance, and transparency within your AI systems.\n\nIBM can help you put AI into action now by focusing on the areas of your business where AI can deliver real benefits quickly and ethically.

        "title": "The AI Revolution May Favor Amazon and Meta More Than Alphabet",
        "body": "Artificial intelligence could be the next big step in digital platforms, providing a counterpart or in some places a replacement for the traditional Internet. Amazon.com and Facebook-owner Meta Platforms look like better bets on that future than Google-parent Alphabet, according to analysts at Raymond James.\n\nAmazon and Meta were both initiated at Strong Buy ratings by Raymond James analyst Josh Beck in a research note. While he was also positive on Alphabet, it got a slightly less enthusiastic Outperform rating due to caution about how generative AI will affect the economics of its core search business.\n\nBeck's vision of AI is that it will become an embedded operating system across nearly every digital consumer and business platform -- assisting with everything from to planning a vacation. He projected generative-AI-software revenue of around $100 billion within a couple of years, potentially approaching $300 billion in five years.\n\nAmazon comes out as a winner in that scenario due to its cloud-computing business Amazon Web Services and its associated for companies that need access to generative-AI tools and hardware. While Beck said he didn't expect generative AI to make a material contribution for Amazon in 2024, he expects it to add an aggregate $10 billion of annual recurring revenue in the years ahead.\n\nBeck initiated coverage of Amazon stock with a Strong Buy rating and a $185 target price, based on a multiple of 12.5 times 2025 estimates for enterprise value-to-earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization multiple.\n\nNewsletter Sign-up\n\nAmazon shares were up 0.8% to $154.89 in early trading Wednesday.\n\nMeta is also set to do well in Beck's analysis, although it has more to do with internal integration of than offering them to external customers. Engagement with its Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp platforms could be boosted by the application of AI to content recommendations, enabling sustained share gains in advertising budgets\n\n\"We expect elevated near-term AI investment intensity to ease in the years ahead, paving the way for improved incremental margins with an attractive valuation,\" Beck wrote.\n\nBeck initiated Meta stock at Strong Buy with a $425 target price, based on an EV-to-Ebitda multiple of 11.1 times for 2025.\n\nMeta shares were up 0.3% to $351.29 on Wednesday.\n\nAlphabet isn't exactly an AI loser in Beck's framework, but it has more to prove about how the economics of search will be affected. The Raymond James analyst said his base case is that Google's cost of answering queries is set to rise, and the company will have to show it has a to maintain or expand its dominant share of the search market.\n\nBeck initiated coverage of Alphabet stock with an Outperform rating and a target price of $150. Alphabet shares were up 2.4% at $139.86 on Wednesday.\n\nWrite to Adam Clark at",

        "title": "Bill Gates 'optimistic' about AI addressing global challenges",
        "body": "SALT LAKE CITY -- Earlier this year, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates warned emerging artificial intelligence tools were poised to fundamentally reshape the most popular uses of the internet, potentially killing off powerhouses like Google and Amazon and may eventually power a new wave of worker-droids.\n\nBut multibillionaire Gates, who stepped away from Microsoft's day-to-day operations in 2008 to engage in full-time philanthropic endeavors, focused on more optimistic potentials for AI in his annual year-end letter released Tuesday.\n\nAt a May artificial intelligence conference hosted by financial giant Goldman Sachs and Silicon Valley venture firm SV Angel, Gates said he believed a yet-to-be-developed AI-driven personal assistant is likely to take over humdrum human tasks like searching the internet, shopping and even engaging with online productivity tools. That's because the new digital helpers will be keyed in to users' needs in a way that will obsolesce many of the current, mainstay uses of the internet.\n\n\"Whoever wins the personal agent, that's the big thing, because you will never go to a search site again, you will never go to a productivity site, you'll never go to Amazon again,\" Gates said in May.\n\nHe also suggested that, in the future, AI-powered humanoid robots will become more affordable than human laborers and begin replacing blue-collar workers.\n\nGates chose, however, to focus on more altruistic potentials for artificial intelligence in a year-in-review posting Tuesday on his \"Gates Notes\" blog.\n\nGates said putting innovation to work has been a core motivator throughout his life and was the impetus behind Microsoft as well as the philanthropic organization, the Gates Foundation, which he and his ex-wife Melinda Gates founded in 1994.\n\nGates believes AI-powered innovations will begin fundamentally reshaping the world and he sees opportunity for the new technology to help abate some of the most critical issues facing humanity.\n\n\"In a world with limited resources, you have to find ways to maximize impact,\" Gates wrote. \"Innovation is the key to getting the most out of every dollar spent. And artificial intelligence is about to accelerate the rate of new discoveries at a pace we've never seen before.\"\n\nHere are some of the pressing questions Gates believes may be addressed by emerging AI tools:\n\nGates notes the work of Nana Kofi Quakyi from the Aurum Institute in Ghana who is working on an AI-powered tool that helps health workers prescribe antibiotics without contributing to antimicrobial resistance. The tool will comb through all the available information -- including local clinical guidelines and health surveillance data about which pathogens are currently at risk of developing resistance in the area -- and make suggestions for the best drug, dosage, and duration.\n\nCan AI bring personalized tutors to every student?\n\nGates is impressed with a number of new education-focused AI tools that are approaching the challenge by tailoring lessons to the needs of individual users while also incorporating culture-specific customization. Gates cites Khanmigo, MATHia and Somanasi as platforms that are showing positive outcomes with this approach.\n\nGates notes that, across the globe, a woman dies in childbirth every two minutes. Gates said he met earlier this year with researchers from ARMMAN, who hope to use artificial intelligence to improve the odds for new mothers in India. ARMMAN's large language model is being developed to act as a co-pilot for health workers treating high-risk pregnancies. It can be used in both English and Telugu, and automatically adjusts to the experience level of the person using it -- whether you're a brand-new nurse or a midwife with decades of experience.\n\nCould AI make medical information easier to access for every health worker?\n\nGates wrote about Maryam Mustafa's team, working on a voice-enabled mobile app that would make it a lot easier for maternal health workers in Pakistan to create medical records. It asks a series of prompts about a patient and uses the responses to fill out a standard medical record. Arming health workers with more data will hopefully improve the country's pregnancy outcomes, which are among the worst in the world.\n\nGates wrote in his year-end posting that \"it's clearer than ever how AI can be used to improve access to education, mental health, and more\" and pledged to support emerging AI-driven technologies aiming to better the world.\n\n\"It motivates me to make sure this technology helps reduce -- and doesn't contribute to -- the awful inequities we see around the world,\" Gates wrote. \"I've always been a firm believer in the power of innovation to offer every child an equal chance to survive and thrive. AI is no exception.\"",

        "title": "Translated's New MT Solution Fuses Advances in AI with Human Expertise to Deliver Real-Time Quality Improvements",
        "body": "ROME--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec 20, 2023--\n\nTranslated, a leading provider of AI-powered language solutions, today unveiled the first dynamic, adaptive machine translation (MT) system that enables enterprises to continually improve MT quality in real-time through a unique symbiosis between humans and machines. ModernMT's new Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) plan allows users to strategically allocate resources and scale the involvement of translators to ensure continuous improvement in MT at a faster rate than ever before. For the first time, the MT model improves daily through automated, targeted reviews that happen in the background while still delivering instant translations via the API, without sacrificing speed or scale.\n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231215811537/en/\n\nPreviously, MT buyers have had to rely on periodic evaluations or direct user feedback to understand where MT translations could be improved. Even with that information, updating the model is cumbersome, if even possible. The HITL plan addresses these obstacles with a 'Machine-First, Human-Optimized' approach. While suitable for all MT users, the new solution will be particularly effective for organizations that rely on raw MT output (e.g., in real-time and/or high-volume scenarios) and have no means of identifying potential issues in the output, or addressing them, in any regular or consistent way. This solution simplifies the process of monitoring quality and deciding where best to invest in improvements across languages and content types.\n\n\" Our Human-in-the-Loop plan reimagines adaptive machine translation for enterprises. It's designed to be dynamic, flexible, and deeply integrated with translator expertise, especially for large MT-driven projects, \" - said Marco Trombetti, CEO of Translated - \" This elegant solution enables organizations to monitor, plan, and invest in continuous MT quality improvement in a highly automated, cost-effective, and structured way.\"\n\nTranslated's HITL approach is a true innovation that combines the best elements of AI, highly skilled people, and efficient workflows, to allow enterprises to use MT to scale operations internationally.\n\nUsers can easily adjust what proportion of their machine translated content should be reviewed, from 0% (no review) upwards, in a new, easy-to-use interface. This can be done for any language combination and the user gets an instant estimate of cost variations. The system automatically selects which translations to review using a new AI-powered quality assessment feature that ultimately adapts to the users' content to identify the most appropriate segments for review.\n\nReviews are carried out by professional translators selected from Translated's community of over 300,000 vetted, native-speaking professionals. The most suitable translators for a given task are chosen by a proprietary, AI-powered tool that considers over 30 parameters, including past performance and availability. The MT engine is subsequently re-trained continuously with corrections it receives.\n\nThe new Human-in-the-Loop plan will be available to new and existing Translated customers directly at www.modernmt.com and through their account managers beginning December 19, 2023. Existing customers will have the option to upgrade to the new Human-in-the-Loop plan within the new ModernMT interface at any time.\n\nTranslated is hosting a live event for those interested in a deeper understanding of this innovation and how it can help them grow their business.\n\nView source version on businesswire.com:https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231215811537/en/\n\nCONTACT: Silvio Gulizia\n\nHead of Content\n\nMail:silvio@translated.com\n\nMob.: +39 393 1044785\n\nKEYWORD: ITALY EUROPE\n\nINDUSTRY KEYWORD: PROFESSIONAL SERVICES DATA MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY SOFTWARE VENTURE CAPITAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\n\nSOURCE: Translated\n\nCopyright Business Wire 2023.\n\nPUB: 12/20/2023 09:30 AM/DISC: 12/20/2023 09:31 AM\n\nhttp://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231215811537/en",

        "title": "Driving the Agenda: At an Eventful COP28, GE Leads the Charge on Multiple Climate Fronts | GE News",
        "body": "The annual U.N. Climate Change Conference (COP) is famous for being a global forum bringing together leaders, policymakers, and businesses, but it also provides a stage for the host country and the wider region to showcase their efforts in accelerating the energy transition.\n\nThis year's COP28 in Dubai, United Arab Emirates (UAE), was no different, as representatives from 130 governments pledged to triple the world's renewable energy capacity by 2030, while more than 20 countries from four continents launched the Declaration to Triple Nuclear Energy by 2050 and committed to accelerate the adoption of other technologies like hydrogen as fuel and carbon capture and sequestration. The UAE and participating countries used the event to champion climate action, urge renewables adoption, and promote global financing solutions, among other initiatives. Over the past couple of weeks, GE has taken on a key role in projects regionally and globally and demonstrated its readiness to employ innovation and technology to help countries accelerate the energy transition and innovate a smarter, more efficient future of flight.\n\nAs the saying goes, climate change is a global problem, and it needs global solutions. GE Vernova, whose installed base of technology helps generate approximately 30% of the world's electricity, acknowledged this opportunity in Dubai by announcing that it would join the First Movers Coalition (FMC), a group of companies leveraging their purchasing power and global footprint to decarbonize the world's heavy-emitting sectors.\n\nBy joining, GE Vernova made a voluntary commitment that at least 10% of all steel purchased will be near zero emissions by 2030. \"GE Vernova is proud to join the First Movers Coalition as we focus on accelerating the path to more reliable, affordable, and sustainable energy,\" said Scott Strazik, CEO of GE Vernova. \"As we continue our work to electrify and decarbonize the world, the FMC's initiative provides an important opportunity to succeed in product stewardship and energy at the same time.\"\n\nIn a first for the U.S. Center at COP28, Strazik also unveiled the U.S. Innovation: Pathways Toward Net Zero exhibit along with John Kerry, U.S. special presidential envoy for climate. Presented by the Corporate Coalition for Innovation & Technology Toward Net Zero (CCITNZ), which includes GE and nine other industrial leaders, the interactive exhibit features the latest American innovation and technology, including how GE Vernova is helping to electrify and decarbonize the world and how GE Aerospace is inventing the future of flight.\n\nNuclear power is critical to decarbonizing the energy sector and achieving the net zero carbon emission goals of the Paris Climate Agreement. GE Vernova's nuclear business, GE Hitachi Nuclear Energy, signed a memorandum of understanding (MoU) with the Emirates Nuclear Energy Corporation (ENEC) to identify investment and development opportunities in small modular reactor (SMR) technology. The MoU intends to explore opportunities for the deployment of GE Hitachi's innovative BWRX-300 reactor plant design in the Middle East and Africa, which is in line with the growing global interest in harnessing smaller, more flexible, and economically viable nuclear solutions.\n\nThe MoU is part of the new ENEC ADVANCE program, which aims to expedite and centralize the UAE's approach to deploying state-of-the-art nuclear technology. \"It is a testament to our leading role in the future of clean energy in the region as we explore the integration of advanced nuclear technologies and the use of state-of-the-art SMRs around the world,\" said Mohamed Ibrahim Al Hammadi, ENEC's chief executive officer.\n\nGE Aerospace is also helping to accelerate a more sustainable future of flight. On the eve of COP28, Dubai-based Emirates became the first airline to operate an Airbus A380, the world's largest passenger airliner, using 100% sustainable aviation fuel (SAF) in one of its engines. The jet used conventional jet fuel in three of its four Engine Alliance* GP7200 engines and 100% SAF in the fourth engine, marking another milestone in the industry's growing momentum to bring standardization, certification, and adoption of 100% SAF closer to reality. Take a look at how GE Aerospace made progress to reduce emissions in 2023.\n\nSupporting Korea's Domestic Hydrogen Ecosystem\n\nGE Vernova looks to engage globally on breakthrough decarbonization technology. To that end, together with SK E&S Co. Ltd., GE Vernova signed a multi-party MoU with Chungcheongnam Province, Air Liquide S.A., Santos Ltd., and Korea Midland Power Co. Ltd. to develop a large-scale low-carbon hydrogen value chain in South Korea, which will consist of a low-carbon hydrogen production plant, a hydrogen power plant, and a trans-boundary carbon storage site. As part of the collaboration, GE Vernova will endeavor to provide the technology for the hydrogen plant.\n\nThe signing was performed at a ceremony at the Korean pavilion at COP28 in Dubai, attended by Roger Martella, GE and GE Vernova chief sustainability officer. \"GE Vernova and Korea share a proud commitment to innovation, and we look forward to partnering with leading companies in Korea to help achieve carbon neutrality goals by 2050,\" said Martella.\n\nDuring COP28, GE Vernova announced a collaboration with Alfanar Construction and the Saudi Electric Company (SEC) to transition a large fleet of its 7E turbines to run on natural gas instead of liquid fuels at the 3.5-gigawatt (GW) Power Plant 10 (PP10) in Riyadh, one of the largest power stations in the world, and help the country meet its carbon reduction goals.\n\n\"Following this project's completion, each gas turbine's efficiency is expected to increase by up to 0.3% and to generate up to 1.7 million fewer tons of carbon dioxide (CO) emissions per year for the same amount of power generated,\" said Joseph Anis, president and CEO of GE Vernova's Gas Power business in Europe, the Middle East, and Africa. In fact, the benefits are twofold: The efficiency gains will help to boost PP10's actual power output by up to 4%.\n\nGE Vernova is also assisting nearby Kuwait, which is seeking to generate 15% of its power from renewables by 2030, to reduce emissions and improve asset reliability, availability, and productivity. It signed a five-year agreement with TNB REMACO-Al Dhow, a Malaysian-Kuwaiti joint venture, to provide services to the gas turbines at the 878-megawatt (MW) Shuaiba North Power Station facility in Al Ahmadi, Kuwait, and help that nation to modernize its power generation infrastructure.\n\nIt's estimated that the cost of achieving a global net zero energy transition by 2050 will be nearly $300 trillion, and GE Vernova is helping lead efforts to source and secure the capital required to do so. In Dubai, GE Vernova's Financial Services business signed a MoU with the Islamic Corporation for the Insurance of Investment and Export Credit (ICIEC), which provides investment and export credit insurance for entities in member states. The MOU, which leverages ICIEC's insurance and credit enhancement solutions alongside GE Vernova's renewable energy expertise, will enable sustainable development and climate action across ICIEC's 49 member states.\n\n\"This partnership reflects our dedication to fostering economic growth while adhering to the principles of Shariah and upholding the highest environmental and social standards,\" said Oussama Kaissi, the chief executive of ICIEC.\n\n\"We're thrilled to work with ICIEC on this exciting advancement toward funding and developing impactful energy transition projects in the region,\" added Nomi Ahmad, CEO of GE Energy Financial Services, \"and look forward to the progress this partnership can create, in line with GE Vernova's mission to electrify and decarbonize the world.\"\n\nGE Vernova's Digital business spread the word at COP28 about new software solutions the company has developed that can help the industry work more constructively toward lowering CO emissions. For example, the CERius software solution employs artificial intelligence to gather more accurate emissions data, which can assist customers in reducing carbon emissions over time.\n\nIn a recent article in Oil & Gas Middle East, Linda Rae, general manager of power generation and oil and gas software at Digital, noted that \"digital software is already making a difference across industry and the globe when it comes to reducing emissions as these technologies exist today. However, digital software adoption is not happening fast enough and at scale to move the emissions needle.\" New software solutions like CERius, she said, \"will help the energy sector, especially the hard-to-abate industries, identify where and when are the best opportunities to apply those abatement strategies and spend money most effectively.\"\n\nAs GE prepares to launch GE Aerospace and GE Vernova as independent companies in the beginning of the second quarter, the company is advancing its commitment to sustainability and climate action, drawing on GE's more than 130-year legacy of lifting up the quality of life for people around the world. By sharpening its focus on the specific missions of each business, GE is gaining more opportunity for GE Vernova to electrify and decarbonize the world and for GE Aerospace to invent the future of flight.",

        "title": "Middle market business leaders maintain confidence despite ongoing uncertainty - Utah Business",
        "body": "It should come as no surprise that many middle market business leaders are focused on expansion, given their positive outlook. Over the past six months, 66 percent of those with a positive company outlook have increased funding plans to invest in or expand their businesses. Nearly half of those surveyed (47 percent) plan to add employees, 46 percent will make process improvements, and 40 percent will introduce new products.\n\nMoreover, the number of middle market businesses planning to expand or renovate their current facilities increased significantly throughout 2023, from 25 percent in March to 36 percent in September.\n\nTechnology will play a major role in 2024 growth plans. Half of business owners and executives surveyed will expand their use of technology or automation over the next six months -- and among companies at the larger end of the middle-market spectrum (revenue between $500 million and $2 billion), that figure increases to nearly two-thirds (63 percent). Middle market business leaders are also exploring opportunities around artificial intelligence (AI): 42 percent overall and 63 percent of those in the higher revenue category plan to implement AI for combating fraud, analyzing data and automating simple tasks. These leaders identify a wide variety of benefits emerging from AI adoption, including faster and more accurate customer service, improved productivity and better decision-making.\n\nThe top three challenges currently negatively impacting middle market businesses are the overall increase in inflation (46 percent), higher labor costs (35 percent) and higher energy costs (32 percent).\n\nWhile inflation continues to top the list of current concerns, business leaders are divided about its overall impact on their organizations over the past six months. Thirty-two percent report that the positive impacts of inflation outweighed the negative, 30 percent said the positives were equal to the negatives, and 33 percent said negative impacts outweighed the positive. Higher numbers of middle market business owners and executives in the retail sector reported positive effects of inflation (44 percent), as did those with revenues above $250 million (42 percent). Among business leaders who reported positive effects of inflation, 51 percent cited the ability to increase prices, 44 percent cited increased incentives for the business to spend or invest, and 43 percent named increased customer spending as a primary benefit.\n\nTurning to people issues, nearly half of middle market business owners and executives report that their growth plans include adding more employees to their workforces over the next six months. Forty-one percent of survey respondents expect finding talent over that period to be easy or very easy. Positive sentiment about talent acquisition is more prevalent among those with a positive outlook on the U.S. economy (67 percent), from firms with $500 million or more in revenue (55 percent), and in the construction industry (51 percent). Conversely, 39 percent of middle market business leaders anticipate finding talent to fill their open positions will be difficult or very difficult. This is especially true in the Midwest (55 percent), in the health care industry (50 percent) and for companies with revenue in the $25 million-$50 million range (50 percent).\n\nThis quarter, the top method for attracting talent among business leaders who anticipate hiring challenges is implementing or enhancing health and wellness benefits. More than half (53 percent) reported taking this approach in September, a significant increase from 41 percent in June. The number of respondents offering job training and educational benefits as a means to attract new workers is also on the rise, at 34 percent from 29 percent previously.\n\nFewer middle market business owners and executives are concerned about retaining their existing talent than attracting new workers. Among the 20 percent who anticipate challenges in this area over the next six months, improving the competitiveness of wages and salaries is the most cited method for talent retention (56 percent versus 45 percent last quarter). The number of respondents who are enhancing their efforts to create a safe working environment at company offices and physical locations is also on the rise, from 21 percent in June to 31 percent in September.\n\nAs interest rates remain elevated, concerns about higher borrowing costs are on the rise -- especially in the near term. As of September, higher borrowing costs were tied with higher oil and gas prices as the top issue expected to negatively affect middle market businesses' bottom lines during the fourth quarter of 2023.\n\nTwenty-four percent of middle market business owners and executives anticipate higher borrowing costs to negatively impact their businesses within the next 12 months, compared to only 15 percent in the second quarter. Of those respondents, more than half (52 percent) expect it to be a problem in the next three months and 83 percent anticipate a negative impact on their bottom line within the next six months. In response, middle market business leaders are exploring new sources of capital and credit, including private equity firms (55 percent), commercial lenders (46 percent) and the use of multiple banks (43 percent). In the current rate environment, business leaders may benefit from reviewing and updating their liquidity strategies.\n\nThe year 2023 has imposed a host of challenges on middle market businesses -- and between a potential downturn, ongoing geopolitical conflict, and what promises to be a tumultuous election year, it looks like uncertainty and volatility will continue in the year ahead. Yet in the face of these challenges, middle market business leaders are maintaining their resolve, managing for growth and making plans to expand. This vital segment of the economy has proven its resilience in recent years, and the optimism shown by many middle market business owners and executives seems warranted as they approach 2024.",

        "title": "Wolters Kluwer leaders predict accelerated AI transformation for healthcare in 2024",
        "body": "WALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec 20, 2023--\n\nAs 2024 nears, the healthcare landscape is undergoing unprecedented transformations, particularly with headlines about artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, and Generative AI (GenAI) in particular, promising to reshape how healthcare is delivered. To shed light on anticipated trends and innovations impacting the healthcare industry in 2024, leading experts from across Wolters Kluwer Health offer their expectations for healthcare AI in 2024. Cutting through the hype, the predictions offer a compelling narrative of what's ahead and guide us toward a more informed, connected, and resilient future in healthcare.\n\nTop 4 impact-drivers for generative AI in 2024\n\n\"2024 will be a watershed year for GenAI, particularly in healthcare. Look for solutions emerging in four key areas in 2024: lightening administrative burdens across the hospital; helping sharpen clinicians' decision-making; boosting the efficiency of medical researchers; and helping the next generation of healthcare workers ramp up proficiency with smarter learning tools.\"\n\nStacey Caywood, CEO of Wolters Kluwer Health\n\nGenAI is here to stay: for clinical decision support, easing bottlenecks\n\n\"The adoption of artificial intelligence in the clinical setting will continue to evolve, particularly with generative AI for clinical decision support, as healthcare organizations begin piloting and evaluating these solutions for responsible and safe patient care applications. GenAI has the potential to help clinicians make decisions more accurately and efficiently at the point of care.\"\n\n\"The capabilities of AI will far outpace the scaled-up adoption of AI applications, which are constrained by workflow, competing priorities and economic considerations driving uptake. We expect most of the uptake to be dominated by existing workflow applications such as EMRs and related services like documentation, although operational applications such as nurse scheduling, revenue cycle management, and prior authorization will also get an AI boost.\"\n\nPeter Bonis, MD, Chief Medical Officer of Wolters Kluwer Health\n\nBuilding trust into healthcare GenAI: content quality is the critical driver in 2024\n\n\"Leveraging GenAI with clinical decision support could provide a way for providers to make faster and better decisions. We predict as healthcare explores GenAI and patient care, the source and vetting of the underlying content will become a key factor in the speed in which it is deployed. It is said that innovation happens at the speed of trust - in healthcare that trust is based on the quality of the underlying content and its evidence base.\"\n\nGreg Samios, President & Chief Executive Officer of Clinical Effectiveness at Wolters Kluwer Health\n\nFrom rat's nest to ready: taming health data for AI prime-time\n\n\"Health organizations are making it a strategic priority to extract more value from the volumes of data they're moving to the cloud. One big health data target in 2024? Training AI models on all that data. To make it happen however, they'll first need to untangle a rat's nest of messy data. In the race to build data-rich AI models in '24, many will turn to AI-driven terminology tech that speeds normalization of data, making it ready for prime-time.\"\n\nBrian Laberge, Solutions Engineer, Health Language at Wolters Kluwer Health\n\nThe AI has to be right: the role of AI in nursing education\n\n\"In 2024, we will see students and professors continue to experiment with the use of AI in education. Both students and educators are looking for ways to improve the traditional workflows of the classroom. By leveraging AI, faculty can reduce some of the workload burden with development of lesson plans, and more efficiently testing student knowledge and adjusting learning accordingly. For students, the proper use of AI can give them access to trusted learning materials in an easier to find, and digestible, conversational format.\"\n\n\"Education companies will act as fast movers since they are already dealing with time-pressed students - who are also savvy consumers - who expect to be engaged and leverage personalized study resources. For medical and nursing education, the AI has to be right - students must graduate clinically competent and confident, and they cannot learn from content that is not evidence-based, current and accurate. While there are many discussions and pilots happening currently, 2024 will be the year we see both of these groups push their institutions for real-life implementations.\"\n\nJulie Stegman, Vice President, Health Learning & Practice at Wolters Kluwer Health\n\nBuilding the future on Wolters Kluwer's solid AI foundation\n\nIn healthcare, trust is at the center of every interaction. A recent Wolters Kluwer survey found consumers worry about a lack of transparency in the origins of information being used by GenAI. Most need to know the company behind the GenAI has a long track record in healthcare. ( Survey executive summary )\n\nAround 50% of Wolters Kluwer's digital revenues now come from products that leverage artificial intelligence. Wolters Kluwer products, services and expert solutions are based on a foundation of trust, transparency, and responsibility - in line with the company's values. Wolters Kluwer's AI Principles guide the design, development, and deployment of advanced technologies in helping customers solve their most complex problems -- in healthcare and beyond.\n\nAbout Wolters Kluwer\n\nWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information, software, and services for professionals in healthcare, tax and accounting, financial and corporate compliance, legal and regulatory, and corporate performance and ESG.

        "title": "The future of generative AI: Here's what technology analysts are saying",
        "body": "Technology analysts have an optimistic view of generative AI and its impact on the future of the enterprise.\n\nAccording to 2023 research, most people are concerned about the implications of generative AI on data security, ethics, and bias. In fact, 81% of customers want a human to be in the loop, reviewing and validating generative AI outputs.\n\nA mere 37% of customers trust AI's outputs to be as accurate as those of an employee. The research found that the trust gap widens as AI goes mainstream. Brands are turning to generative AI to boost efficiency while improving customer engagement. Customers -- wary of the technology risks -- demand a thoughtful approach built on trust. Eighty percent of customers say it's important for humans to validate AI's outputs.\n\nAlso: Two breakthroughs made 2023 tech's most innovative year in over a decade\n\nDemystifying AI could significantly reduce the fear surrounding it. If we can move AI from an opaque black box to a transparent glass cube, we can recalibrate how we adopt the technology. A strong argument can be made that every AI foundational model must have a FICO score.\n\nThe latest State of IT 2023 Report by Salesforce, a survey of 4,300 IT decision-makers and leaders, found that 9 out of 10 CIOs believe generative AI has gone mainstream. The report found that AI and automation underpin efficiency and innovation. Process automation is on the rise as businesses tighten their belts and seek efficiency boosts, while advances in AI prompt IT to determine how -- not if -- to responsibly propel their organizations forward. Eighty-six percent of IT leaders believe generative AI will have a prominent role in their organizations in the near future.\n\nAccording to McKinsey, 50% of organizations used AI in 2022. IDC is forecasting global AI spending to increase a staggering 26.9% in 2023 alone. A recent survey of customer service professionals found adoption of AI had risen by 88% between 2020 and 2022.\n\nMcKinsey's latest research estimates that generative AI could add the equivalent of $2.6 trillion to $4.4 trillion annually across the 63 use cases. Generative AI will revolutionize the way we work.\n\nAlso: AI in 2023: A year of breakthroughs that left no human thing unchanged\n\nAI is the electricity of the 21st century. Ignore it and your business will be left in the dark. After all, we already know many ways that generative AI will shape how we work.\n\nA survey suggests AI has the potential to automate 40% of the average work day, according to research firm Valoir. The widespread use of generative artificial intelligence has raised public awareness of its ability to increase productivity and efficiency, as well as its risks.\n\nSo, what are the largest and most influential technology analyst firms saying about the impact of generative AI on the future of work and the enterprise? According to Gartner, generative AI will make an increasingly strong impact on enterprises over the next five years. Gartner predicts that:\n\nGenerative AI is positioned on the Peak of Inflated Expectations on the Gartner Hype Cycle for Emerging Technologies, 2023. Here are Gartner's top 10 strategic predictions:\n\nIDC believes that the tech industry is at a seminal moment. Never have we seen a technology emerge with this much executive support, clearly defined business outcomes, and rapid adoption.\n\nAlso: These 5 major tech advances of 2023 were the biggest game-changers\n\nIDC has identified three broad types of generative AI use cases that need to be assessed that are industry specific, business function, and productivity-related.\n\nIDC notes that the landscape of business may be seeing a seismic shift with the rise of generative AI. IDC advises business leaders to start with the following solid foundation:\n\nIDC also notes that data serves as the foundation for generative AI. When IDC surveyed clients about their data, troubling results were revealed.\n\nAI will radically reshape IT, according to IDC. Code generation, enterprise content management, marketing, and customer experience applications are some of the key areas for generative AI use cases in the enterprise, per IDC. IDC forecasts enterprise spending on GenAI services, software and infrastructure will grow from $16 billion in 2023 to $143 billion in 2027. Spending on generative AI over the four-year period to 2027 is expected to reach a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 73.3%.\n\nForrester research points to the next generation of modern software development, where generative AI TuringBots speed and improve software development. Forrester defines TuringBots as: AI-powered software that augments application development and infrastructure and operations teams' automation and semiautonomous capabilities to plan, analyze, design, code, test, deliver, and deploy while providing assistive intelligence on code, development processes, and applications.\n\nAlso: Today's AI boom will amplify social problems if we don't act now, says AI ethicist\n\nForrester predicts that TuringBots will write 10% of worldwide code and tests. Here are additional Forrester generative AI predictions for the enterprise:\n\nForrester predicts that Generative AI will be the fulcrum that businesses rely on to enhance, empower, and engage employees and customers -- with or without you. Forrester's predictions on AI include:\n\nGenerative AI dominated the top 10 emerging technologies of 2023 report by Forrester. The research notes that generative AI will strain most firms' ability to take risks and make good bets on emerging technology. Forrester research on the impact of generative AI on marketing notes the benefits of scale and precision to marketing. The research identifies the following benefits: 1. enhancing human intuition with intelligence; 2. amplifying creators' work; and 3. adding scale and speed to creative quality.\n\nConstellation Research believes generative AI will supercharge the future of work. The research notes that many work tasks will benefit from between a 1.3x to 5x gain in speed alone. Constellation research advice on the adoption of generative AI in the digital workplace is to have the following:\n\nConstellation also provides a list of the leading generative AI enterprise grade solutions. Constellation also breaks down the impact of generative AI by industry. For the education industry, Constellation notes that Generative AI, which appears to be initially loved by students and loathed by educators, is coming to education as its embedded in courseware as well as learning-management systems. The overall forecasts are optimistic, but there are cautionary notes about guardrails for AI.\n\nVentana Research highlights how generative AI helps sales and marketing in practical ways. Ventana notes: \"For marketing, one way this will happen is by improving the efficiency of marketing copy and potentially enabling personalization at scale. For field sales, the suggestions are that generative AI will improve both the ability of sales to craft emails for outreach and responses and to enhance presentations. Other use cases include using generative AI to summarize calls automatically and post them to the associated opportunity record, improving both accuracy and timeliness. This will have positive effects on sales productivity, but on its own will represent less a revolution than an evolution.\"\n\nBy 2025, more than one-quarter of sales organizations will utilize generative AI to auto-summarize meetings, personalize outreach at scale, and generate tailored sales enablement to improve sales productivity and allow more time for direct sales engagement to improve win rates, according to Ventana. The use of AI to advance automation and enhance efficiency is another example of intelligent automation as a powerful tool for CIOs.\n\nAlso: ChatGPT is the most sought out tech skill in the workforce, says learning platform\n\nFrom Sept. 12-14, I attended the largest AI conference in the world, Salesforce Dreamforce. I met with technology analysts from all of the institutions listed above and more, to learn more about their latest points of view on the data revolution, generative AI market trends, and use-case forecasts for the next 12-18 months. I captured and followed up with updates here on the impact of generative AI on the future of work and enterprise.",

        "title": "Apple (AAPL) Tops $3T Milestone: More Upside Left for 2024?",
        "body": "In December, Apple Inc. AAPL once again became a $3 trillion company for the first time in about four months. Apple's shares have easily outperformed the broader S&P 500 so far this year (+51.5% versus +24.1%). Moreover, Apple's shares are on track to register the best annual gains since 2020, when it soared 81%.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nHowever, 2023 hasn't been smooth sailing for Apple as it has had to deal with a plethora of macroeconomic bottlenecks that adversely impacted spending patterns across the consumer tech sector. Foreign exchange headwinds, in particular, dragged Apple's revenues during fiscal 2023, which ended in September.\n\nBut it's also true that Apple's revenues during the first half of fiscal 2023 declined 4% year over year, while it had fallen only 1% in the second half, a tell-tale sign that revenue trends are improving. To top it off, Samsung and Alphabet Inc.'s GOOGL smartphone shipments tanked more than Apple's iPhone shipments in recent times, indicating the company's dominance in the tech sector despite vulnerability to economic and geopolitical issues.\n\nMost importantly, Apple is overshadowing recent challenges due to its loyal customer base. Apple's devices are being used worldwide, and the company takes pride in having more than two billion active devices. CEO Luca Maestri, on the latest earnings call, confirmed that users of Apple's devices are growing at a nice pace, which should certainly boost the company's profit margins soon.\n\nDue to the immense brand loyalty that Apple relishes, its shares have been able to outdo its peers in the long run. For instance, over the past five-year period, shares of Apple have surged 422.3%, while shares of Microsoft Corporation MSFT, Amazon.com, Inc. AMZN, and Alphabet have gone up 279.9%, 122.8%, and 175.8%, respectively.\n\nImage Source: Zacks Investment Research\n\nNonetheless, Apple is well-poised to outperform its competitors next year as well due to the strength of its services business. Apple, traditionally a hardware company, is now finding it difficult to come up with breakthrough innovations in its smartphones, tablets and various other devices.\n\nHowever, Apple's service division, which includes Apple Pay, subscriptions, and licensing fees, continues to provide a steady stream of income. An increase in transaction accounts, and recurring billing due to Apple's large customer base is helping its revenues from services grow by leaps and bounds.\n\nAfter the iPhone, Apple's services business is at present becoming the highest-earnings segment. In reality, revenues from the services segment increased 9% year over year in fiscal 2023, while net iPhone sales dropped 2%. Therefore, it is not startling that Apple is currently placing a lot more priority on its digital offerings than product sales.\n\nApple's services segment, by the way, is also well-unified with its hardware segment, which binds the customers to its ecosystem. This means that users are less likely to purchase non-Apple products, which eventually bodes well for the company.\n\nApple is also heavily investing in the artificial intelligence (AI) boom. AAPL is focusing on generative AI, and its outlays on AI-related research and development increased by more than $3 billion this year.\n\nThe AI market in itself is expected to explode, with Bloomberg Intelligence estimating the market to expand to $1.3 trillion in the next 10-year period from just $40 billion in 2022. Thus, it's quite evident that Apple's initiative to venture into the AI field will benefit the organization immeasurably in the near future.\n\nThus, banking on dependable customers, strength in the services segment, and developments in the AI field, Apple's expected earnings growth for next year increased by 8.2%. Its projected earnings growth rate for the next five-year period also surged 11%.\n\nApple's net profit margin, meanwhile, is a solid 25.3%, and as a rule of thumb, above 20% is already a high margin. That means the company is in a position to generate enough profit from its sales, and its operational costs are under control. All these positives should certainly help Apple's shares scale northward. Apple, presently, has a Zacks Rank #3 (Hold).

        "title": "Developed-Market Stocks Eye Record As U.S. Leads $11 Trillion Run",
        "body": "A stellar year on Wall Street is propelling the biggest rally since 2019 in the MSCI World Index of developed-market equities, pushing the gauge closer to its record high and leaving emerging-market peers trailing far behind.\n\nThe global benchmark is now just 3% from its all-time peak after climbing 21% this year, while the MSCI Emerging Markets Index is up 4%. The U.S. stock market has been a major driving force, with the S&P 500 also a few points shy of its highest-ever level and the Nasdaq 100 on track for its best annual performance since 1999.\n\nThe U.S. is home to 28 of the 30 biggest contributors to the MSCI World benchmark's advance -- including Apple Inc. and Nvidia Corp. Novo Nordisk A/S breaks the U.S. shutout at 14th spot, thanks to the frenzy around weight-loss drugs, while Toyota Motor Corp. takes 29th position.\n\nDeveloped-market stocks have added almost $11 trillion to the value of the world index as economies held up better than expected and optimism grew that central banks will pivot to monetary easing. Enthusiasm around artificial intelligence ignited gains in U.S. stocks in particular, boosting the likes of Nvidia and Microsoft Corp. Japanese equities also soared, lifted by the return of inflation and as a weaker yen supported the earnings of heavy-weight exporters.\n\nPositive sentiment toward U.S. stocks should carry on next year, with strategists from Bank of America Corp., Goldman Sachs Group Inc. and Oppenheimer Asset Management among those seeing the S&P 500 index at 5,000 points or higher over the next 12 months as interest rates fall and \"U.S. exceptionalism\" continues.\n\nThat said, sentiment and positioning might have turned too bullish for now, with RBC Capital Markets and Citigroup Inc. strategists warning of the risk of a near-term pullback. Some technical indicators are also flashing warning signs after the rally since late October, with the S&P 500's relative strength index showing the benchmark is now the most overbought since September 2020.\n\n\"The market does not want to listen, even with Fed speakers pushing back,\" said Marija Veitmane, senior multi-asset strategist at State Street Global Markets. \"Over the last month, the market has priced a very aggressive cutting cycle and assumes that we are going to see a further decline in inflation, while only a minor deterioration in the growth outlook. So economic data needs to come 'just right.' Anything that is too hot or too cold is going to cause market upset.\"",

        "title": "Translated's New MT Solution Fuses Advances in AI with Human Expertise to Deliver Real-Time Quality Improvements",
        "body": "ROME--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec 20, 2023--\n\nTranslated, a leading provider of AI-powered language solutions, today unveiled the first dynamic, adaptive machine translation (MT) system that enables enterprises to continually improve MT quality in real-time through a unique symbiosis between humans and machines. ModernMT's new Human-in-the-Loop (HITL) plan allows users to strategically allocate resources and scale the involvement of translators to ensure continuous improvement in MT at a faster rate than ever before. For the first time, the MT model improves daily through automated, targeted reviews that happen in the background while still delivering instant translations via the API, without sacrificing speed or scale.\n\nThis press release features multimedia. View the full release here: https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231215811537/en/\n\nPreviously, MT buyers have had to rely on periodic evaluations or direct user feedback to understand where MT translations could be improved. Even with that information, updating the model is cumbersome, if even possible. The HITL plan addresses these obstacles with a 'Machine-First, Human-Optimized' approach. While suitable for all MT users, the new solution will be particularly effective for organizations that rely on raw MT output (e.g., in real-time and/or high-volume scenarios) and have no means of identifying potential issues in the output, or addressing them, in any regular or consistent way. This solution simplifies the process of monitoring quality and deciding where best to invest in improvements across languages and content types.\n\n\" Our Human-in-the-Loop plan reimagines adaptive machine translation for enterprises. It's designed to be dynamic, flexible, and deeply integrated with translator expertise, especially for large MT-driven projects, \" - said Marco Trombetti, CEO of Translated - \" This elegant solution enables organizations to monitor, plan, and invest in continuous MT quality improvement in a highly automated, cost-effective, and structured way.\"\n\nTranslated's HITL approach is a true innovation that combines the best elements of AI, highly skilled people, and efficient workflows, to allow enterprises to use MT to scale operations internationally.\n\nUsers can easily adjust what proportion of their machine translated content should be reviewed, from 0% (no review) upwards, in a new, easy-to-use interface. This can be done for any language combination and the user gets an instant estimate of cost variations. The system automatically selects which translations to review using a new AI-powered quality assessment feature that ultimately adapts to the users' content to identify the most appropriate segments for review.\n\nReviews are carried out by professional translators selected from Translated's community of over 300,000 vetted, native-speaking professionals. The most suitable translators for a given task are chosen by a proprietary, AI-powered tool that considers over 30 parameters, including past performance and availability. The MT engine is subsequently re-trained continuously with corrections it receives.\n\nThe new Human-in-the-Loop plan will be available to new and existing Translated customers directly at www.modernmt.com and through their account managers beginning December 19, 2023. Existing customers will have the option to upgrade to the new Human-in-the-Loop plan within the new ModernMT interface at any time.\n\nTranslated is hosting a live event for those interested in a deeper understanding of this innovation and how it can help them grow their business.\n\nView source version on businesswire.com:https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231215811537/en/\n\nCONTACT: Silvio Gulizia\n\nHead of Content\n\nMail:silvio@translated.com\n\nMob.: +39 393 1044785\n\nKEYWORD: ITALY EUROPE\n\nINDUSTRY KEYWORD: PROFESSIONAL SERVICES DATA MANAGEMENT TECHNOLOGY SOFTWARE VENTURE CAPITAL ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE\n\nSOURCE: Translated\n\nCopyright Business Wire 2023.\n\nPUB: 12/20/2023 09:30 AM/DISC: 12/20/2023 09:31 AM\n\nhttp://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20231215811537/en",

        "title": "Wolters Kluwer leaders predict accelerated AI transformation for healthcare in 2024",
        "body": "GenAI excitement to spur broader health AI innovation in 2024\n\nWALTHAM, Mass.--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- As 2024 nears, the healthcare landscape is undergoing unprecedented transformations, particularly with headlines about artificial intelligence (AI) technologies, and Generative AI (GenAI) in particular, promising to reshape how healthcare is delivered. To shed light on anticipated trends and innovations impacting the healthcare industry in 2024, leading experts from across Wolters Kluwer Health offer their expectations for healthcare AI in 2024. Cutting through the hype, the predictions offer a compelling narrative of whatâs ahead and guide us toward a more informed, connected, and resilient future in healthcare.\n\nTop 4 impact-drivers for generative AI in 2024\n\nâ2024 will be a watershed year for GenAI, particularly in healthcare. Look for solutions emerging in four key areas in 2024: lightening administrative burdens across the hospital; helping sharpen clinicians' decision-making; boosting the efficiency of medical researchers; and helping the next generation of healthcare workers ramp up proficiency with smarter learning tools.â\n\nStacey Caywood, CEO of Wolters Kluwer Health\n\nGenAI is here to stay: for clinical decision support, easing bottlenecks\n\nâThe adoption of artificial intelligence in the clinical setting will continue to evolve, particularly with generative AI for clinical decision support, as healthcare organizations begin piloting and evaluating these solutions for responsible and safe patient care applications. GenAI has the potential to help clinicians make decisions more accurately and efficiently at the point of care.â\n\nâThe capabilities of AI will far outpace the scaled-up adoption of AI applications, which are constrained by workflow, competing priorities and economic considerations driving uptake. We expect most of the uptake to be dominated by existing workflow applications such as EMRs and related services like documentation, although operational applications such as nurse scheduling, revenue cycle management, and prior authorization will also get an AI boost.â\n\nPeter Bonis, MD, Chief Medical Officer of Wolters Kluwer Health\n\nBuilding trust into healthcare GenAI: content quality is the critical driver in 2024\n\nâLeveraging GenAI with clinical decision support could provide a way for providers to make faster and better decisions. We predict as healthcare explores GenAI and patient care, the source and vetting of the underlying content will become a key factor in the speed in which it is deployed. It is said that innovation happens at the speed of trust â\" in healthcare that trust is based on the quality of the underlying content and its evidence base.â\n\nGreg Samios, President & Chief Executive Officer of Clinical Effectiveness at Wolters Kluwer Health\n\nFrom ratâs nest to ready: taming health data for AI prime-time\n\nâHealth organizations are making it a strategic priority to extract more value from the volumes of data they're moving to the cloud. One big health data target in 2024? Training AI models on all that data. To make it happen however, they'll first need to untangle a rat's nest of messy data. In the race to build data-rich AI models in '24, many will turn to AI-driven terminology tech that speeds normalization of data, making it ready for prime-time.â\n\nBrian Laberge, Solutions Engineer, Health Language at Wolters Kluwer Health\n\nThe AI has to be right: the role of AI in nursing education\n\nâIn 2024, we will see students and professors continue to experiment with the use of AI in education. Both students and educators are looking for ways to improve the traditional workflows of the classroom. By leveraging AI, faculty can reduce some of the workload burden with development of lesson plans, and more efficiently testing student knowledge and adjusting learning accordingly. For students, the proper use of AI can give them access to trusted learning materials in an easier to find, and digestible, conversational format.â\n\nâEducation companies will act as fast movers since they are already dealing with time-pressed students â\" who are also savvy consumers â\" who expect to be engaged and leverage personalized study resources. For medical and nursing education, the AI has to be right â\" students must graduate clinically competent and confident, and they cannot learn from content that is not evidence-based, current and accurate. While there are many discussions and pilots happening currently, 2024 will be the year we see both of these groups push their institutions for real-life implementations.â\n\nJulie Stegman, Vice President, Health Learning & Practice at Wolters Kluwer Health\n\nBuilding the future on Wolters Kluwerâs solid AI foundation\n\nIn healthcare, trust is at the center of every interaction. A recent Wolters Kluwer survey found consumers worry about a lack of transparency in the origins of information being used by GenAI. Most need to know the company behind the GenAI has a long track record in healthcare. (Survey executive summary)\n\nAround 50% of Wolters Kluwerâs digital revenues now come from products that leverage artificial intelligence. Wolters Kluwer products, services and expert solutions are based on a foundation of trust, transparency, and responsibility â\" in line with the companyâs values. Wolters Kluwerâs AI Principles guide the design, development, and deployment of advanced technologies in helping customers solve their most complex problemsâ\"in healthcare and beyond.\n\nAbout Wolters Kluwer\n\nWolters Kluwer (EURONEXT: WKL) is a global leader in information, software, and services for professionals in healthcare, tax and accounting, financial and corporate compliance, legal and regulatory, and corporate performance and ESG.

        "body": "Tahaluf (https://Tahaluf.com), the strategic joint venture between Informa PLC, the Saudi Federation for Cybersecurity, Programming and Drones (SAFCSP), and the Events Investment Fund (EIF), has announced the single biggest events expansion program in Saudi history with plans to launch 20 new sectors-specific trade and consumer events in the Kingdom within 18 months.\n\nThe massive expansion will see Tahaluf debut iconic Informa brands in Saudi Arabia, including CPHI and Cosmoprof, to serve the global pharmaceutical and beauty industries, enhance existing flagship brands, such as the real estate-focused Cityscape Global, and launch new titles and concepts aligned with the strategic objectives of the Kingdom's Vision 2030.\n\nThe expansion will further stretch Tahaluf's lead as the largest Saudi Arabia-based event organiser in terms of square metres and revenue, and one of the largest across the Middle East.\n\n\"Our new events will focus on Vision 2030's strategically important sectors, including technology, real estate, infrastructure, aviation, pharmaceuticals, food, health and beauty, tourism, finance and hospitality,\" said Michael Champion, CEO of Tahaluf and a co-creator of LEAP, the world's fastest-growing technology event. \"This scaling up of our already successful portfolio represents an unprecedented growth curve in the global events industry, and helps realise national ambitions in job creation, new business opportunities, support for economic diversification, and the delivery of tangible economic impact.\"\n\nThe expansion is estimated to generate more than US$1 billion in economic impact in Riyadh through exhibitor and delegate spending on travel and hospitality. The macroeconomic impact will complement Tahaluf's investment in new office spaces in the country's capital and its planned recruitment of up to 200-plus professionals over the coming year, including Saudi nationals.\n\n\"In addition, the events will further position Saudi Arabia as a global player in the staging of live events and expose international businesses to the reality of the Kingdom today as a dynamic and vibrant marketplace open to investment, collaboration, and tourism from all corners of the world,\" added Champion.\n\nSince its launch, one year ago, Tahaluf has made a huge impact on the global events sector delivering record-breaking, award-winning events including LEAP, which, with the support of the Ministry of Communications and Information Technology (MCIT), has become the world's most-attended tech show; the inaugural Cityscape Global last September; the artificial intelligence (AI) event DeepFest; the Saudi Government-backed 'InFlavour' global F&B mega-event; the Global Health Exhibition; and Black Hat MEA, the world's most attended infosec event.\n\nTahaluf's outstanding success has seen the company attract investment from SAFCSP, EIF - a part of the National Development Fund - and will soon include Sela, the PIF-owned event production company, joining Tahaluf's shareholders. The announced expansion will see Tahaluf further stretch its lead as Kingdom's largest exhibition and large-scale conference organiser.\n\n\"With this powerful shareholder base, Tahaluf is now unrivalled in its ability to deliver and create outstanding quality events that turbo-charge transformation across Saudi Arabia's high potential MICE sector,\" said Champion. \"The expanded portfolio will help increase the MICE sector's share of Saudi Arabia's non-oil GDP by bringing global expertise and foreign direct investment into the Kingdom, while creating economic and environmentally sustainable public-private partnerships. Additionally, the development of the MICE ecosystem will propel the tourism sector's annual GDP contribution from its current three per cent to more than 10 per cent by 2030.\"\n\nChampion added the portfolio of planned launches represents strategic industry-specific vehicles for Tahaluf, the events sector, and Saudi Arabia. \"Each new trade event will feature investment enabling formats, including investor and venture capitalist funding platforms, business matchmaking, and start-up pitching programmes. These will bring the latest technical know-how to the Kingdom and catalyse cross-border collaboration, partnerships, and inward investment. High-profile trade events have time and again proven their worth as business generation platforms shortcutting the time-to-market for many ventures looking for a foothold in Saudi Arabia - and the wider region - and our new titles, many of Informa's most valuable IPs from USA, Europe and Asia, will exemplify this business-focussed approach.\"\n\nDistributed by APO Group on behalf of Tahaluf.\n\nAbout Tahaluf:\n\nHeadquartered in Riyadh, Tahaluf brings together strategically important commercial communities from the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the wider Gulf region, and from around the world to a portfolio of world-class exhibitions and digital platforms.\n\nTahaluf is a joint venture partnership between Informa PLC, the world's largest tradeshow organiser, the Saudi Federation for Cybersecurity, Programming and Drones (SAFCSP), and Events Investment Fund (EIF). Sela, the Saudi-owned event production company renowned for its creation of spectacular event experiences, intends to join the joint venture in the near future.\n\nFollowing the highly successful launches of award-winning tech events LEAP, Black Hat Middle East, the artificial intelligence event DeepFest in the Kingdom, Cityscape Global, the Global Health Exhibition and InFlavour, for the food industry, Tahaluf plans to launch further diverse original concept events, for the Infrastructure sector, the VC community, and multiple other sectors including Health, Consumer, Aviation, Consumer and Luxury. Tahaluf will also bring iconic Informa brands to Saudi Arabia, including CPHI and Cosmoprof, serving the global pharmaceutical and beauty industries respectively.

        "body": "The electric vehicle sector is witnessing a positive shift in investor sentiment as Rivian Automotive (RIVN, Financial) heads into 2024 with a stronger production outlook and new customer acquisitions. The company's stock has seen a significant rally, climbing 43% over the last six weeks, and is now up 41% year-to-date. The construction of a new manufacturing facility in Georgia is expected to further bolster Rivian's production capabilities, with a planned annual capacity of 400,000 units. Despite a hold rating from Seeking Alpha's Quant Rating system, the drop in short interest to 15% of the total float suggests a growing confidence among investors.\n\nThe energy sector is gearing up for a significant event as the federal government prepares to auction oil and gas leases in the Gulf of Mexico. This auction, potentially the last opportunity for energy companies to bid on regional acreage until 2025, includes over 72.7 million acres. Energy giants like Exxon and Chevron are likely to be closely watched as the auction unfolds, with implications for the traditional energy markets and companies like Devon Energy, which has embraced a variable dividend strategy.\n\nWells Fargo has released its 2024 outlook for the software industry, highlighting a stabilizing macro environment and potential growth opportunities. Microsoft (MSFT, Financial) emerges as the top pick, with expectations of increased budget allocations from CIOs. The focus on data and artificial intelligence is also expected to benefit companies like Snowflake (SNOW, Financial) and Braze (BRZE, Financial), positioning them as top performers in the coming year.\n\nEsports Entertainment Group (GMBL, Financial) has announced a drastic 1-for-400 reverse stock split, aiming to reduce the number of outstanding shares and potentially stabilize its stock price. This move reflects the company's strategic adjustments and could have implications for its financial stability and investor appeal.\n\nGeneral Mills (GIS, Financial) reported a revenue miss for FQ2 2024 and has subsequently lowered its full-year organic sales growth guidance. The company's stock slipped in pre-market trading as it faces challenges in demand recovery and consumer spending. This development could signal broader trends in the consumer goods sector and impact investor sentiment towards similar companies.\n\nThe stock market saw a mix of significant gainers and losers, with companies like Polished (POL, Financial) and Applied UV (AUVI, Financial) experiencing substantial gains, while Bluebird Bio (BLUE, Financial) suffered a steep decline following a stock offering. These movements reflect the dynamic nature of the market and the varying factors influencing individual stock performances.\n\nDXC Technology (DXC, Financial) has undergone a leadership change with Raul Fernandez stepping in as interim President and CEO. This transition could signal a new strategic direction for the company and impact its market position and investor relations.\n\nParamount (PARA, Financial) (PARAA) shares saw a slight increase after Wells Fargo upgraded the media giant, speculating on the potential for asset sales and strategic deals. This reflects the ongoing changes in the media landscape and the strategic considerations of major players in the industry.\n\nByteDance (BDNCE, Financial) has reported impressive sales growth, potentially surpassing Tencent (TCEHY) (TCTZF) and highlighting the competitive dynamics in the tech and social media sectors. The company's success, despite economic uncertainties and regulatory challenges, underscores the strength of its product offerings and market strategy.\n\nNvidia (NVDA, Financial) saw insider trading activity with director Dawn Hudson selling shares, providing insights into executive confidence and potential future stock movements. This information could be of interest to investors monitoring insider trading patterns and company valuation.\n\nCinemark Holdings (CNK, Financial) experienced a downgrade due to a negative box office outlook, reflecting broader industry challenges and the impact of delayed film releases on theater chains. This development could influence investor sentiment towards the entertainment sector and related stocks.\n\nWEC Energy (WEC, Financial) has announced a dividend increase, signaling financial strength and commitment to shareholder returns. This move could attract income-focused investors and impact the utility sector's attractiveness.",

        "body": "Law students will gain access to LexisNexis' generative artificial intelligence platform\n\nLexisNexis announced Wednesday that Lexis+ AI, its generative artificial intelligence platform, will become available to 100,000 second- and third-year law and master of laws students at ABA-accredited law schools during the upcoming spring semester.\n\nThe rollout follows a test run in the fall during which 450 law school librarians, legal research and writing instructors and legal technology professors were given access to the platform, which supports conversational search, intelligent legal drafting, insightful summarization and document analysis.\n\n\"It's a win-win that helps the next generation of lawyers prepare to practice by honing their skills using Lexis+ AI,\" said Sean Fitzpatrick, the CEO of LexisNexis North America, the U.K. and Ireland, in a statement. \"At the same time, law school faculty and student feedback is critically important to the continued development of the solution.\"\n\nThe New York-based company is gathering feedback that will guide the application's refinement as it becomes available in classrooms, according to a Dec. 20 press release.\n\n\"This is a big development,\" says Daniel W. Linna Jr., a senior lecturer and the director of law and technology initiatives at the Northwestern University Pritzker School of Law. \"Law firms are using these tools, experimenting them for a while, and students need to start learning how to use them.\"\n\nFaculty training webinars will be scheduled in the coming weeks, according to the press release.\n\nAnswers to prompts in Lexis+ AI are pulled from LexisNexis' large repository of legal content, and the platform uses industry-leading data security and attention to privacy, according to the press release.\n\nA March security breach with OpenAI's ChatGPT created privacy concerns, and that platform's tendency to sometimes offer information with no factual basis caused some to be hesitant about using generative AI.\n\nThe Lexis+ AI website underscores that it has \"linked hallucination-free legal citations.\"\n\nSince the arrival of ChatGPT made a splash in late 2022, there's been debate among law school faculty about ethically using generative AI.\n\nHowever, a survey of more than 450 law school librarians, legal research and writing and legal technology professors conducted by LexisNexis found that 78% of law school faculty have plans to teach students about generative AI tools this spring, according to the press release.\n\nThe platform has \"exciting potential,\" according to Kristina Chamorro, an instructional and educational technology librarian at the University of California at Berkeley School of Law involved with the fall pilot program, in an email to the ABA Journal.\n\nShe adds that teaching best practices will be key.\n\n\"A concern I have with all gen AI legal research tools, including Lexis+ AI, is that students won't immediately understand how to incorporate these tools with traditional legal research methods,\" Chamorro wrote. \"They will also need guidance on a range of risks, including the possibility of AI-generated output oversimplifying complex legal concepts or missing relevant authority, as well as on confidentiality concerns and ethical issues.\"\n\n\"Faculty need to figure out how to encourage students use these tools,\" Linna adds. \"Pedagogy needs to change.\"\n\nHe questioned why only 2Ls and 3Ls will have access Lexis+ AI.\n\n\"If I was a first-year law student, I'd want to get access to this tool, so I'm prepared to do whatever I'm going to do in that first summer after my first year of law school,\" Linna says.",

        "body": "$HHSE BLOG: Good Business Math: How to turn $4-mm in Private Investment & Presales into a $100-MM Revenue Stream\n\nFriday, September 15, 2023\n\n(Click on link to view photos)\n\nhttp://hannoverhousemovies.blogspot.com/2023/09/good-business-math-how-to-turn-4-mm-in.html\n\nGreetings HHSE Friends & Followers - We cannot stress how material and monumental the news of today is: that we are going to be the FIRST production company to make a fully CGI - Artifical Intelligence generated animated feature with JOURNEY TO UTOPIA.\n\nFor decades, Disney, Pixar, Fox and Universal / Amblin have controlled the $400+BILLION annual world animation market - due to the obstacles of the HUGE production costs and multi-year schedules that animated features have traditionally required. That all goes away with the advent of Ultra-HD quality AI generated animation, following top-shelf character designs, scene structures and built atop a solid script with Academy Award level voice actors.\n\nSuddenly, a (currently) small company like Hannover House (and our new INTELIMATION AI division) can produce a film that looks and feels comparable to the top studio releases.\n\nBut we can do it for $4-million and finish it in less than 8-months. Best of all, the production costs are fully covered by production incentives, bank gap credit and private investors... so HHSE does not have to struggle to find capital or dilute the company's share structure with stock issuances.\n\nThis is a seminal moment in the company, and one that will be further enhanced by our uplist filings and the MyFlix division.\n\nGet ready, friends. It's going to be an exciting ride!\n\nHannover House forms InteliMation AI for first major A.I. Animated Feature Production\n\nJOURNEY TO UTOPIA to begin production in December with A-List Voice & Music Talent\n\nMajor launch planned for Cannes and Summer (2024) Theatrical Release\n\nNew York, NY - InteliMation AI, a newly formed division of indie studio Hannover House, Inc. (OTC: HHSE), has secured a private investment commitment to produce the world's first fully A.I. and CGI generated feature film, the family appeal fantasy film, \"Journey to Utopia.\" Featuring a voice talent cast of Academy Award winning actors and box office stars, the film's visuals will be fully generated using cutting-edge Artificial Intelligence visual rendering, based on producer-supplied scene structure input and character designs.\n\n\"We have been trying to produce this film for the past ten years,\" said Eric Parkinson, C.E.O. of Hannover House. \"But the visual demands of creating the land of Utopia made the production costs prohibitive and financially risky. That has changed now with the new A.I. technology and our improved strategy to make the film animated as opposed to live-action,\" he concluded.\n\n\"The Artificial Intelligence CGI technology has reached a point where we can create an animated feature that is visually comparable to a $200-million-dollar studio production, but completed for a fraction of the cost and time,\" said Parkinson. \"From script to theatrical DCP, we can produce a major studio quality animated feature in less than eight months.\"\n\n\"The technology from InteliMation should herald in a major paradigm shift in entertainment,\" said Christian Large, an independent producer and advisor to Hannover House. \"High-end animated features will no longer take multiple years and hundreds-of-millions of dollars to produce. This technological breakthrough will enable a broader range of stories to be created and released, which ultimately will help expand the market,\" he concluded.\n\nThe script for \"JOURNEY TO UTOPIA\" was written by Mike Snyder (\"Wildfire\") based on a story by Eric Parkinson. The production is in negotiations to secure three Academy Award winning actors as voice talent for the film. Shirley MacLaine is pegged for the role of \"Mother Goose;\" Forest Whitaker is being pursued to portray the principal antagonist, \"Valkerna,\" and Kim Basinger is being pursued in the role of \"Connie Hammonds,\" the mother of one of the kids who becomes trapped in the land of Utopia.\n\nPending receipt of a Screen Actors Guild waiver for the production, recording of voice talent is expected to start in late November. A promo reel is planned for the Cannes 2024 festival with a USA Theatrical launch targeted for July 2024.\n\nThe world animation market will generate over $411-billion dollars in 2023, according to Statista Research Department - and is expected to grow to over $580-billion by the year 2030. The A.I. fueled software technology pioneered by Hannover House and InteliMation will revolutionize how animated features and television programming are made.\n\nHannover House and InteliMation are targeting to complete two animated features in 2024, with three set for 2025 and four features per year beginning in 2026. Hannover House will handle the sales representation of the films worldwide, and will coordinate North American theatrical and ancillary sales campaigns with exhibitors, partner studios and major video-on-demand platforms. Hannover House was formed in 1993 and has found success in a variety of indie film distribution arenas, from DVD and VOD distribution to theatrical exhibition.\n\nThe release plans for \"Journey To Utopia\" will follow a traditional model of a wide USA theatrical launch, followed by Video-On-Demand and physical goods (DVDs / BluRay units).\n\nAbout Eric Parkinson and Hannover House\n\nEric Parkinson is an indie film distribution veteran of over thirty-five years, best known for his long reigns as CEO of both Hannover House, Inc. and Hemdale Communications. Parkinson has been directly involved with the release of more than 1,500 feature titles, including notable release campaigns for commercial hits including \"Terminator,\" \"Highlander 2\" and Best Picture Oscar winners \"Platoon\" and \"The Last Emperor.\" Animated features distributed by Parkinson include three #1 Billboard Magazine Top Selling hits, \"Little Nemo: Adventures in Slumberland\", \"The Magic Voyage\" and \"The Princess and the Goblin.\" On the production side, Parkinson has over fifty feature film credits as a Producer or Executive Producer, and just completed his directorial debut with \"WILDFIRE: The Legend of the Cherokee Ghost Horse,\" starring Anne Heche in her final feature release. Hannover House was formed in 1993 as a book publisher, but grew into a top ten Walmart DVD supplier by the mid '2000's with dozens of indie releases populating the popular DVD Budget Bins nationwide. The company expanded into theatrical releases, which were a transitional business model to service the growing Video-On-Demand market. Hannover House stopped representing third-party / indie films in 2018 in favor of a business model that focuses resources on the creation of original, high-profile feature productions.",

        "title": "The Ultimate Growth Stocks to Buy With $1,000 Right Now | The Motley Fool",
        "body": "These two companies have given investors solid returns in 2023, and they look ready to do the same again.\n\nThe stock market has rallied impressively in 2023 thanks to multiple factors such as cooling inflation, the Federal Reserve's pause on interest rate hikes, a robust U.S. economy, and a solid job market, all of which explains why the Nasdaq Composite index has shot up an impressive 41% this year.\n\nThe good news is that the stock market is expected to head higher in 2024, especially as the Fed is anticipated to cut interest rates three times next year. Bloomberg, for instance, forecasts that the S&P 500 index could hit record highs in 2024. A lower interest rate environment bodes well for growth stocks, which struggled last year when the Fed was continuously increasing rates.\n\nLower interest rates will allow growth-oriented companies to get access to capital at a lower cost, while also increasing the value of their future cash flows. That's why if you have $1,000 in investible cash after paying off your bills, clearing any high-interest debt, and saving enough for difficult times, it could be a good idea to put that money into the following growth stocks that could deliver healthy returns in 2024 and beyond.\n\nWhat's worth noting here is that Nvidia stock is cheaper on a forward earnings basis compared to some of its peers in the \"Magnificent Seven,\" which refers to a group of seven megacap tech companies that have been delivering significant gains recently.\n\nInvestors, therefore, can still consider buying Nvidia even though it has more than tripled this year. That's because the company's dominance of the market for artificial intelligence (AI) chips is likely to drive even stronger growth next year.\n\nNvidia is on track to end the current fiscal year with revenue of $59 billion, which would be a 119% jump over the prior year. The company's data center business has played a critical role in this impressive growth, as this segment has benefited from the AI chip boom. More specifically, 75% of the company's revenue has come from selling data center chips in the first nine months of the current fiscal year.\n\nSo, the data center business could end the year with $44 billion in revenue (based on the contribution of the data center business to Nvidia's top line and its full-year revenue forecast), which would be nearly triple the revenue it generated in fiscal 2023.\n\nNvidia's rival Advanced Micro Devices estimates that the AI chip market could be worth $45 billion this year. This means that Nvidia now has a terrific grip on this market. What's more, AMD estimates that the AI chip market could be worth a whopping $400 billion in 2027, multiplying almost 10 times within five years. Even if Nvidia loses share and ends up controlling half of this market at that time, its top line could hit $200 billion. That would be more than three times Nvidia's estimated fiscal 2024 revenue.\n\nNot surprisingly, analysts are expecting Nvidia's earnings growth to accelerate significantly over the next five years to an annual rate of 103% as compared to the 48% annual growth it has clocked in the past five years. As such, Nvidia seems capable of giving investors hefty returns in the future as well, which is why putting $1,000 into this tech stock seems like a good idea right now.\n\nA $1,000 investment in Micron Technology (MU 0.75%) stock at the beginning of the year is now worth just over $1,600. Shares of the memory specialist have benefited from the changing dynamics in the memory market, which has been under duress over the past couple of years on account of an oversupply.\n\nMarket research firm TrendForce estimates that the price of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) increased 18% quarter over quarter in the third quarter of 2023. The firm predicts that prices could jump another 13% to 18% in the current quarter. More importantly, Gartner is forecasting a massive increase of 66% in the memory market's revenue next year, which would be a big improvement over 2023's estimated decline of 39%.\n\nThere are multiple reasons the memory market is expected to turn around sharply next year. First, sales of personal computers are expected to recover 8% in 2024, following an estimated decline of 12.4% this year. Second, the smartphone market is also expected to rebound next year. And finally, new catalysts such as AI are going to drive an improvement in memory demand, and the good part is that Micron is well-placed to take advantage of the same.\n\nTherefore, consensus estimates are pointing toward a significant acceleration in Micron's growth. The company is expected to deliver a 40% jump in revenue in the current fiscal year (which started in September 2023) to $21.8 billion, while its loss is expected to shrink to $1.21 per share from a loss of $4.45 per share in fiscal 2023. Even better, Micron is expected to sustain solid growth in the next fiscal year.\n\nGiven that Micron stock is currently trading at 5.7 times sales, investors are getting a good deal on it, considering the impressive growth that it is set to deliver. If Micron does hit $31 billion in revenue in a couple of years, as the estimates suggest and maintains its current sales multiple, its market cap could increase to $176 billion. That would be a 95% increase from current levels, indicating that a $1,000 investment in this semiconductor stock may double over the next two years.",

        "body": "You're reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool's Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More\n\nEither Cloudflare (NET 0.96%) possesses good timing or perhaps it's blessed with prescience. The provider of cloud-based services debuted on Wall Street in 2019 at $15 per share when cloud computing was rising in popularity. Mere months later the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and due to society's sudden need for cloud-based internet solutions to to take classes or work remotely, Cloudflare stock rocketed past $200 per share.\n\nIts stock returned to earth since then. But on Dec. 15, Cloudflare shares reached a 52-week high after Fortune magazine listed the company among the top 10 businesses with long-term growth potential.\n\nAt this point, does it make sense to buy Cloudflare shares? Digging into the company in more detail can help to determine if now is a good time to invest.\n\nCloudflare tackles the complex task of helping organizations maintain a digital presence. It does this by offering several cloud-based services centered around digital content delivery across an internet network that's fast, safe, and robust at a reasonable cost.\n\nEvery time you visit a website, your device retrieves it from a server in a data center, and the site must load quickly or you may not stick around. Cloudflare delivers speed through a network of data centers spanning over 100 countries around the globe.\n\nStill, a robust network isn't useful unless it's safe and secure from hackers. So cybersecurity is also one of Cloudflare's offerings. Its network security was able to withstand a massive cyberattack generating the equivalent of all the internet traffic in the world.\n\nCloudflare's convergence of a cloud computing network and cybersecurity, referred to as a secure access service edge (SASE), proved another prescient move. SASE is expanding rapidly as more organizations transition to cloud computing.\n\nThe SASE market grew 30% in 2023 to $9 billion according to research firm Gartner, and is expected to reach $25 billion by 2027. Cloudflare's all-in-one SASE solution is already benefiting from this industry tailwind as demonstrated by the company's customer growth.\n\nAt the end of last year, Cloudflare reported more than 160,000 paying customers, nearly double the number it had after its 2019 initial public offering. Customers include U.S. government agencies shedding multiple vendors in favor of Cloudflare's all-in-one offering.\n\nThis customer growth translated into rapidly expanding revenue. In the third quarter, Cloudflare generated sales of $335.6 million, a 32% year-over-year increase.\n\nIts strong Q3 results were the latest in a multiyear trend of rising revenue.\n\nThe company's sales growth is expected to continue. For the fourth quarter, Cloudflare is forecasting double-digit year-over-year revenue growth of at least $352 million, up from 2022's $274.7 million.\n\nThe company's free cash flow (FCF) is also strengthening. FCF provides insight into the cash available for Cloudflare to invest in its business, pay debt obligations, and repurchase shares. Its Q3 FCF was $34.9 million compared to negative FCF of $4.6 million in the prior year.\n\nYet despite Cloudflare's successes, the company isn't profitable. Cloudflare exited Q3 with a net loss of $23.5 million. Because of its strong revenue growth, however, Cloudflare's lack of profitability isn't a concern at this time.\n\nIn fact, many tech companies operate for years without a profit as they prioritize growing their businesses. And a positive sign is that Cloudflare's Q3 net loss improved over the prior year's loss of 42.5 million.\n\nAnd now, there's the advent of artificial intelligence. Cloudflare's prescient gifts came into play once more since, years ago, the company prepared its data centers to support AI's hardware needs. That foresight is proving beneficial.\n\nCloudflare's network can handle the complex tasks executed by AI systems. As a result, the company already has customers wanting to put billions of AI tasks onto Cloudflare's network. The company believes this customer demand will continue to increase, and Cloudflare's foresight preparing for AI gives it a competitive advantage.\n\nCloudflare also benefits from the tailwind of growth across multiple industries. The cloud computing market is expected to increase from $678 billion in 2023 to $2.4 trillion by 2030, which also boosts SASE's market expansion. In addition, the AI market is forecast to grow from $142.3 billion in 2022 to $1.8 trillion by 2030.\n\nWith growth in these industries and its strong IT infrastructure, Cloudflare is positioned to continue its success into 2024, making the stock a buy. Because Cloudflare shares hover near a 52-week high, it's worth taking a small stake now, then using dollar-cost averaging to add to your position later should the price dip.",

        "body": "As artificial intelligence (AI) continues its rapid growth throughout industries and culture, educators and leaders in AI gathered at the Friday Institute for Educational Innovation, part of the College of Education at North Carolina State University, on Nov. 15 for its AI in K-12 Convening to discuss the implementations and potentials of AI in classrooms.\n\n\"The things that we are able to do now because of AI is amazing,\" said Amanda Moore, district innovation coach for Center Grove Community School. \"And if we can help our students and our teachers envision the things that are possible and use those ideas in classrooms now, just imagine what our classrooms could look like.\"\n\nAI relates to technology that can learn and perform intelligent tasks such as data analysis, machine learning, problem solving, and more.

        "body": "Essentially all (99% of) marketers have changed their digital customer experience (CX) strategy over the past 18 months, according to a report [download page] from Acquia, and with content a key part of digital CX, 83% say their organization is under pressure to deliver marketing content differently to ensure they stand out when representing their offerings to customers and prospects.\n\nThis focus on digital CX has been a theme this year: research has declared that \"a disappointing CX is a business risk in 2023,\" and marketing leaders agree that excellence in digital CX is critical to business survival.\n\nThe respondents to this latest survey - marketers across the US, UK and Australia - noted that the biggest factor affecting digital CX over the past 18 months has been the ability to gather enough data about consumer preferences to create productive digital experiences. More than one-third (35%) indicated that this has been the most important factor, ahead of the 24% share who pointed to the ability to create enough content that is sufficiently personalized for customers.\n\nThe capacity to gather consumer data and derive insights from it depends in part on the right tools and technologies, and there are some encouraging developments on this end. Namely, an impressive 98% of respondents report that their organization's ROI for martech tools has improved this year. That's a positive sign amid rumbles of discontent and questions about martech ROI that have recently surfaced.\n\nInterestingly, when asked which technologies are having the biggest positive impact on customer experience, the marketers surveyed cited artificial intelligence (AI) for content creation (generative AI such as ChatGPT) first (45%). As a result, almost half plan to invest in AI for content creation next year, though the vast majority say they're concerned about the potential impact on privacy or security of using AI in marketing, a common theme when discussing this topic.\n\nNonetheless, there's obvious enthusiasm around the use of AI, with 96% saying that their organization's ROI on AI technology is high, 97% expressing optimism about the potential for creativity gains, and 96% likewise optimistic about the potential for efficiency gains.\n\nMeanwhile, other technologies that respondents cite as having a positive impact on the customer experience include content management systems, customer relationship management, and marketing resource management.\n\nThere is still for room for improvement, though: two-thirds (66%) of respondents in the US (and even greater shares in the UK and Australia) say that their organization's marketing technology holds them back from being innovative to either a great extent (33%) or to some extent (33%).",

        "body": "New York, United States, Dec. 20, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- A sleeping mattress is a cushioned object that may be used as a bed and is packed with sleeping-related materials. For diverse client needs, various materials are offered as sleeping beds, including foam, latex, innerspring, and hybrid mattresses. The companies continue to create cutting-edge technology, such as contactless sleep trackers and mattress cooling software, to remain relevant in the competitive market. With increasing discretionary income and a surge in wealthy individuals, luxury items are expected to acquire substantial traction in the upcoming years, driving growth. Mattresses are a better indicator of a person's quality of life than almost any other consumer durable.\n\nDownload Free Sample Report PDF @ https://straitsresearch.com/report/sleeping-mattress-market/request-sample\n\nGrowing Urbanization and Rapid Expansion of Hospitality Industry Drives the Global Market\n\nAccording to UNCTAD, the rate of urbanization worldwide is 55.7%. With the population growing exponentially, there is also a growing need for sleeping beds. Thus, rapid urbanization and population increase benefit the residential and commercial sectors and raise the demand for mattresses for sleeping. The hospitality industry provides its customers with the best sleeping and comfort options. As a result, the hospitality industry is experiencing an increased demand for more unique and comfortable mattresses. Urbanization has also increased the number of interior design and home renovation projects in developed and metropolitan areas, which has helped the industry.\n\nHealth Monitoring through Sleeping Mattress Creates Tremendous Opportunities\n\nAccording to Straits Research, \"The global sleeping mattress market size was valued at USD 27,419 million in 2021. It is projected to reach USD 43,270.3 million by 2030, growing at a CAGR of 5.2% during the forecast period (2022-2030).\" Due to bad sleep habits and health issues, the prevalence of sleeping disorders is dangerously increasing globally. Artificial intelligence is also incorporated into the mattress to keep track of users' health while they sleep and adjust the temperature accordingly. In the near future, it is projected that this technology will change the global mattress business. Magnifies, an Italian mattress manufacturer, also plans to release MagniSmartech, a similar device, in the following year. This revolutionary high-tech system integrates the mattress, bed frame, and bed. It uses sensor-based technology to collect data on the people in the room and the physical environment.\n\nRegional Analysis\n\nNorth America is the most significant shareholder in the global sleeping mattress market and is expected to grow at a CAGR of 3.8% during the forecast period. Operating businesses in the sector are updating their client groups, developing product portfolios, implementing omnichannel strategies, repositioning their brands, and putting new service models into place. According to internal estimates, more than 50 million Americans of various ages and socioeconomic status struggle with sleep issues. The market is expected to grow moderately over the forecast period because sleep-related problems are so common in the region.\n\nAsia-Pacific is expected to grow at a CAGR of 6.9% during the forecast period. The market has significant growth potential since Asia-Pacific companies offer new and cutting-edge creative bedding solutions that appeal to an extensive consumer base. Given the expanding urbanization and digitalization of the area, the development of modern retail channels is expected to offer exciting opportunities to concerned parties. Additionally, it is anticipated that rising consumer awareness of the importance of sleep will propel the development of this market in the region.\n\nThe raw materials used in mattresses, the testing procedures, and the chemical components are all subject to tight regulations in European countries. However, the demand for sleeping mattresses in the bedding products market is projected to proliferate. Europe places a significant emphasis on the capability of recycling mattresses in its highly developed economy. Partnerships between producers and suppliers of raw materials are expanding to lessen the danger of landfill pollution. Recycled polyols are produced from used mattresses due to a collaboration between Dow Polyurethanes and German machinery manufacturer H&S Anlagentechnik. Furthermore, beds made of organic materials like jute, cotton, wool, and coconut fibers are becoming more and more well-liked in the region.\n\nThe global sleeping mattress market's major key players are Kingsdown, Kurl-On Enterprise Ltd, Leggett & Platt Incorporated, Paramount Bed Holdings Co. Ltd, Saatva, Serta Simmons, Silentnight Group, Sleep Number Corporation, Spring Air, Tempur Sealy International, Inc\n\nGet Detailed Market Segmentation @ https://straitsresearch.com/report/sleeping-mattress-market/segmentation\n\nAbout Straits Research Pvt.

        "title": "The Ultimate Growth Stocks to Buy With $1,000 Right Now",
        "body": "The stock market has rallied impressively in 2023 thanks to multiple factors such as cooling inflation, the Federal Reserve's pause on interest rate hikes, a robust U.S. economy, and a solid job market, all of which explains why the Nasdaq Composite index has shot up an impressive 41% this year.\n\nThe good news is that the stock market is expected to head higher in 2024, especially as the Fed is anticipated to cut interest rates three times next year. Bloomberg, for instance, forecasts that the S&P 500 index could hit record highs in 2024. A lower interest rate environment bodes well for growth stocks, which struggled last year when the Fed was continuously increasing rates.\n\nLower interest rates will allow growth-oriented companies to get access to capital at a lower cost, while also increasing the value of their future cash flows. That's why if you have $1,000 in investible cash after paying off your bills, clearing any high-interest debt, and saving enough for difficult times, it could be a good idea to put that money into the following growth stocks that could deliver healthy returns in 2024 and beyond.\n\nNvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) has become a top growth play in 2023, turning a $1,000 investment made in the stock at the beginning of the year into more than $3,300 as of this writing.\n\nWhat's worth noting here is that Nvidia stock is cheaper on a forward earnings basis compared to some of its peers in the \"Magnificent Seven,\" which refers to a group of seven megacap tech companies that have been delivering significant gains recently.\n\nMelius Research analyst Ben Reitzes, who has a $750 price target on Nvidia stock, points out that the tech giant is cheaper than Apple and Microsoft as far as the forward price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio is concerned. As the following chart shows, only Meta Platforms and Alphabet are cheaper than Nvidia on a forward P/E basis.\n\nInvestors, therefore, can still consider buying Nvidia even though it has more than tripled this year. That's because the company's dominance of the market for artificial intelligence (AI) chips is likely to drive even stronger growth next year.\n\nNvidia is on track to end the current fiscal year with revenue of $59 billion, which would be a 119% jump over the prior year. The company's data center business has played a critical role in this impressive growth, as this segment has benefited from the AI chip boom. More specifically, 75% of the company's revenue has come from selling data center chips in the first nine months of the current fiscal year.\n\nSo, the data center business could end the year with $44 billion in revenue (based on the contribution of the data center business to Nvidia's top line and its full-year revenue forecast), which would be nearly triple the revenue it generated in fiscal 2023.\n\nNvidia's rival Advanced Micro Devices estimates that the AI chip market could be worth $45 billion this year. This means that Nvidia now has a terrific grip on this market. What's more, AMD estimates that the AI chip market could be worth a whopping $400 billion in 2027, multiplying almost 10 times within five years. Even if Nvidia loses share and ends up controlling half of this market at that time, its top line could hit $200 billion. That would be more than three times Nvidia's estimated fiscal 2024 revenue.\n\nNot surprisingly, analysts are expecting Nvidia's earnings growth to accelerate significantly over the next five years to an annual rate of 103% as compared to the 48% annual growth it has clocked in the past five years. As such, Nvidia seems capable of giving investors hefty returns in the future as well, which is why putting $1,000 into this tech stock seems like a good idea right now.\n\nA $1,000 investment in Micron Technology (NASDAQ: MU) stock at the beginning of the year is now worth just over $1,600. Shares of the memory specialist have benefited from the changing dynamics in the memory market, which has been under duress over the past couple of years on account of an oversupply.\n\nMarket research firm TrendForce estimates that the price of dynamic random access memory (DRAM) increased 18% quarter over quarter in the third quarter of 2023. The firm predicts that prices could jump another 13% to 18% in the current quarter. More importantly, Gartner is forecasting a massive increase of 66% in the memory market's revenue next year, which would be a big improvement over 2023's estimated decline of 39%.\n\nThere are multiple reasons the memory market is expected to turn around sharply next year. First, sales of personal computers are expected to recover 8% in 2024, following an estimated decline of 12.4% this year. Second, the smartphone market is also expected to rebound next year. And finally, new catalysts such as AI are going to drive an improvement in memory demand, and the good part is that Micron is well-placed to take advantage of the same.\n\nTherefore, consensus estimates are pointing toward a significant acceleration in Micron's growth. The company is expected to deliver a 40% jump in revenue in the current fiscal year (which started in September 2023) to $21.8 billion, while its loss is expected to shrink to $1.21 per share from a loss of $4.45 per share in fiscal 2023. Even better, Micron is expected to sustain solid growth in the next fiscal year.\n\nGiven that Micron stock is currently trading at 5.7 times sales, investors are getting a good deal on it, considering the impressive growth that it is set to deliver. If Micron does hit $31 billion in revenue in a couple of years, as the estimates suggest and maintains its current sales multiple, its market cap could increase to $176 billion. That would be a 95% increase from current levels, indicating that a $1,000 investment in this semiconductor stock may double over the next two years.\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has more than tripled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "body": "New Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy speaks at the Dec. 18 event in Chancellor Green announcing plans for the AI innovation hub. He said it will be \"a new home for the world's boldest and brightest to pioneer breakthroughs for the betterment of humankind.\"\n\nNew Jersey Gov. Phil Murphy joined University President Christopher L. Eisgruber on Monday to announce plans to create an artificial intelligence innovation hub for the state, in collaboration with the New Jersey Economic Development Authority.\n\n\"With today's announcement, New Jersey -- alongside Princeton University -- is poised to shape the future of this revolutionary field and unleash a new century of game-changing discovery,\" Murphy said, describing the planned AI hub as \"a new home for the world's boldest and brightest to pioneer breakthroughs for the betterment of humankind.\"\n\nSaid Eisgruber: \"Together we will leverage Princeton's leadership in AI and the strengths of the central New Jersey region to establish an integrated hub of AI activity.\"\n\nState and University officials gathered for the announcement in Princeton's historic Chancellor Green rotunda, joined by representatives from the AI industry, New Jersey's higher education and business communities, and local government.\n\nOfficials said the initiative will bring together AI researchers, industry leaders, start-up companies, and other collaborators to advance research and development, house dedicated accelerator space, advance the use of ethical AI for positive societal impact, and promote workforce development to support new technology development, in collaboration with other New Jersey universities, community colleges, and vocational schools.\n\n\"With this hub, we have the potential to pioneer technologies that could unlock new cures for debilitating diseases, or new solutions for combating climate change, or new methods for educating our students so that every child can receive the personalized attention they deserve and need to reach their full potential,\" Murphy said. \"With AI, we have a chance to confront -- and perhaps overcome -- some of the greatest challenges facing our world.\"\n\nIn his remarks, Eisgruber spoke to the collaborative promise of the new initiative, which he said will build on the University's \"strong partnerships with and proximity to many of New Jersey's other leading higher education institutions,\" including Rutgers University, and \"will bring together AI researchers, industry leaders, start-up companies and other collaborators to foster AI innovation in central New Jersey.\"\n\nThe planned AI hub fits into Princeton's vision for the coming years, the president said. \"Princeton's strategic framework recognizes the promise and societal implications of artificial intelligence -- as well as the University's unique capacity to meet these challenges,\" he said. \"Working to establish this hub for AI will further our efforts in this important area, while strengthening the regional ecosystem of innovation and advancing Princeton's broader teaching and research mission.\"\n\nEisgruber continued, \"We look forward to continuing to collaborate with our local communities, our higher education partners, and of course the great state of New Jersey as we pursue further innovations and discovery in AI and work to establish this hub.\"\n\nHe also announced that Princeton and the state will co-host an AI conference on April 11 to convene \"leaders from academia, industry, and government to discuss the most pressing AI issues of the day.\"\n\nState leaders have worked closely to formulate the scale and shape of the hub with University Provost Jennifer Rexford, Vice President and Secretary Hilary Parker, Dean of the School of Engineering and Applied Science Andrea Goldsmith, Vice Dean for Innovation Craig Arnold, and Assistant Vice President for State Affairs David Reiner.\n\nRexford outlined what makes the University uniquely positioned to support and expand New Jersey's AI innovation ecosystem.\n\n\"Here at Princeton, we're really fortunate to have three main strengths that are allowing us to tackle important challenges in this area,\" said Rexford, who is Princeton's Gordon Y.S. Wu Professor in Engineering, a member of Princeton's Class of 1991, and a computer scientist.\n\n\"The first is our foundational strengths,\" she said. \"Our researchers are focusing on how to make AI methods more accurate, more efficient, more explainable -- better in every way.\"\n\nPrinceton's second strength, Rexford said, is its commitment to interdisciplinary research. \"Our colleagues are applying AI to disciplinary data in fields all over campus, using them to advance and accelerate discovery in a wide range of fields.\"\n\nThe third strength that she highlighted is Princeton's commitment to service. She cited the University's informal motto: \"in the nation's service and the service of humanity.\"\n\n\"Our researchers are using AI to tackle societal challenges in new ways that were not possible before and also grappling with new challenges that AI itself is introducing,\" she said.\n\nAmong the University's initiatives, as Eisgruber noted in his remarks, are the Center for Information Technology Policy, which brings together policy experts, engineers and academic researchers; Princeton Precision Health, which uses artificial intelligence to inform medical care; and the Princeton Language and Intelligence initiative, which explores how large language models will affect society.\n\nThe other speakers at the hub announcement were Tim Sullivan, chief executive officer of the New Jersey Economic Development Authority, and Beth Noveck, the chief innovation officer for the state.\n\n\"Today is a pretty bold and historic declaration that New Jersey intends to lead the pack,\" said Sullivan. \"New Jersey and Princeton intend to lead the charge in doing this right.\"\n\nNoveck underscored Princeton's long history of computing innovation, including the contributions of Alan Turing and John von Neumann.",

Also part of the deal, IMPULSE gets to name a director to Substrate's supervisory board.\n\nGarcía explains that IMPULSE is Substrate's first institutional investor and says its a \"great opportunity\" for the company and hopefully the first of many.\n\nReflecting on a 2023 that he describes as a \"great year\" for Substrate, Serratosa highlights the company's solid growth, with a 150% increase in revenues to €6.5mln. This achievement is particularly notable given the company's status as a relatively small player in the AI industry, especially within the Spanish market.\n\nSubstrate AI's aggressive expansion strategy included acquiring four companies, further diversifying its portfolio and solidifying its presence in the European AI sector.\n\nLooking ahead to 2024, the company aims to continue its growth trajectory, targeting a 100% revenue increase to an estimated €13mln. This ambitious goal is supported by a focus on micro M&A and exploring new opportunities to enhance its competitive edge in AI.",

        "body": "Active customers in Canada include Bell Canada, BlackBerry, Calgary Sports and Entertainment, CI Financial, Keyera, Kidoodle.tv, KOHO Financial, Maple Leaf Sports & Entertainment (MLSE), the National Hockey League (NHL), Natural Resources Canada (NRCan), Neo Financial, Nutrien, RBC, SECURE, Sun Life, TELUS, University of Calgary, and many others innovating on AWS.\n\nAmazon Web Services (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company announced the launch of its second AWS infrastructure Region in Canada -- the AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region. Starting .developers, startups, entrepreneurs, and enterprises, as well as government, education, and nonprofit organizations, will have greater choice for running their applications and serving end users from AWS data centers located in Canada. Customers will also have access to advanced AWS technologies, including data analytics, security, machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI), to drive innovation. AWS also released a new economic impact study highlighting that the company is planning to invest an estimated $17.9 billion (approximately CA $24.8 billion) in Canada through 2037 via the new AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region and the existing AWS Canada (Central) Region in Quebec. For more information about AWS Global Infrastructure,\n\n\"With the launch of a second AWS Region in Canada, this provides us more flexibility, reliability, and security to unlock more opportunities to engage our fans across Canada and the world to better understand and enjoy the game.\"\n\n\"With the launch of the AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region, customers and partners across Canada now have additional infrastructure to deploy applications with greater resilience, availability, and lower latency, while enabling more customers to innovate with advanced technologies like artificial intelligence to help fuel economic development across the country,\" said Prasad Kalyanaraman, vice president of Infrastructure Services at AWS. \"AWS is committed to helping organizations of all sizes and across all industries increase agility and drive innovation. We are proud to deepen our investment by driving local job creation, building cloud skills, and creating opportunities for growth and collaboration with our local customers and AWS Partners.\"\n\n\"Our government is committed to positioning our domestic industries for long-term growth and sustainability. The powerful digital infrastructure being established by Amazon Web Services near Calgary, Alberta will support Canadian developers, startups, large enterprises and academic institutions in their work by enabling access to AWS's powerful advanced cloud technologies,\" said The Hon.

AWS Regions are composed of Availability Zones that place infrastructure in separate and distinct geographic locations. Availability Zones are located far enough from each other to support customers' business continuity, but near enough to provide low latency for high availability applications that use multiple Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone has independent power, cooling, and physical security and is connected through redundant, ultra-low-latency networks. AWS customers focused on high availability can design their applications to run in multiple Availability Zones to achieve even greater fault tolerance.\n\nRead the Latest blog from us: AI And Cloud- The Perfect Match\n\nWith the launch of the new AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region, AWS becomes the first major cloud services provider to have an infrastructure region in Western Canada. The launch of the AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region provides customers with more options to run workloads with even greater resilience and availability, and to securely store data in Canada, while providing even lower latency across the country to drive greater productivity, more efficient business operations, and enhanced real-time application performance. Customers can now use the AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region, in addition to the AWS Canada (Central) Region, for use cases such as disaster recovery and can run their mission-critical applications across multiple AWS Regions in Canada with even higher levels of resilience and availability. Customers also have access to advanced AWS technologies to accelerate innovation, including compute, storage, networking, business applications, developer tools, data analytics, security, ML, and AI. As part of its infrastructure across the country, AWS has launched eight total Amazon CloudFront locations in Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. Amazon CloudFront is a highly secure and programmable content delivery network (CDN) that accelerates the delivery of data, videos, applications, and APIs to users worldwide, with low latency and high transfer speeds. In addition, AWS has announced AWS Local Zones in Toronto and Vancouver. AWS Local Zones are a type of AWS infrastructure deployment that places compute, storage, database, and other select services closer to customers for applications that require single-digit millisecond latency to end users.\n\nAWS also released an economic impact study estimating the company's projected spending on the construction and operation of its two AWS infrastructure Regions in Canada will support an average of more than 9,300 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs at external businesses annually, with a planned investment of more than $17.9 billion (approx. CA $24.8 billion) through 2037. The new AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region, specifically, is estimated to support an average of more than 1,300 FTE jobs annually, and AWS plans to invest more than $2.9 billion (approx. CA $4 billion) in Alberta through 2037. These jobs, including construction, facility maintenance, engineering, telecommunications, and others within the country's broader economy, will be part of the AWS supply chain in Canada.

Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge and became its first signatory in 2019. As part of its Climate Pledge commitment, Amazon is on a path to power its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of the original 2030 target. See Amazon's public methodology for more on its approach. In 2022, Amazon set a new corporate record for the most renewable energy announced by a single company in one year and remains the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy -- a position it's held since 2020, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Amazon now has 479 renewable energy projects in 26 countries. Additionally, AWS will be water positive by 2030, returning more water to communities than it uses in its direct operations.\n\nWith a total of four renewable energy projects in Canada, Amazon is currently the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the country, according to Bloomberg NEF. Once operational, the projects will generate more than 2.3 million megawatt hours (MWH) of clean energy - enough to power 1.69 million Canadian homes. Amazon recently announced its first wind farm in Vulcan County, Alberta, and has previously invested in two solar farms, as well as a rooftop solar energy project at an Amazon delivery station in Nisku, Alberta. Amazon's solar and wind projects are also helping benefit the local economy in Canada. New economic data from Amazon shows the company's investments in utility-scale renewable energy projects generated an estimated CA $478 million in local economic investment, and contributed CA $206 million in total gross domestic product (GDP) from 2014 through 2022. These projects will contribute to powering Amazon's global infrastructure.",

        "title": "Hybrid Cloud in 2024: Trends and Predictions - DevOps.com",
        "body": "Hybrid cloud environments are becoming increasingly pivotal for DevOps teams, primarily due to their ability to bridge the gap between the rapid deployment of public cloud resources and the security and control of private cloud infrastructure. This blending of environments provides DevOps teams with flexibility and scalability, which is crucial for operating continuous integration and continuous deployment (CI/CD) in large enterprises.\n\nIn a hybrid cloud setup, DevOps teams can swiftly deploy and test new applications in a cost-effective and scalable public cloud environment. Once the applications are ready for production, they can be seamlessly transitioned to a private cloud or on-premises environment, where they benefit from enhanced security and control. This allows DevOps teams to optimize their workflows, reduce time to market, and respond more effectively to business needs.\n\nThe hybrid cloud also enables a more collaborative and agile working environment. DevOps teams can leverage various tools and platforms available in the public cloud while ensuring that sensitive data and critical applications are securely managed in the private cloud. This both enhances operational efficiency and improves compliance with data governance and regulatory requirements. These benefits will make hybrid cloud an indispensable asset for DevOps teams in 2024 and beyond.\n\nLet's start with a brief definition. A hybrid cloud is a computing environment that combines a public cloud and a private cloud by allowing data and applications to be shared between them. This combination allows businesses to enjoy the best of both worlds, leveraging the scalability and cost efficiencies of public cloud platforms while enjoying the security and control offered by private cloud infrastructure.\n\nThis hybrid cloud model provides businesses with more deployment options and greater flexibility to scale computing resources. It also helps in reducing capital expenditure and improving security by allowing sensitive data to be stored on a private cloud. A hybrid cloud strategy enables businesses to allocate resources efficiently, keeping less critical applications on the public cloud, while mission-critical applications run on the private cloud.\n\nThe hybrid cloud market is in a state of rapid growth and evolution. As businesses increasingly recognize the benefits of a hybrid approach, the adoption of hybrid cloud strategies is on the rise.\n\nIn a world where digital transformation is the norm, hybrid cloud computing has emerged as a key enabler. It offers the flexibility needed to adapt quickly to changing business conditions, the scalability to handle sudden increases in workload, and the security to protect sensitive data. These benefits have made hybrid cloud a cornerstone of digital transformation strategies.\n\nHowever, the journey to hybrid cloud is not without its challenges. Businesses are grappling with issues related to data security, compliance, integration, and management. There are also complexities related to workload portability, interoperability, and the need for skilled resources. Despite these challenges, the adoption of hybrid cloud continues to grow as businesses seek to leverage its benefits to drive innovation and competitive advantage.\n\nMany industries, including the banking and finance sector, healthcare, retail, manufacturing, and even the government sector, are seeing increased adoption of hybrid cloud strategies. This trend is driven by the need for greater agility and flexibility, better cost management, and improved security and compliance.\n\nIn the healthcare sector, for example, hybrid cloud is enabling the integration of disparate systems, facilitating the sharing of patient data, and supporting telehealth initiatives. In the banking sector, it is helping to manage risk, improve customer experiences, and drive innovation. In retail, hybrid cloud is supporting omnichannel strategies, personalizing customer experiences, and improving supply chain efficiency.\n\nThe hybrid cloud landscape in 2024 will be shaped by advancements in cloud technologies. Technologies like containers and Kubernetes are simplifying the deployment and management of applications, making it easier for businesses to adopt a hybrid cloud strategy. The rise of serverless computing is also contributing to the growth of hybrid cloud by eliminating the need to manage servers and allowing developers to focus on writing code.\n\nFurthermore, advancements in networking technologies are making it easier to connect and integrate public and private clouds. The emergence of 5G is expected to further accelerate the adoption of hybrid cloud by providing the high-speed connectivity needed to support real-time applications.\n\nThe integration of artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) into hybrid cloud environments is a trend that is rapidly gaining momentum. One key aspect of this integration is the ability to use AI for better resource management within the hybrid cloud. AI algorithms can analyze patterns in data usage and application performance, allowing for more efficient allocation of resources across public and private cloud environments.\n\nFurthermore, AI and ML are also facilitating better data management and analytics. Cloud-based services are making AI/ML more accessible to businesses of all sizes. By integrating these technologies, businesses can unlock insights from vast amounts of data stored across different cloud environments.\n\nBy 2024, the integration of edge computing with hybrid cloud architectures is expected to grow significantly. Edge computing brings data processing closer to the location where it is needed, optimizing response times and saving bandwidth.\n\nIn a hybrid cloud context, this means that organizations can process critical data at the edge, in real-time, while still leveraging the cloud for less time-sensitive tasks. This integration is particularly beneficial for industries like manufacturing and autonomous vehicles, where real-time data processing is crucial. The combination of edge and hybrid cloud computing enables businesses to harness the power of cloud computing while maintaining the speed and efficiency of edge processing.\n\nIn 2024, we anticipate significant advancements in the security and compliance aspects of hybrid cloud environments. As these environments become more complex, the need for robust security measures that span both public and private clouds is crucial. Enhanced encryption techniques, more sophisticated identity and access management systems, and advanced threat detection tools will become standard.\n\nAdditionally, we expect to see the development of more streamlined compliance benchmarks and frameworks designed specifically for hybrid cloud architectures, simplifying the process of adhering to various regulatory standards and ensuring data privacy and protection across multiple platforms.\n\nThe year 2024 is likely to witness substantial innovations in cloud management platforms, driven by the need to manage complex hybrid cloud environments more efficiently. These platforms will offer enhanced capabilities in terms of automation, orchestration, and unified management across multiple cloud services.\n\nThe use of AI and machine learning for predictive analysis, resource optimization, and proactive problem resolution will become more prevalent. These platforms will also provide better tools for cost management and analytics, giving businesses a more granular understanding of their cloud usage and enabling more cost-effective decision-making.\n\nAs hybrid cloud environments continue to evolve, 2024 will likely see a rise in more customizable and flexible cloud solutions tailored to specific business needs. Providers will offer a range of options that allow businesses to mix and match services from both public and private clouds, creating highly personalized cloud environments.\n\nThis customization will extend to aspects like security, performance, and compliance, allowing businesses to fine-tune their cloud infrastructure to their specific requirements. Such flexibility will be particularly beneficial for businesses in niche markets or those with unique operational needs, enabling them to leverage the power of cloud computing without compromising on their specific requirements.\n\nBy 2024, hybrid cloud computing will have significantly evolved, becoming a critical component in the digital transformation strategies of various industries. This technology offers a blend of public and private cloud benefits, crucial for DevOps teams in terms of flexibility, scalability, and security. The integration of advanced technologies like AI, machine learning, and edge computing will enhance resource management, data analytics, and real-time data processing. Additionally, the hybrid cloud's role in ensuring agility, better cost management, and compliance is expected to drive its wider adoption across sectors like healthcare, banking, retail, and government.",

Conversely, it downgraded Salesforce (NYSE:CRM) to equal weight on the basis of the sharp run up in shares this year, noting that much of the value from the margin expansion story has been \"captured.\"\n\n\"Despite still palatable valuation levels ([less than] 25x EV/CY25 FCF), our diligence suggests the next growth drivers are further off than expected, and we expect CRM shares to prove more range-bound in [2024],\" the analysts wrote.\n\nThe firm also expects a \"selective bounce back\" in the small and mid-cap space in software.\n\n\"Regardless of if macro improves in '24, we're expecting some of these forgotten names [with company] specific catalysts and/or inexpensive valuations to stage a comeback, given potential for upside to estimates + favorably skewed risk/reward,\" the analysts wrote.\n\nZoominfo Technologies (ZI) is its top pick and it upgraded both Guidewire Software (GWRE) and Blend Labs (BLND) to overweight from equal weight, respectively.\n\nThe fifth and final theme is that companies that were boosted by the pandemic are \"still stuck\" and \"creative fixes [have] become necessary.\"\n\n\"While we've exercised patience with some of the pandemic 'winners', it's become clear over the course of the past yr that many are still struggling to find stable footing,\" the analysts wrote. \"Given lack of clear growth/margin strategy going fwd, we're expecting an uptick in activist/M&A interest in '24 aiming to address these challenged models, but aren't expecting substantive fixes in all cases.\"\n\nAs such, the firm downgraded Zoom Video (NASDAQ:ZM) to underweight from equal weight; DocuSign (DOCU) to underweight from equal weight; RingCentral (RNG) to equal weight from overweight; Everbridge (EVBG) to underweight from equal weight; Clear Secure (YOU) to underweight from equal weight; and Kaltura (KLTR) to underweight from equal weight.\n\nAnalysts are largely cautious on Salesforce (CRM).

        "title": "This app is changing the game for vision-impaired makeup lovers",
        "body": "For those with low-vision or blindness, putting on makeup is typically a two-person job. Sure, you can learn to dab on concealer or blend out your bronzer with a couple of #GetReadyWithMe TikToks (that is, if the creator talks out their steps versus just overlaying an ~aesthetic~ Mitski song or \"My BFF dated my ex\" story time). But to make sure your foundation is fully blended and your eyeliner isn't smudged, you're likely going to need to ask someone for help -- whether it be a family member, friend, or literal stranger -- and just hope they give you an honest answer. This is obviously less than ideal, and it gave Estée Lauder Companies an idea: Voice-enabled Makeup Assistant (VMA), a voice-enabled app to help people with vision loss and blindness check their makeup application.\n\n\"We identified that there was a huge accessibility gap in the beauty industry for those with disabilities, specifically for individuals who are low vision and blind,\" says Lamia Drew, global inclusive technology director at Estée Lauder Companies. So after years of research, interviews, and testing done in tandem with people in the low-vision and blind communities, Estée Lauder launched VMA in January 2023. \"Many people told us that when they put on makeup, they would have to send a selfie to a person that they trusted to give them honest feedback,\" Drew explains. \"The consistent theme really was that many people in this community felt like their makeup routine created a dependence on others and we want VMA to change that.\"\n\nEssentially, VMA uses artificial intelligence and augmented reality to analyse the makeup on the user's face entirely through voice prompts. So after you brush your foundation on, you can ask the app to check your face to make sure it's blended down your jawline or around your temples. Or if you swipe on lipstick, you can ask the app to check if there's a smudge after sipping on your coffee. Consider it a brutally honest best friend who's always on call to check your look.\n\nNearly a year after its debut on the app store, VMA has over 1,100 downloads in the U.S. and over 1,700 downloads in the UK. Four women with varying levels of vision who've been testing and working on the app since the initial development phase told Cosmopolitan how this technology has changed their makeup routines, and in turn, their lives. Keep reading for their stories in their own words.\n\nClick here to check out the VMA app.\n\nI'm a third-year law student in Austin, Texas, hoping to pursue disability rights. I lost my vision when I was 5 years old, so I've been blind pretty much my whole life, yet I've been wearing makeup for nearly a decade. It's a way to present myself to other people, but it's also a ritual for me every morning. I find doing my makeup very grounding before I have to start my day.\n\nBefore the app, I always had one foundation, one bronzer, one blush, and one highlighter. I never experimented because I live alone and had to have a routine nailed down that I always knew worked for me. I had to be really familiar with a product to use it well, to the point that I would memorize how many times I tapped my brush on the powder and how many swipes it took on my face. Otherwise, I needed so much feedback from people to tell me what looked good and what looked symmetrical.\n\nWhen I started using the app after working with an organization called Disability:In, makeup stopped being just a ritualistic moment for me -- it also became a form of creativity. I love bright red lipstick, but I would only ever do it when I had somebody to check it -- plus, I needed someone who would be with me throughout the day to continue to check it to make sure it wasn't smeared or faded. I also love eyeshadow, but I basically just never did it because it was too risky -- even if I get one eye good, how do I know the other eye matches? Now, it's fun to be able to be creative with makeup and try out new techniques and shades. And I can finally go to the bathroom midday and check how my makeup looks by myself -- for the very first time in my life.\n\nThese days, I see a TikTok suggesting smudging a brown eyeshadow on your lash line to make brown eyes pop. Before, I would have thought, Sound cool, but can't try it. Now, I'm able to play around and figure it out with the app. Being able to participate in these fun things I see on TikTok, an app I'm constantly scrolling on, has been everything. It's empowering to finally feel so independent.\n\nI strive to be as independent as I can with everything that I do. So when I got the chance to help develop this app all the way in Colorado Springs, Colorado, I was so excited. It's super incredible to just have something like this out there. A real game-changer.\n\nI think back to when I was in high school and first became interested in makeup. I'd experiment, but certain products like lipstick were challenging. Overall, the hardest part of makeup for me is that I'd have to get people to check it every single time. The older I get, the less I care about it, but when I was younger, I was so easily embarrassed, so I would never want to go out with weird, blotchy makeup. I just remember spending so much time in the bathroom doing my makeup and then getting frustrated and just asking someone else to do it. Ultimately, makeup was time-consuming and deflating, and I felt like I just couldn't do it myself. That was something that really bothered me. It felt like it went against my entire definition of independence.\n\nNow, with VMA, it will hopefully minimize the logistics and stress of applying makeup for a lot of low-vision people. When I am more independent and can do my makeup myself, I can go out with so much more confidence. Like, I did my makeup just like everybody else. And I feel good about it! That's a huge part of self-confidence for me.\n\nThe app has gone through so many rounds of reviews and testing, and it's been really cool to experience them develop it right in front of me as I provide feedback. For example, at first, I didn't love the voice; I use synthesized voices pretty much every single day, so I think it's important to hear a voice that sounds pleasant. And in the next update, the voice was different -- not overly positive or fake-sounding.\n\nAnd now, I think the more I use this app, the more I trust that it works well and the more comfortable I feel going out with makeup and feeling good about it. Whether it's blending, missing spots or getting mascara on my cheeks, the app is always able to help with those and give me feedback to fix it. It adds a new layer of independence not having to rely on others. Just get the app out, put on your makeup, get a check, and then you're done. It's really levelling the playing field.\n\nI'm an athlete and always working out and sweating, so I don't wear much makeup these days, but I love that I have the option and picture myself using the app when I go to a work conference or when I go to the Paralympics. I can do my makeup and go stand on the world stage and feel confident being independent. Like, I think that'd be cool.\n\nFollow Hannah on Instagram\n\nI'm a college student in the Northern Virginia/Washington D.C. area, and I have low vision due to my albinism. Everything to me is like watching a super low-res YouTube video. I love art, and I've always been curious about makeup because I saw it as another art form. But it just seemed difficult for me because I don't have the best hand-eye coordination when trying to see what's on my face. Getting really close in a mirror doesn't help. So if I wanted to wear makeup for parties or events, my mom would help me. And now that I'm in college, my roommate helps.\n\nSo I didn't really wear makeup aside from special events because it felt too complicated. But when I came to college, I realized getting ready was part of the fun experience. I started feeling a little left out because I didn't really know how to do makeup, especially by myself. Disability:In sent out an email looking for low-vision people with an interest in makeup. I reached out, started beta-testing the app, and have used it ever since.\n\nThe app has encouraged me to start branching out and trying makeup on my own without having to ask for help. I can do it for myself and choose my own colours, feeling more confident that I'm going out looking nice. VMA has encouraged me to wear makeup more, honestly. Now it's part of my going-out routine. I open up the app, and I'll throw on a little lip gloss, maybe touch up my spots, or even swipe on some glitter. Glitter eyeshadow is the best thing ever.\n\nWhen I open the app, it tells me the order to put on my makeup. So I'll start by putting on foundation myself, then ask the app to scan my face to tell me if there are any spots I missed or if it doesn't look symmetrical. Then, I'll touch it up and ask again, repeating that loop until it says my foundation is good. I move on to eyeshadow or lipstick following the same process: Zoom in, ask if it looks okay, and receive feedback on what needs to be fixed. It gives me so much independence, especially when I'm going out with friends and we can all get ready at the same time. I don't always have to ask them to check over my makeup.\n\nA lot of people tend to feel like those who are blind or have low vision wouldn't care about art, makeup or movies. But no one wants to be told that something isn't for them. Being able to participate in something that's typically only been considered as a sighted thing makes me feel hopeful and really happy.\n\nFollow Esha on Instagram\n\nI was born three months early, which led to retinopathy of prematurity. Currently, I have no sight in my left eye and very, very little sight in my right eye. But I'm a trooper. I'm a retired social worker living in Hauppauge, New York, and I stopped working to help my daughter with my grandson when he was diagnosed with autism. During the pandemic, I felt like I needed to keep busy and do more, so I joined a chapter of the National Federation of the Blind where I met a woman who was involved in the VMA beta testing.\n\nI was excited. I was hopeful. Even if the app didn't work, it'd be a star just for existing. Because finally, there's a beauty company that understands that people with disabilities are people and that beauty is not what you put on your face, it's about what gives you confidence and empowers you. So I thought, Well, this app, if it does nothing else but empower people who have disabilities to say, \"I'm worth it,\" then it's a beautiful thing.\n\nIt makes me feel proud that it exists. I'm proud to say that I feel included. It's an inclusion thing for me, like somebody is finally seeing people with visual disabilities. We're no longer invisible and we're no longer thought of as people who wouldn't care to wear makeup.",

But it just seemed difficult for me because I don't have the best hand-eye coordination when trying to see what's on my face. Getting really close in a mirror doesn't help. So if I wanted to wear makeup for parties or events, my mom would help me. And now that I'm in college, my roommate helps.\n\nSo I didn't really wear makeup aside from special events because it felt too complicated. But when I came to college, I realized getting ready was part of the fun experience. I started feeling a little left out because I didn't really know how to do makeup, especially by myself. Disability:In sent out an email looking for low-vision people with an interest in makeup. I reached out, started beta-testing the app, and have used it ever since.\n\nThe app has encouraged me to start branching out and trying makeup on my own without having to ask for help. I can do it for myself and choose my own colours, feeling more confident that I'm going out looking nice. VMA has encouraged me to wear makeup more, honestly. Now it's part of my going-out routine. I open up the app, and I'll throw on a little lip gloss, maybe touch up my spots, or even swipe on some glitter. Glitter eyeshadow is the best thing ever.\n\nWhen I open the app, it tells me the order to put on my makeup. So I'll start by putting on foundation myself, then ask the app to scan my face to tell me if there are any spots I missed or if it doesn't look symmetrical. Then, I'll touch it up and ask again, repeating that loop until it says my foundation is good. I move on to eyeshadow or lipstick following the same process: Zoom in, ask if it looks okay, and receive feedback on what needs to be fixed. It gives me so much independence, especially when I'm going out with friends and we can all get ready at the same time. I don't always have to ask them to check over my makeup.\n\nA lot of people tend to feel like those who are blind or have low vision wouldn't care about art, makeup or movies. But no one wants to be told that something isn't for them. Being able to participate in something that's typically only been considered as a sighted thing makes me feel hopeful and really happy.\n\nI was born three months early, which led to retinopathy of prematurity. Currently, I have no sight in my left eye and very, very little sight in my right eye. But I'm a trooper. I'm a retired social worker living in Hauppauge, New York, and I stopped working to help my daughter with my grandson when he was diagnosed with autism. During the pandemic, I felt like I needed to keep busy and do more, so I joined a chapter of the National Federation of the Blind where I met a woman who was involved in the VMA beta testing.\n\nI was excited. I was hopeful. Even if the app didn't work, it'd be a star just for existing. Because finally, there's a beauty company that understands that people with disabilities are people and that beauty is not what you put on your face, it's about what gives you confidence and empowers you. So I thought, Well, this app, if it does nothing else but empower people who have disabilities to say, \"I'm worth it,\" then it's a beautiful thing.\n\nIt makes me feel proud that it exists. I'm proud to say that I feel included. It's an inclusion thing for me, like somebody is finally seeing people with visual disabilities. We're no longer invisible and we're no longer thought of as people who wouldn't care to wear makeup.",

        "title": "Is Cloudflare Stock a Buy?",
        "body": "Either Cloudflare (NYSE: NET) possesses good timing or perhaps it's blessed with prescience. The provider of cloud-based services debuted on Wall Street in 2019 at $15 per share when cloud computing was rising in popularity. Mere months later the COVID-19 pandemic hit, and due to society's sudden need for cloud-based internet solutions to to take classes or work remotely, Cloudflare stock rocketed past $200 per share.\n\nIts stock returned to earth since then. But on Dec. 15, Cloudflare shares reached a 52-week high after Fortune magazine listed the company among the top 10 businesses with long-term growth potential.\n\nAt this point, does it make sense to buy Cloudflare shares? Digging into the company in more detail can help to determine if now is a good time to invest.\n\nCloudflare tackles the complex task of helping organizations maintain a digital presence. It does this by offering several cloud-based services centered around digital content delivery across an internet network that's fast, safe, and robust at a reasonable cost.\n\nEvery time you visit a website, your device retrieves it from a server in a data center, and the site must load quickly or you may not stick around. Cloudflare delivers speed through a network of data centers spanning over 100 countries around the globe.\n\nStill, a robust network isn't useful unless it's safe and secure from hackers. So cybersecurity is also one of Cloudflare's offerings. Its network security was able to withstand a massive cyberattack generating the equivalent of all the internet traffic in the world.\n\nCloudflare's convergence of a cloud computing network and cybersecurity, referred to as a secure access service edge (SASE), proved another prescient move. SASE is expanding rapidly as more organizations transition to cloud computing.\n\nThe SASE market grew 30% in 2023 to $9 billion according to research firm Gartner, and is expected to reach $25 billion by 2027. Cloudflare's all-in-one SASE solution is already benefiting from this industry tailwind as demonstrated by the company's customer growth.\n\nAt the end of last year, Cloudflare reported more than 160,000 paying customers, nearly double the number it had after its 2019 initial public offering. Customers include U.S. government agencies shedding multiple vendors in favor of Cloudflare's all-in-one offering.\n\nThis customer growth translated into rapidly expanding revenue. In the third quarter, Cloudflare generated sales of $335.6 million, a 32% year-over-year increase.\n\nIts strong Q3 results were the latest in a multiyear trend of rising revenue.\n\nThe company's sales growth is expected to continue. For the fourth quarter, Cloudflare is forecasting double-digit year-over-year revenue growth of at least $352 million, up from 2022's $274.7 million.\n\nThe company's free cash flow (FCF) is also strengthening. FCF provides insight into the cash available for Cloudflare to invest in its business, pay debt obligations, and repurchase shares. Its Q3 FCF was $34.9 million compared to negative FCF of $4.6 million in the prior year.\n\nYet despite Cloudflare's successes, the company isn't profitable. Cloudflare exited Q3 with a net loss of $23.5 million. Because of its strong revenue growth, however, Cloudflare's lack of profitability isn't a concern at this time.\n\nIn fact, many tech companies operate for years without a profit as they prioritize growing their businesses. And a positive sign is that Cloudflare's Q3 net loss improved over the prior year's loss of 42.5 million.\n\nAnd now, there's the advent of artificial intelligence. Cloudflare's prescient gifts came into play once more since, years ago, the company prepared its data centers to support AI's hardware needs. That foresight is proving beneficial.\n\nCloudflare's network can handle the complex tasks executed by AI systems. As a result, the company already has customers wanting to put billions of AI tasks onto Cloudflare's network. The company believes this customer demand will continue to increase, and Cloudflare's foresight preparing for AI gives it a competitive advantage.\n\nCloudflare also benefits from the tailwind of growth across multiple industries. The cloud computing market is expected to increase from $678 billion in 2023 to $2.4 trillion by 2030, which also boosts SASE's market expansion. In addition, the AI market is forecast to grow from $142.3 billion in 2022 to $1.8 trillion by 2030.\n\nWith growth in these industries and its strong IT infrastructure, Cloudflare is positioned to continue its success into 2024, making the stock a buy. Because Cloudflare shares hover near a 52-week high, it's worth taking a small stake now, then using dollar-cost averaging to add to your position later should the price dip.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Cloudflare right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Cloudflare, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Cloudflare wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.

        "title": "Christopher Schobert's Top 10 Films of 2023",
        "body": "Following The Film Stage's collective top 50 films of 2023, as part of our year-end coverage, our contributors are sharing their personal top 10 lists.\n\nMany of the most memorable moments of my life have revolved around cinema. (Let's not debate whether that is a good thing.) And 2023 was no exception. There was a twentieth-anniversary screening of the mesmerizing Mulholland Drive at Buffalo's North Park Theatre featuring a performance from the remarkable Rebekah Del Rio. That was a biggie, but many of my most indelible 2023 cinema memories include my children. In July, my wife and our two kiddos had a rare group cinema outing (generally, the four of us have little interest in seeing the same thing) to Barbie on its opening day, and I have rarely seen my then-eight-year-old daughter more genuinely excited to dance the night away. A few weeks earlier my son was similarly pumped for Indiana Jones and the Dial of Destiny -- his first (and only) chance to see a new Indy vehicle on the big screen -- and he and I both enjoyed it for what it was. We rented a theater at the Dipson Flix Stadium 10 in Buffalo for my daughter's birthday, and watching a group of energetic nin-year-olds belt out \"Under the Sea\" during The Little Mermaid was downright heartwarming. And in October, I took my daughter and a friend to see Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, and for them, it was the next best thing to seeing her live. (Full disclosure: I had to fight the urge to place Eras in my top fifteen. Yes, I was that captivated. Please don't tell me to calm down.)\n\nWhen it comes to solo cinema-going, there was Miyazaki -- specifically, seeing The Boy and the Heron at September's Toronto International Film Festival. I was spellbound by the master's return to filmmaking, and seeing it at the splendid Roy Thomson Hall made the experience even more special.\n\nAs you will see, Heron has prominent placement on my list of top 2023 films. The group of fifteen below could just as easily have included The Holdovers, Barbie, American Fiction, Napoleon, Dream Scenario, Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse, Taylor Swift: The Eras Tour, The Wonderful World of Henry Sugar, Master Gardener, Mission Impossible: Dead Reckoning -- Part One, The Taste of Things, BlackBerry, Beau Is Afraid, Passages, Showing Up, Infinity Pool, Asteroid City, The Royal Hotel, Maestro, and several others. I should note that, for various reasons, I've not yet had the chance to see Poor Things, The Color Purple, and The Iron Claw. That's life. (Best restoration goes to Farewell My Concubine. And the most memorable first-time watches for me were David Byrne's True Stories and Jerzy Skolimowski's Deep End.)\n\nHonorable mentions: The Zone of Interest, Anatomy of a Fall, The Killer, How to Blow Up a Pipeline, Past Lives\n\n10. Emily (Frances O'Connor)\n\nEmily, the directorial debut for Mansfield Park and A.I.: Artificial Intelligence star Frances O'Connor, was one of the more remarkably assured first efforts in recent memory. Shot with breathtaking beauty and acted with extraordinary emotion and grace, this exploration of the life and development of Emily Brontë is a profoundly enveloping experience. While it is unclear how much of the film is historically accurate and how much is conjecture, O'Connor's account of the author of Wuthering Heights feels respectful and well-reasoned. With a heartbreaking performance from star Emma Mackey and a gorgeous score by Abel Korzeniowski, not to mention O'Connor's ingenious script, Emily deserved much more attention upon release.\n\n9. Oppenheimer (Christopher Nolan)\n\nI am finding it difficult to conjure a fresh take on Christopher Nolan's Robert Oppenheimer biopic, perhaps a result of reading so, so much about the film since its release in July. Thinking about it now, though, what impresses me most with Oppenheimer -- beyond the performances of Cillian Murphy and company, the time-hopping screenplay, and its overall technical mastery -- is that it is truly a film of ideas. Big, complex, sometimes ugly ideas. In a blockbuster summer release? Damn.\n\n8. Priscilla (Sofia Coppola)\n\nPriscilla Presley has long seemed like a celebrity unlikely to ever truly escape the shadow of the man she was once married to; that's likely to be the case when your spouse was Elvis Presley. Sofia Coppola''s Priscilla, then, is a bold and imaginative attempt at putting this (one-time) household name in the spotlight on her own -- an attempt that more than succeeds. It is clear what drew Coppola to Priscilla's story; she is in many ways the prototypical Coppola heroine. (I adored this recent New York Times headline: \"Sofia Coppola and All the Sad Girls.\") By the time Dolly Parton's \"I Will Always Love You\" soars on the soundtrack, Priscilla Presley (played with wounded grace by the splendid Callie Spaeny) feels like an individual whose real life -- her life without Elvis -- is just about to begin.\n\n7. Ferrari (Michael Mann)\n\nEnzo Ferrari is the most haunted Michael Mann protagonist since Manhunter's Will Graham. And he is just as obsessive as William Peterson's FBI agent. Fittingly, Mann's quest to bring Ferrari to the screen was similarly consuming. Adam Driver gives a fierce performance as Ferrari, a driver-turned-mogul who makes a daily stop at his son's resting place, juggles a fiery wife (Penélope Cruz, never better) and a mistress and child, and attempts to keep his struggling automaker afloat. The coming Mille Miglia race could change everything, and in typical Mann fashion, the quest overtakes all elements of Ferrari's life. Then... shocking events occur, and Ferrari moves from biopic to tragedy. This is a stunning film, and one of Mann's late-period greats.\n\n6. All of Us Strangers (Andrew Haigh)\n\nThe year's most astonishing ghost story, All of Us Strangers is a massively affecting drama about the apparitions of our youth finding us in adulthood. Andrew Scott's Adam lost his parents years before but remains a man gripped with torment. His deceased parents -- played by the stupendous Claire Foy and Jamie Bell -- reappear in his life, seemingly offering a chance for closure. Meanwhile, a neighbor sweetly played by Paul Mescal offers an opportunity for love. Nothing is quite as it seems, though, and Haigh stages it all with graceful, lump-in-your-throat terror. (I'll never hear Blur's \"Death of a Party\" again without thinking of Scott's heart-wrenching night at the club.) In its final moments, All of Us Strangers somehow becomes even greater, moving from deep anguish to real transcendence.\n\n5. Afire (Christian Petzold)\n\n\"I find that as soon as there's a plot, a narrative, there are also certain laws,\" says Christian Petzold in a 2003 interview featured in Christian Petzold: Interviews from the University Press of Mississippi; I covered the book here. \"And films are all about either laws or criminals who break laws. You can apply that to plot. There must be a law, and you have to rub up against this law. That's what it's about.\" In his latest film, Afire, Petzold once again wants to defy the logic of all plot laws. Friendships are complicated, manuscripts aren't very good, and love? It ain't easy to connect, especially when our protagonist, Leon (played with note-perfect annoyance by Thomas Schubert), is mostly a jerk. (Alternate title: The Worst Person in the World.) Afire never moves down the expected paths, right up to its tragic conclusion. It is a slippery, disorienting thing. And when Afire's end credits run, it is impossible not to be moved.\n\n4. May December (Todd Haynes)\n\nThe brilliant, provocative May December is a Todd Haynes masterpiece. Another Todd Haynes masterpiece, that is, following Superstar: The Karen Carpenter Story, Poison, Safe, Velvet Goldmine, Far from Heaven... well, every Haynes' effort, really. He is arguably the most consistent director on the planet, and May December is his sharpest, most go-for-the-jugular film since Carol. It is also Haynes' funniest film yet, albeit one with performances (from Charles Melton, especially) that also earn tears. Its final scene is the film's greatest joke of all. Sublime performances (Melton, Natalie Portman, Julianne Moore), a devilishly smart script (from Samy Burch), an undeniably juicy hook -- May December is a gem that improves with every viewing.\n\n3. The Boy and the Heron (Hayao Miyazaki)\n\nThe opportunity to watch the long-awaited return of director/animator Hayao Miyazaki was, for me, the clear highlight of TIFF23. Months later, I'm still buzzing over The Boy and the Heron. Imaginative, moving, and boasting some of the most memorable moments of any recent animated film, it is undoubtedly one of Miyazaki's best. It is also wonderfully strange, often unsettling, and delightfully dark. It would be wonderful to see more from Miyazaki, but if this is it, The Boy and the Heron is a suitable ending. The fact that it debuted as the number one film at the American box office upon release is positively sublime.\n\n2. Killers of the Flower Moon (Martin Scorsese)\n\nA few weeks after the release of Scorsese's harrowing, appropriately exhausting adaptation of David Grann's book, a friend asked me where I would rank the film on the Marty filmography. (We all have a love/hate relationship with \"rankings,\" don't we?) The question threw me, because there is no simple answer. It almost does not seem fair to judge Killers of the Flower Moon against, well, any films, let alone Scorsese entries. So, let's just say that Killers of the Moon is another tremendous Martin Scorsese picture. And, more than that, it is a statement of regret that needed to be made. We should not take its ambition for granted.\n\n1. Fallen Leaves (Aki Kaurismäki)\n\nThroughout Aki Kaurismäki's Fallen Leaves, the audience hears radio news updates on the Ukraine War. That is a devastatingly large-scale conflict, of course, and it adds an air of despair to the small-scale conflicts at the heart of Fallen Leaves. Like Kaurismäki's last two films, Le Havre and The Other Side of Hope, Leaves alternates between moments of great humor and gentle melancholy. The performances of Alma Pöysti as Ansa and Jussi Vatanen as Holappa are a perfect match for this mix of emotions. Ansa is a lonely figure whose jobs come and go suddenly. Holappa is a laborer with a drinking problem, and little to cling to outside of his friend, Huotari (the delightfully deadpan Janne Hyytiäinen). Ansa and Holappa meet, come close to connection, lose each other, come close to connection again, lose each other again, and so on. Their lives are full of heartbreak and modest joys. Indeed, it is the little moments that make Fallen Leaves so memorable and satisfying. Ansa and a supermarket coworker walking away, hand in hand, after being fired. Holappa leaving a pile of cigarettes on the ground outside the cinema as he waits in vain for Ansa. The adorable dog who becomes her companion. The karaoke sequence. And that final stretch, an ending that feels both magical and refreshingly ordinary. Not every filmmaker can pull that off that mix. Kaurismäki can, and that makes Fallen Leaves a film to be treasured. To me, it was the finest film of 2023.\n\nExplore more of the best films of 2023.",

        "title": "2 Red-Hot Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks to Buy in 2023 and Beyond | The Motley Fool",
        "body": "Investors should buy these red-hot stocks for stable business models and solid gains.\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has undoubtedly been the major investment theme of 2023. Unsurprisingly, the improved investor sentiment will also positively impact several AI stocks. However, investors should only consider AI-powered companies with robust fundamentals and high-quality business models, especially if they are interested in long-term gains.\n\nHere's why Microsoft (MSFT 0.16%) and Snowflake (SNOW 0.03%) fit the bill.\n\nSince the 90s, Microsoft's name has been synonymous with the Windows operating system and Office productivity suite. However, lately, the company has become more famous for its Azure cloud computing platform and partnership with ChatGPT developer OpenAI.\n\nAlthough the past few quarters saw enterprises increasingly optimizing cloud spending, the trend seems to have started normalizing. Of course, the Microsoft Azure cloud computing business continues to be a major beneficiary of enterprises either shifting their workloads to the cloud or starting new AI-optimized workloads on the cloud.\n\nMicrosoft has integrated many OpenAI technologies into Azure to launch the Azure OpenAI service, enabling developers to build advanced AI applications using OpenAI's large language models (LLMs) and Azure's cloud-based AI infrastructure. The Microsoft-OpenAI partnership has also made Azure the exclusive cloud provider for all OpenAI's workloads.\n\nSubsequently, Azure saw revenue soar by 29% year over year in its fiscal 2024's first quarter (ended Sep. 30, 2023), of which three percentage points' growth was attributed to Azure AI services. The company saw improved per-user business and higher graphics processing unit (GPU) capacity and utilization for its Azure AI business in the first quarter.\n\nLately, Microsoft has also expanded its partnership with Oracle to enable customers to deploy mission-critical Oracle databases on Microsoft Azure data centers. This deal can bring even more customers to Microsoft's cloud platform. Further, the company has introduced two custom silicon chips, Azure Maia 100 and Cobalt 100, designed to power its Azure data centers for training LLMs. This move will help reduce Microsoft's reliance on external chip vendors.\n\nWhile solid demand for AI services is a major growth catalyst for Azure, Microsoft's personal computing business may also start recovering in line with the wider PC market in 2024. The company made Microsoft 365 Copilot, an AI assistant for its Microsoft 365 product suite, available to all enterprises starting in November.\n\nWith 40% of the Fortune 100 companies already using the AI assistant in preview mode, demand for Microsoft 365 Copilot looks to be strong. Priced at $30 per user per month, Microsoft 365 Copilot can also be a major revenue stream for the company in the coming months. These tailwinds make Microsoft a compelling pick in 2024.\n\nOnce an on-premise enterprise data warehouse for structured data, Snowflake has transformed itself into a cloud-native data platform. The platform helps organizations consolidate, store, and manage structured and unstructured data and workloads across departments, functions, and applications in the cloud. Snowflake also enables clients to process and share this proprietary data at scale to derive business insights for informed decision-making.\n\nSince the launch of ChatGPT, more and more enterprises have become interested in generative AI technologies. These companies are increasingly building LLMs to power customized generative AI applications. With its highly curated, secure, optimized enterprise data repository, organizations are using Snowflake's data platform to train LLMs on huge amounts of high-quality data.\n\nSnowflake's Data Marketplace, which enables clients to share proprietary data (buy, trade, or provide free access), is also pivotal in helping build more robust AI applications. In fact, 28% of its total customer data was shared in the third quarter of its fiscal 2024 (ended Oct. 31, 2023), up from 22% in the same quarter of the prior year.\n\nThe data-sharing activity was even more pronounced among the high-value customers, considering 73% of customers contributing $1 million or more in revenues shared data in the third quarter, up from 67% in the same quarter of the prior year. The data-sharing capability has not only made Snowflake's data platform more useful but also increased the customers' cost of switching to competitors. The data marketplace has also created a strong network effect for the company since it attracts more customers to join the platform, expanding Snowflake's data repository.\n\nFurthermore, instead of resting on its past laurels, Snowflake is further innovating to benefit effectively from the AI opportunity. The company recently introduced a fully managed service, Snowflake Cortex, to allow organizations to analyze data and build AI applications. The company's Document AI helps clients convert unstructured data into semi-structured data, thereby making it capable of analytical processing.\n\nSnowflake expects the target addressable market for cloud data platforms to be worth $248 billion by calendar 2026. With its extensive focus on data management and AI services and an annual run rate of around $2.6 billion, there is still significant future growth potential left for the company.",

        "title": "Graphics: What can be expected from China's economic work conference?",
        "body": "Chinese policy makers will continue to implement proactive fiscal policies and prudent monetary policies and underpin technological innovation, according to the meeting of the Political Bureau of CPC Central Committee.\n\nA number of international financial institutions, including UBS and Goldman Sachs, have expressed optimism about China's growth outlook for 2024 as they believe that domestic consumption will continue to recover, investment will continue to increase and exports will improve.\n\nThe International Monetary Fund (IMF) forecast that China's economy will increase by 5.4 percent in 2023 and 4.6 percent in 2024. UBS predicted the country's economic growth will stand at 5.2 percent in 2023 and 4.4 percent in 2024, while Goldman Sachs predict GDP growth to be 5.3 percent in 2023 and 4.8 percent in 2024.\n\n\"The proactive fiscal policies should be appropriately strengthened and improved in quality and efficiency, while the prudent monetary policies should be flexible, appropriate, precise, and effective,\" said the meeting.\n\nChina's central government announced in October it will issue 1 trillion yuan (about $140 billion) in additional government bonds, half of which will be transferred to local governments this year and another 500 billion yuan will be carried over to next year. As a result, the deficit-to-GDP ratio rose from 3 percent to 3.8 percent for 2023.\n\nChina can raise its budget deficit ratio next year to support the economic recovery because there is still space for the central government to issue more debt, according to Wang Yiming, a policy adviser to the central bank.\n\nThe upcoming CEWC may emphasize the need to speed up the allocation and better use of the special government bonds, and fiscal expenditures will be more directed to areas related to social issues and people's livelihood, according to UBS.\n\nUBS has said it is unlikely that the government will introduce large-scale direct income subsidies and/or consumption vouchers. The investment bank expected the government to set a budget deficit target of 3.5-3.8 percent in March next year.\n\nIn terms of monetary policy, UBS expected the central bank will lower the MLF policy interest rate by another 10-20 basis points and the reserve requirement ratio by 25 basis points next year, and credit growth to remain at a solid level of 9.5 percent in 2024.\n\nBanks may increase credit support to qualified real estate developers on whitelist, but may remain cautious about issuing large-scale working capital loans, according to UBS. It expected that the decline of real estate activities will be narrowed in 2024, so the drag on economic growth will weaken.\n\nGoldman Sachs believed that with the support of fiscal and monetary policies, the growth rate of China's manufacturing and infrastructure investment is expected to accelerate in 2024. UBS believed that in manufacturing, investment related to green transformation will remain strong.\n\nUBS also believed that investment in new energy, flood and waterlogging prevention and other water conservancy-related projects, urban agglomeration transportation networks, public utilities and public facilities have great growth potential.\n\n\"We should lead the building of a modern industrial system with technological innovation, and boost the resilience and security of industrial and supply chains,\" the meeting of the Political Bureau of CPC Central Committee added.\n\nIn 2024, technology industries related to new energy, artificial intelligence, bio-manufacturing, green and low carbon, as well as quantum computing will still be the top priority for development, according to Soochow Securities.",

        "title": "AI in the Packaging Market To Hit $ 5,375.28 Mn by 2032",
        "body": "The global market for artificial intelligence in packaging is poised for unprecedented growth. This article explores the astounding journey, projecting a remarkable surge from USD 2021.3 million in 2022 to an estimated USD 5,375.28 million by 2032, boasting a robust CAGR of 10.28% during the transformative period of 2023-2032.\n\nThe packaging industry is not an exception to how artificial intelligence (AI) is changing various industries. AI has emerged as a game-changer in the packaging industry due to the growth of e-commerce, shifting consumer demands, and the need for effective and sustainable packaging solutions. Numerous aspects of packaging, including design, production, quality assurance, and supply chain optimization, are being revolutionized by this technology.\n\nRiding the Waves: Factors Fueling AI in Packaging Expansion\n\nTechnological Advancements Propelling the Momentum\n\nIn the ever-evolving realm of packaging, technological strides serve as the driving force behind the exponential rise. AI, with its innovative applications, is reshaping the packaging landscape by enhancing efficiency, accuracy, and adaptability.\n\nCAGR Unveiled: A Closer Look at Compounded Annual Growth\n\nDelving into the numbers, the Compound Annual Growth Rate (CAGR) of 10.28% acts as the heartbeat of this thriving market. This steady ascent signifies sustained progress, highlighting the industry's resilience and adaptability over the forecasted decade.\n\nAI is greatly enhancing the packaging industry's manufacturing procedures. Intelligent systems with computer vision capabilities can quickly and accurately find flaws or inconsistencies in packaging materials. This prevents waste and lowers the possibility of product recalls by guaranteeing that only high-quality packaging reaches the market. AI algorithms can also optimize packaging arrangements, maximizing material use and reducing excess packaging, which results in cost savings and improved sustainability.\n\nAI is also advancing the packaging industry's efforts to be environmentally friendly. Companies are increasingly looking for eco-friendly packaging solutions as environmental concerns rise. AI algorithms can evaluate the ecological effects of various packaging materials, assisting businesses in selecting environmentally friendly packaging options. AI can help packaging designs be optimized to use the least amount of material while maintaining product integrity, resulting in less waste and a smaller carbon footprint.\n\nUnveiling the Future of Packaging Inspection: Exploring AI-Powered Vision Systems\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) has been playing a significant role in driving sustainable packaging practices. One notable example is the application of AI by Amazon to optimize packaging and reduce product damage. Leveraging a machine learning model, Amazon analyses real-world customer complaint data to identify patterns and improve packaging materials for various products purchased through their online platform.\n\nThe Packaging Industry is Being Revolutionized by Artificial Intelligence\n\nThe packaging industry is changing due to artificial intelligence (AI), fuelled by several important factors. The adoption of AI technologies is a result of the increased demand for effective packaging solutions caused by the growth of e-commerce. Intelligent algorithms improve order fulfilment accuracy and waste reduction in e-commerce fulfilment centers' packaging processes. Incorporating AI in packaging is also influenced by shifting consumer demands and preferences. AI algorithms analyze consumer data to create personalized packaging experiences and increase brand loyalty. Concerns about sustainability are pushing businesses to use AI to improve packaging designs, use less material, and have a more negligible environmental impact.\n\nThe Role of the Food and Beverage Industry in Propelling Future Innovations\n\nThe food and beverage industry represents a significant artificial intelligence (AI) adoption market. This sector is fuelled by robust expansion in emerging markets like Asia Pacific, Africa, and Latin America.\n\nWithin this rapidly evolving market landscape, AI technologies offer valuable opportunities for optimizing supply chain management. By enhancing tracking capabilities throughout the supply chain, AI enables companies to elevate product quality control measures before reaching customers. This facilitates improved monitoring, traceability, and overall visibility, enhancing efficiency and customer satisfaction.\n\nNorth America's Continued Dominance in the Global Market: Projections and Outlook\n\nBetween 2023 and 2032, North America is projected to maintain its dominance in the global market. The region's growth is propelled by the rising adoption of AI technologies within the packaging industry and the establishment of collaborative efforts between public and private entities to introduce cutting-edge machinery. The convergence of high-end technologies like artificial intelligence (AI) and the Internet of Things (IoT) has garnered significant interest across various industrial sectors, driving increased demand for advanced packaging solutions among integrated device manufacturers (IDMs) and foundry suppliers.\n\nMachine Learning Takes the Lead in Uncovering the Fastest-Growing Market Segment in the AI Landscape\n\nThe market for artificial intelligence (AI) in packaging is segmented into machine learning (ML), machine vision, and other categories. Among these segments, ML is projected to experience the highest growth from 2023 to 2032. This growth is primarily driven by the increasing demand for ML in various areas such as data labelling, process automation, and content inspection within product quality assurance and quality control (QA/QC) processes. Ensuring accurate labelling of products is crucial to avoid inspection failures, customer dissatisfaction, and potential profit loss.\n\nUnleashing the Potential: AI-Powered Recycling Systems Transforming Packaging Sustainability\n\nBoth consumers and manufacturers have become increasingly aware of the ecological consequences of improper material recycling practices. With the world producing over 2.1 billion tons of garbage annually, only about 16% is being recycled. This alarming statistic highlights the urgent need for concerted efforts to improve recycling rates and reduce the environmental impact of waste accumulation.\n\nAs sustainability becomes a key focus for businesses and individuals alike, proper material recycling is gaining prominence. Recognizing the ecological cost of neglecting responsible recycling practices, stakeholders are actively seeking innovative solutions to tackle this global challenge. From a business perspective, embracing efficient and effective recycling strategies aligns with environmental goals and enhances brand reputation and consumer trust.\n\nComparative landscape\n\nThe comparative landscape of Artificial Intelligence (AI) in the Packaging Market comprises various players that contribute to developing and adopting AI technologies in the packaging industry. Market leaders in this landscape are established companies with a strong market presence, advanced AI technologies, and a wide range of AI-enabled packaging solutions. These companies set industry standards and drive innovation in the market.

        "title": "Announcement of the List of 2023 Golden Flag Awards Unveils Five Major Trends in Communication Strategies for the Chinese Market",
        "body": "BEIJING, Dec. 20, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- According to 17PR reports: the winners of the 2023 Golden Flag Award, the most authoritative and widely recognized brand communication award in China, were officially announced on December 1st, 2023.\n\nThe award-winning cases span diverse fields, such as pharmaceuticals, chemical engineering, finance, e-commerce, aviation, technology, baby care, food, automobiles, agriculture, government, transportation, sports, culture and tourism, entertainment, and cosmetics.\n\nProminent global companies such as Budweiser China, BMW China, JD.com, SAIC-GM, BD, Mars China, Bayer China, Roche's Pharmaceuticals Division, Lundbeck China, DHL, Cargill Investment, KFC China, Corning China, Adidas, McDonald's China, Huawei, Lenovo, Anta, and Volvo have showcased outstanding cases on the list.\n\nThese award-winning cases provide insights into the current communication strategies and trends in the Chinese market, many of which have gained significant traction over the past year.\n\nData from submissions for this year's Golden Flag Award reveals five major trends in brand communication strategies in the Chinese market:\n\n1. Practicing sustainable development has become a must for companies.\n\nThe concept of \"sustainable development\" is highly valued by companies in their communication with Chinese customers. The majority of exemplary cases focus on corporate social responsibility, ESG communication, environmental protection, and public welfare communication. They cover crucial areas of sustainable development, such as rural revitalization, protection of intangible cultural heritage, promotion of knowledge about rare diseases, support for vulnerable groups, and ecological protection and governance.\n\nCompanies of different scales and types are embracing long-termism and actively practicing sustainable development. This not only enhances brand resilience and the ability to guard against risks but also permanently empowers the brand's long-term value.\n\n2. Digital communication has evolved into an indispensable means of communication and interaction between companies and consumers, witnessing a notable surge in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nIn this year's brand communication cases in the Chinese market, digital communication methods have been widely embraced. This predominantly encompasses digital communication technologies like Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC), programmatic advertising placement, and data analysis tools. These technologies have provided valuable case studies, showcasing the rapid generation of communication content and the real-time optimization of communication forms and content.\n\nDigital information and communication forms can effectively reach a broader audience with diverse preferences, enhancing the brand's impact. Undoubtedly, this will remain a crucial and continually evolving focus for brands.\n\n3. Both Chinese and foreign companies are increasingly emphasizing the establishment of a value identity with users in their communication efforts, with a growing trend towards incorporating traditional Chinese cultural elements.\n\nCompanies are placing a stronger emphasis on establishing a shared value identity with users in their communication strategies. In the Chinese market, there is a noticeable shift away from traditional holiday marketing centered on discounts. Companies are becoming adept at leveraging consumers' emotional connections to traditional festivals to build brand marketing. During festivals such as Chinese New Year, Dragon Boat Festival, and Mid-Autumn Festival, they tap into consumers' memories of these festivals to create warmer holiday marketing strategies, thereby earning greater consumer affection.\n\nAt the same time, many companies are choosing to integrate traditional Chinese cultural elements into their brands. For example, incorporating elements such as the Forbidden City, Cuju (an ancient Chinese football game), Ru kiln porcelain, Tang Sancai pottery, and traditional Chinese colors into product designs has resulted in excellent market feedback.\n\n4. The number of offline events has surged, and organizers are adopting integrated communication strategies to broaden their market reach.\n\nWith the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of offline events has dramatically increased. However, a notable shift has occurred in the traditional events industry, with a departure from purely offline events as seen in the past. Offline events are now integral components of companies' integrated communication strategies, aligning with their objectives to expand into new markets. Traditional event companies are stepping beyond their conventional roles as mere executors of offline events and transforming into integrated communication service providers. They are venturing into the broader field of brand communication to make a more substantial impact and expand market reach.\n\n5. The significance of companies' internal communication has grown, and digital transformation is enhancing communication effectiveness.\n\nInternal communication has become increasingly vital within corporate communication strategies in the Chinese market. This includes cross-cultural internal communication, family day events, leadership enhancement programs, and employee training. At the same time, it is encouraging to observe that more companies are embracing digital transformation, utilizing digital tools such as live streaming, short videos, mini-programs, and internally developed platforms to create internal communication projects, resulting in significant communication outcomes.\n\nThe overall trend in 2023 indicates that the Chinese market has placed more emphasis on brand value, reaching a consensus on establishing a value identity between brand communication and users to boost business and accumulate long-term brand value, ultimately increasing the brand's valuation in the capital market. Each brand's communication case serves this objective.\n\nGolden Flag Award\n\nThe Golden Flag Award was founded in 2010. It is a brand communication award based on the long-term contribution value.\n\nAfter 14 years of development, the Golden Flag Award has become an important yardstick of the performance of brand building in the Chinese market. In 2023, the review standard of the Golden Flag Award received a copyright certificate from the China National Intellectual Property Administration, making it China's first brand communications award with intellectual property rights.\n\nAdhering to the concept of branding upwards, the Golden Flag Award recognizes outstanding cases and brand examples that lead innovation and development in branding, public relations, and marketing. It highlights brand influence and its value for sustainable growth, contributing to public aspirations for cultural and value excellence. The advocacy of branding upwards aims to foster social development.\n\nSince its founding, the Golden Flag Award has attracted numerous Fortune 500 enterprises due to its professionalism and authority.\n\nIn 2018, the awards expanded globally, providing examples and references for global brand PR and marketing professionals to study Chinese brand PR and marketing cases. It also serves as a demonstration of Chinese business civilization from the perspective of commercial communication with the world.\n\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/announcement-of-the-list-of-2023-golden-flag-awards-unveils-five-major-trends-in-communication-strategies-for-the-chinese-market-302020036.html",

        "title": "Announcement of the List of 2023 Golden Flag Awards Unveils Five Major Trends in Communication Strategies for the Chinese Market",
        "body": "BEIJING, Dec. 20, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- According to 17PR reports: the winners of the 2023 Golden Flag Award, the most authoritative and widely recognized brand communication award in China, were officially announced on December 1st, 2023.\n\nThe award-winning cases span diverse fields, such as pharmaceuticals, chemical engineering, finance, e-commerce, aviation, technology, baby care, food, automobiles, agriculture, government, transportation, sports, culture and tourism, entertainment, and cosmetics.\n\nProminent global companies such as Budweiser China, BMW China, JD.com, SAIC-GM, BD, Mars China, Bayer China, Roche's Pharmaceuticals Division, Lundbeck China, DHL, Cargill Investment, KFC China, Corning China, Adidas, McDonald's China, Huawei, Lenovo, Anta, and Volvo have showcased outstanding cases on the list.\n\nThese award-winning cases provide insights into the current communication strategies and trends in the Chinese market, many of which have gained significant traction over the past year.\n\nData from submissions for this year's Golden Flag Award reveals five major trends in brand communication strategies in the Chinese market:\n\n1. Practicing sustainable development has become a must for companies.\n\nThe concept of \"sustainable development\" is highly valued by companies in their communication with Chinese customers. The majority of exemplary cases focus on corporate social responsibility, ESG communication, environmental protection, and public welfare communication. They cover crucial areas of sustainable development, such as rural revitalization, protection of intangible cultural heritage, promotion of knowledge about rare diseases, support for vulnerable groups, and ecological protection and governance.\n\nCompanies of different scales and types are embracing long-termism and actively practicing sustainable development. This not only enhances brand resilience and the ability to guard against risks but also permanently empowers the brand's long-term value.\n\n2. Digital communication has evolved into an indispensable means of communication and interaction between companies and consumers, witnessing a notable surge in the application of artificial intelligence (AI) technology.\n\nIn this year's brand communication cases in the Chinese market, digital communication methods have been widely embraced. This predominantly encompasses digital communication technologies like Artificial Intelligence-Generated Content (AIGC), programmatic advertising placement, and data analysis tools. These technologies have provided valuable case studies, showcasing the rapid generation of communication content and the real-time optimization of communication forms and content.\n\nDigital information and communication forms can effectively reach a broader audience with diverse preferences, enhancing the brand's impact. Undoubtedly, this will remain a crucial and continually evolving focus for brands.\n\n3. Both Chinese and foreign companies are increasingly emphasizing the establishment of a value identity with users in their communication efforts, with a growing trend towards incorporating traditional Chinese cultural elements.\n\nCompanies are placing a stronger emphasis on establishing a shared value identity with users in their communication strategies. In the Chinese market, there is a noticeable shift away from traditional holiday marketing centered on discounts. Companies are becoming adept at leveraging consumers' emotional connections to traditional festivals to build brand marketing. During festivals such as Chinese New Year, Dragon Boat Festival, and Mid-Autumn Festival, they tap into consumers' memories of these festivals to create warmer holiday marketing strategies, thereby earning greater consumer affection.\n\nAt the same time, many companies are choosing to integrate traditional Chinese cultural elements into their brands. For example, incorporating elements such as the Forbidden City, Cuju (an ancient Chinese football game), Ru kiln porcelain, Tang Sancai pottery, and traditional Chinese colors into product designs has resulted in excellent market feedback.\n\n4. The number of offline events has surged, and organizers are adopting integrated communication strategies to broaden their market reach.\n\nWith the end of the COVID-19 pandemic, the number of offline events has dramatically increased. However, a notable shift has occurred in the traditional events industry, with a departure from purely offline events as seen in the past. Offline events are now integral components of companies' integrated communication strategies, aligning with their objectives to expand into new markets. Traditional event companies are stepping beyond their conventional roles as mere executors of offline events and transforming into integrated communication service providers. They are venturing into the broader field of brand communication to make a more substantial impact and expand market reach.\n\n5. The significance of companies' internal communication has grown, and digital transformation is enhancing communication effectiveness.\n\nInternal communication has become increasingly vital within corporate communication strategies in the Chinese market. This includes cross-cultural internal communication, family day events, leadership enhancement programs, and employee training. At the same time, it is encouraging to observe that more companies are embracing digital transformation, utilizing digital tools such as live streaming, short videos, mini-programs, and internally developed platforms to create internal communication projects, resulting in significant communication outcomes.\n\nThe overall trend in 2023 indicates that the Chinese market has placed more emphasis on brand value, reaching a consensus on establishing a value identity between brand communication and users to boost business and accumulate long-term brand value, ultimately increasing the brand's valuation in the capital market. Each brand's communication case serves this objective.\n\nGolden Flag Award\n\nThe Golden Flag Award was founded in 2010. It is a brand communication award based on the long-term contribution value.\n\nAfter 14 years of development, the Golden Flag Award has become an important yardstick of the performance of brand building in the Chinese market. In 2023, the review standard of the Golden Flag Award received a copyright certificate from the China National Intellectual Property Administration, making it China's first brand communications award with intellectual property rights.\n\nAdhering to the concept of branding upwards, the Golden Flag Award recognizes outstanding cases and brand examples that lead innovation and development in branding, public relations, and marketing. It highlights brand influence and its value for sustainable growth, contributing to public aspirations for cultural and value excellence. The advocacy of branding upwards aims to foster social development.\n\nSince its founding, the Golden Flag Award has attracted numerous Fortune 500 enterprises due to its professionalism and authority.\n\nIn 2018, the awards expanded globally, providing examples and references for global brand PR and marketing professionals to study Chinese brand PR and marketing cases. It also serves as a demonstration of Chinese business civilization from the perspective of commercial communication with the world.\n\nView original content to download multimedia:https://www.prnewswire.com/news-releases/announcement-of-the-list-of-2023-golden-flag-awards-unveils-five-major-trends-in-communication-strategies-for-the-chinese-market-302020036.html",

        "title": "In Dialogue: Hint Founder Kara Goldin On Overcoming Doubt And Revolutionizing The Beverage Industry, Part 1",
        "body": "Most often, successful entrepreneurship isn't about creating something entirely new -- it's about identifying an unmet need or area in need of improvement within an existing space and innovating to address it. That's what being a disruptor is about, and it's the kind of progress that has the potential to be profoundly transformative. Just look at the impact generative AI has had across practically every industry over the last few years. Innovators in the space like OpenAI have sparked unprecedented advances in artificial intelligence, fueling a frenzied arms race for the biggest names in tech to stake their claim and leading to what is now dubbed the AI Spring; Microsoft has invested in OpenAI, and Google is trying to rival the platform. Here's the thing though, generative AI isn't entirely new at all, with origins dating back as far as the 1960s.\n\nThat's the power of disruption, and it's a strategy successful entrepreneurs employ in even the most everyday, unassuming of spaces. Just imagine taking that level of innovation and applying it to something as taken for granted yet vital as water. That's exactly what Kara Goldin did when she created Hint, one of the very first unsweetened flavored water brands, the success of which generated a still-growing wave of new flavored water startups and products. Recently, I had the pleasure of speaking with Kara and hearing more about where the inspiration for Hint came from, and how she managed to take an idea that improved her own wellbeing and put it in the hands of millions across the country, all the while transforming the beverage industry in the process.\n\nLiz Elting: Thank you for taking the time to speak with me today. Could you please introduce yourself to the readers and share a little bit about yourself and your career journey?\n\nKara Goldin: I'm the Founder and Former CEO of Hint, the number one unsweetened flavored water. I created and ran Hint for 16 years and remain on the board. Building a whole new category of beverage took a unique approach to product innovation, marketing and sales -- all of which I love. Previously, I was the vice president of Shopping Partnerships at America Online, where I was responsible for helping build the team and all of the shopping partnerships to over a billion dollars in revenue. I've always insisted on working on or creating brands and services that consumers love. I am a creator, a disruptor and I am obsessed with consumers and changing things for them for the better. I host the podcast The Kara Goldin Show and my first book, Undaunted: Overcoming Doubts and Doubters, was released in October 2020 and is now a Wall Street Journal and Amazon bestseller.\n\nElting: The most successful businesses often come from identifying an unmet need and solving it. Was this the case when you founded your company? If so, what did you feel was missing from existing offerings in the beverage industry? How did you approach filling that gap?\n\nGoldin: I created Hint to solve my own addiction to diet soda. After having three kids in four years, I felt like I had no energy, was having trouble losing weight and had skin issues. Eventually I realized that even though diet soda had no calories, I found myself craving sweet foods after each diet drink. I tried switching to plain water for a few weeks and was shocked how much weight I lost, but even with that success, I found myself bored with plain water. So I started infusing fruit into water. That's the idea behind Hint, but it took us three years to reach my goal of creating an unsweetened drink that appealed to most people. The beverage industry thought no one would want unsweetened drinks because the industry was focused on getting people to drink diet drinks as an alternative. We showed the industry that consumers weren't just looking for fewer calories, but wanted better taste without sweeteners at all. Hint led the way in changing the industry for the better, created the category of unsweetened water and still leads the category today.\n\nElting: Building a business from scratch is an immense and risky challenge. The actions a founder takes in the early days -- late nights, tough choices, and unglamorous work -- are make or break. Could you dive into what the early days of starting Hint looked like for you? What actions were most critical to your survival and success?\n\nGoldin: In the very early days of Hint, our week was filled with tons of hands-on work in the field, including selling, taking orders, loading cases into our Jeep, delivering them and stocking shelves around San Francisco and the Bay Area. Our Friday and Saturday \"date nights\" soon turned into weekly strategy sessions with my husband Theo, who I had recruited to be our Chief Operating Officer. As crazy as that sounds, it was fun and productive at the same time. We both knew if we could launch and scale Hint, we could help a lot of consumers enjoy better tasting water and get or stay healthy. As geeky as it sounds, when you have a mission that you believe can help millions of people, the work it takes is compelling and engrossing. We even incorporated sampling into our everyday life, often sampling Hint to parents during our preschool and grade school drop-offs. That strategy not only gave us valuable information about what consumers liked and didn't like, but also created early fans of the brand who still evangelize for Hint today.\n\nElting: One thing I know you applied from your experience in Silicon Valley when founding Hint was creating a stock pool so that every employee has equity in the company. Can you talk about the impact infusing ownership at every level of a company has on the work and culture?\n\nGoldin: We always want to hire people who act like owners and are naturally inclined to do the right thing for the long term success of the brand. Giving equity to everyone sends that message clearly and provides an incentive that lets the whole team share in what they're building. That said, equity alone doesn't make someone act like an owner, but it does incentivize accountability amongst the team -- not just to the brand, but to other team members and oneself as well.\n\nElting: I couldn't agree more -- incentivizing an ownership mentality has always been core to my leadership philosophy as well. On the subject of leadership, you helmed your company through both a recession and the pandemic. Is there anything in particular that stands out that helped you weather those storms? What's your advice to rising and aspiring entrepreneurs on how to get through difficult and unpredictable times?\n\nGoldin: The key is to stay calm, identify the challenges as well as the opportunities, and move quickly to adapt to changes as (or hopefully before) they occur. In the early days of the pandemic, we heard from friends at Google, Facebook and X (formerly Twitter) that they were being sent home, and it seemed likely that mayors in the Bay Area were going to order most businesses to shut down. Theo and I stayed up all night talking through what was coming and what we needed to do to be part of the solution. We were able to reconfigure the business and have a good year despite the pandemic. Key to that was giving clear direction to the team about what we were going to do and why we were going to do it. We also had to be able to explain how our operating procedures aligned with what the public health authorities were recommending.",

        "title": "How To Increase Revenue Using AI In Sales - Real Detroit Weekly",
        "body": "Every businessman makes strategies to grow their business. But, not every strategy works fine. However, Artificial intelligence has proved to be a miraculous technological innovation that has boosted the sales process. In other words, the selling process has transformed thanks to artificial intelligence. One important area where artificial intelligence may be quite helpful is sales. These days, an AI system might suggest to you the right discount rate for a proposal to improve your chances of closing the deal.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) algorithms are used to produce sales leads and determine which of your present clients are most likely to desire a new product offering or an improved version of what they now own. Sales managers can now utilise dashboards to assess which salespeople are likely to hit their targets and which open transactions have a strong chance of closing, all thanks to artificial intelligence. In this article, we'll dive deeper into some AI strategies that you can use to boost sales for your startup.\n\nAccording to Google Analytics, 333.34 million companies use AI worldwide to grow their business. Below, we've come up with amazing ways to help you optimise your sales using AI technology.\n\nWhen buyers make purchases online, they add things to their baskets and receive recommendations for similar items right away. Even though the shoppers didn't know they required such things, they were already adding more to their baskets before realising it.\n\nBy monitoring customers' behaviours and transactions, artificial intelligence enables the system to forecast the products each user wants to purchase. AI carefully monitors its consumers, so it knows what to market. Salespeople invest hours in investigation and questioning to find out what AI is already aware of.\n\nAI should be used to obtain information about a customer's preferences. You can create a compelling pitch using this information even before you meet them in person. Salespeople are aware that a sales pitch has the power to either draw in or turn away clients. AI will enable you to stay one step ahead of your clients' purchases at all times. This type of edge will lead to referrals, which can boost sales and help you establish long-lasting customer connections.\n\nAI provides the ideal means of raising your level of productivity. The programs operate around the clock to bring you qualified leads and new information when the sales crew is sleeping. Who wouldn't want to work around the clock as an employee? Working around the clock is necessary to stay up with the competition because most commercial endeavours are competitive.\n\nYou can increase the overall revenue by automating your business tasks. AI-based auto bots can help you achieve greater profitability in a very short time. Even your trading tasks can be completed automatically with the help of a robot assistant like Quantum AI. They are based on advanced AI algorithms and can execute complex trading tasks.\n\nEven if the AI software can't find you new customers or make transactions, it's comforting to know that your goals are set and you only need to aim. Reducing the amount of time spent sorting through massive amounts of data allows for more time to be spent on sales.\n\nVirtual assistants with voice control are a common feature of AI systems, and they may capture information for your reps from any device. In addition, they initiate dialogues with your representatives and pose pertinent inquiries to ensure accurate data interpretation. Fortunately, salesmen enjoy having conversations far more than entering data.\n\nYou can evaluate purchasing trends using AI systems, which can predict client demands. Companies like Amazon successfully balance gaining new clients while also providing excellent customer care for their current clientele. Think about how wonderful it would be to be notified each time a customer runs low on a certain product. Better yet, what if you could obtain precise recommendations on which product to try cross-selling to which customer? The possibility of you determining the customer's desires while you're just speculating may be low. With AI technology, however, success is virtually a given.\n\nThough it's undoubtedly one of the most popular phrases in sales today, personalization is more than simply a trend. The fact is that customization works; as a result, generic sales and marketing messages are losing their effectiveness as consumers now demand a tailored experience. More than 90% of customers assert that they are inclined to purchase from companies that acknowledge them and make pertinent offers. Naturally, AI is not required for customisation, but it may undoubtedly assist in providing each consumer with a more distinctive experience.\n\nThese machine-learning algorithms examine a variety of data, such as browsing patterns, previous contacts with consumers, past transactions, and purchases made by other customers who exhibit similar traits or behaviours. Rather than offering a broader range of products that are relatively similar to those that were previously bought, this data is automatically used to suggest things that are very likely to be of interest to each individual user.\n\nHuman sales talents are still superior to those of machines. Their proficiency is in handling large amounts of data processing. This indicates that using AI technologies to identify trends and patterns in consumer data is a very effective use case. It can score leads automatically in a way that is less arbitrary and more accurate than manual scoring.\n\nSales teams may focus on their most valued prospects using AI lead scoring while sending less-qualified leads back to the marketing team for more nurturing via the sales funnel.\n\nSales and marketing teams may spend more time engaging with prospects and creating successful marketing campaigns by utilising sales software that scores leads based on predictive analytics. It is no longer necessary to use priceless staff resources on data analysis, manual lead scoring and prospect identification.\n\nAI can estimate the cross-sells and upsells that a sales team would most likely be successful with for each lead, in addition to identifying those prospects who are most likely to convert. Machine learning algorithms can forecast which goods and services will appeal to each lead the most by analysing data from prior exchanges with the lead and prior sales with other clients. This removes the need for sales teams to make educated guesses about cross-selling and lowers the possibility of upsetting current clients by aggressively promoting goods and services they don't want to buy.\n\nAI has enormous promise in sales. Nevertheless, there's no one right approach to integrating this technology into your sales procedures. It is a good idea to start analysing the parts of your sales process that you want to make simpler and more efficient. You may use this to select the best AI sales tool for your team as well.",

        "body": "The world of artificial intelligence (AI) witnessed a torrent of speculative buzz on Wednesday as the U.S. embarked on its journey to regulate generative AI. U.S. President Joe Biden, with his administration, appears to be setting sights on developing critical standards for the safe deployment of generative AI within the nation.\n\nMoreover, the Commerce Department's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) further weighed in on the matter, cracking on ensuring the safety of AI systems. Succeeding Europe's recent stance on AI regulation, the U.S. now further embarks on its venture to revolutionize AI, as portrayed by the efforts poured in by Biden's administration.\n\nAccording to Commerce Secretary Gina Raimondo, Biden's October executive order on AI initially ushered in the endeavor to safely regulate AI within the nation. Moreover, following Biden's initial order, the current endeavor zeroes in on setting benchmarks for AI safety, security, and trust within the U.S. With this, the administration eyes global leadership in the conscientious advancement and utilization of this rapidly evolving technology.\n\nMeanwhile, as the NIST chimed in, it sought public and industry opinions on AI regulation by February 2, 2024. With this, the commerce institute aims to administer significant testing on AI-related systems to ensure the safety of the entire AI industry on the nation's horizon.\n\nFurthermore, the agency reportedly appears to be setting its sights on fostering guidelines for evaluating AI and developing standards orbiting AI systems. Notably, Biden's order asserted agencies to customize standards for testing AI encompassing cybersecurity, nuclear, and radiological risks, among many others.\n\nWith this chronicle, the U.S. now appears to be the second major powerhouse, following the EU's AI chronicle in recent days.\n\nAlso read: Here's Why The Crypto Market Is Witnessing Volatile Trading, What's Next For BTC?\n\nAlthough the U.S. made it pretty clear that the need to regulate AI remains of utmost importance, powerhouses like EU seem to be a step ahead. Notably, Biden's initial stance on handling AI came forth in October earlier this year. However, the current stance appears to be of greater importance.\n\nMeanwhile, the EU reached a provisional deal for regulating AI earlier this month, leading the race. Additionally, India followed behind as it intensified its focus on AI with the GPAI Summit.",

        "title": "26 Best Stock Market Books of All Time [2024 Edition]",
        "body": "The best stock market books of all time are The Little Book that Still Beats the Market, A Man for All Markets, How to Make Money in Stocks, Dark Pools, Technical Analysis of the Financial Markets, and The Intelligent Investor.\n\nAs a certified market analyst and 20-year veteran investor, I can guarantee these are the best stock investing books to read to expand your knowledge. I should know I have read them all.\n\nHere, you will find a hand-picked selection of the best finance and investing books ever written, including a detailed review and ratings based on the books' content, practicality, and readability.\n\nThe Little Book that Still Beats the Market is the best stock market book for long-term stock investors because it lays out a proven and tested strategy for solid stock market returns year after year.\n\nThe Little Book that Still Beats the Market is a guide to investing written by Joel Greenblatt. The book is divided into two parts: the first deals with how to make money in the stock market, and the second is a case study of how Greenblatt's investment firm made over 30% annual returns for 20 years.\n\nThe book's first part discusses value investing, special situations, and momentum investing. Greenblatt argues that these are the best strategies for making money in the stock market and provides detailed explanations of how each one works. He also includes several case studies to illustrate his points.\n\nThe book's second part is a detailed account of how Greenblatt's investment firm achieved such high returns. He discusses the firm's investment philosophy, stock selection process, and risk management strategies. He also provides a list of recommended readings for further study.\n\nIt is a short but fascinating book looking at a specific system that the author declares and proves makes a regular profit.\n\nGreenblatt's strategy is called the Magic Formula, which is based on two specific formulas: the Greenblatt ROC and the Greenblatt Earnings Yield.\n\nI have backtested this system personally, and it works very well; it is a little high maintenance, but the lessons contained within the book are vital. It is also quite humorous, which is welcome in the dry world of investing -- a great introduction to a stock market system from an investing legend.\n\nTip: If you want to implement the Magic Formula Strategy easily, it is included in Stock Rover's Screening & Research Software (Visit Stock Rover for their Premium Plus Service)\n\nThe Little Book that Still Beats the Market is the best stock investing book because it lays out a proven and tested strategy for solid stock market returns year after year.\n\nA Man for All Markets is a compelling autobiography of renowned mathematician, investor, and gambler Edward O. Thorp. It chronicles his extraordinary life journey from childhood to adulthood as he navigates with remarkable success through some of the most complex financial markets worldwide. Aptly titled, this book shows how Thorp has invested in numerous stocks, bonds, and other financial assets while still having an edge over the competition.\n\nThe book starts with Thorp discussing his early education at MIT and Princeton. He introduces us to key concepts like probability theory, game theory, and mathematical analysis, allowing him to identify exploitable patterns in everything from stock market trends to blackjack strategies. After learning these principles, he began to apply them to the stock markets, eventually launching a highly successful hedge fund in 1969.\n\nThroughout the book, Thorp shares his insights on risk management, market behavior, and investment strategies that have enabled him to defy the odds time and time again. He also details some of his more notable successes, such as cashing out of the British Pound market before Black Wednesday or beating the house in Las Vegas casinos. Thorp's story is inspiring, showing that with the right knowledge and a bit of risk-taking, it is possible to make money in any market.\n\nHow to Make Money in Stocks is the best investing book for growth stocks because it provides a wealth of knowledge and insights into the core fundamentals of growth investing.\n\n\"How to Make Money in Stocks\" by William O'Neil teaches readers how to make money in the stock market. The book is divided into four sections: understanding stocks, buying stocks, selling stocks, and protecting your profits. O'Neil provides readers with a wealth of information on investing in stocks, including finding profitable opportunities and avoiding costly mistakes.\n\nHe also includes examples of real-world investments to illustrate his points. \"How to Make Money in Stocks\" is a comprehensive guide to stock market investing that will help readers succeed in the stock market.\n\nThis best-selling book combines technical and fundamental analysis and provides an excellent framework for building your stock market investing approach.\n\nThey are packed full of clear examples and a very structured approach. The CANSLIM approach is easily remembered as a stock screening approach to finding good stocks and shares to invest in.\n\nThese ideas are integrated into our Pro training course and improved upon in our Beat the Market Strategy.\n\nThe book heavily promotes using Investors.com as a tool. In reality, you do not need to purchase this service, as you can create your own stock screeners to achieve the same goal for free.\n\nLiberated Stock Trader, A Complete Stock Market Education is perfect for beginner investors because the book is accompanied by 16 hours of in-depth stock investing video lessons, which help build a complete picture of how the stock market functions.\n\nDesigned as a complete education, the book covers everything you need to know to start investing in stocks. Fundamental analysis, technical analysis, stock screening, risk management, and psychology are all covered.\n\nInvesting in stocks means mastering fundamental financial analysis, the foundation for profitable long-term growth, dividend, and value investing strategies.\n\nIt would be best to learn stock screening to find great companies and build a balanced portfolio to grow wealth.\n\nWhat makes it different is that 16 hours of instructor-led lead video are included, which turns this training from a book to a full stock market seminar training.\n\nPremium stock market education is expensive; this training course is extremely cost-effective -- well-rounded education for those who want to take the stock market seriously.\n\nThe best book for day traders is Dark Pools because it enables you to understand you cannot compete with the machines. Machines make 80% of stock trades; how can you compete?

Some of the \"lies\" are difficult to agree with, but on the whole, they are a good insight into the views of Wall Street and the government.\n\nPositives: Although Talbott tells you what all the lies are, his versions of the truth are also debatable. A firm view against using technical analysis to analyze stocks and the market shows he is no expert in this area. However, these flaws in his reasoning are balanced with good and compelling arguments against many of the preconceptions we have today regarding governments, corporations, venture capital, and economics\".\n\nNegatives: Some interesting arguments, especially if you have a left-wing conspiracy theory bent.

        "title": "Stable Diffusion XL: The New Model From Stable AI - DZone",
        "body": "Among the outstanding advances in image generation through artificial intelligence is Stable Diffusion, a powerful tool that has revolutionized the creation of visual content. Stability AI aims to maintain its leading position in generating images from text with the recent release of its Stable Diffusion XL 1.0 image generator. 'XL' refers to the fact that it has been trained with almost three times more parameters than its previous models.\n\nToday we will talk about this new model and what improvements it brings and also explore the interactive system in image generation using artificial intelligence, thus introducing the revolutionary Stable Diffusion XL Turbo.\n\nStable Diffusion XL (SDXL) is positioned as a remarkable innovation with significant improvements in several aspects, marking a substantial advance over its predecessors.\n\nThe impressive increase in the number of parameters, reaching 2.3 billion, stands out as a crucial milestone. This expansion translates into a more powerful learning process and improved overall performance for the model.\n\nThis increase in capability is reflected in the hyper-realism that characterizes SDXL-generated images. Surpassing previous versions in detail and quality, the resulting images are distinguished by their stunning authenticity.\n\nAnother key aspect of the enhancement is evidenced by SDXL's improved ability to generate realistic and consistent human faces. Improvements in facial features and expressions contribute to the creation of more convincing and vivid portraits.\n\nIn the area of image compositing, Stable Diffusion XL demonstrates an enhanced ability to create more compelling and convincing visual scenes. Optimized image compositing results in a more immersive and captivating visual experience.\n\nHighlighting text readability, Stable Diffusion XL outperforms its predecessors by exhibiting superior efficiency in generating readable text within images. This advancement is especially valuable in applications such as creating advertisements or illustrations that effectively incorporate textual content.\n\nSDXL's image-to-image prompting functionality adds an additional layer of versatility to the model, going beyond the conventional text-to-image approach. The ability to generate variations of an image based on another image stands out as a distinctive element.\n\nIn addition, Stable Diffusion XL introduces inpainting and outpainting capabilities, allowing the reconstruction of missing sections in an image (inpainting) and the coherent extension of existing images (outpainting). These functions significantly expand the creative possibilities and applications of the model.\n\nTogether, these enhancements consolidate SDXL as a more robust and versatile model, broadening its potential impact in diverse industries and creative scenarios.\n\nTo use this new model for free up to a certain limit, we have the option to use it in DreamStudio. You can access from this link.\n\nTo start, we will register with the button that appears at the top right with the text Login, and that will allow us to do it with Google.\n\nThen, all we have to do is type in the prompt for what we want Stable Diffusion to generate for us and click on the Dream button below.\n\nAs you can see, I have also put \"people\" where it says Negative Prompt. This means that I don't want people to appear in my image. I have also chosen a Pixel Art style, but there are quite a few more, in case you want to try some more interesting ones.\n\nStable Diffusion XL Turbo (SDXL Turbo) redefines imaging through artificial intelligence by instantly generating visual content based on text, descriptions, or prompts. This innovative model is characterized by its ability to produce images while the user is writing instructions, thanks to advanced Adversarial Diffusion Distillation (ADD) technology.\n\nThis advance represents a significant transformation compared to its predecessor, drastically reducing the time required for image creation. ADD technology allows the process to be completed in a single step, eliminating the need for the 20 to 50 steps that characterized the previous model and extending the processing of each image by several seconds.\n\nAlthough the resulting images do not reach the same level of detail as those produced by the previous method with more steps, the speed improvement is palpable, providing visually stunning results. In tests, SDXL Turbo demonstrated the ability to generate a 1024×1024 image in approximately 4 seconds, underscoring its outstanding efficiency.\n\nTo use it, we will only have to go to this link and register as we did in DreamStudio's web previously.\n\nOnce this is done, the text box will appear with which we can interact and see how our image is drawn as we write our prompt. Here is my result:\n\nAs you can see, I have been varying my prompt little by little, adding new ideas, and finally, I have tried to twist it and change the main character.\n\nIn the fascinating landscape of artificial intelligence, the evolution of models such as Stable Diffusion and its latest incarnation, SDXL 1.0, stands out as a tangible testament to the remarkable advances in image generation. These powerful tools, developed by Stability AI, have not only transformed visual content creation but have also set new standards in terms of capability and efficiency.\n\nThe introduction of SDXL 1.0, with its impressive training based on 2.3 billion parameters, demonstrates the continued dedication to innovation and the pursuit of excellence. This model, with the designation 'XL,' overcomes previous limitations by significantly expanding its processing power, thus marking a significant milestone in the evolution of text-based imaging.\n\nIn addition, the revolutionary addition of Stable Diffusion XL Turbo takes the experience to new levels by enabling near real-time generation of images. This exceptional capability not only speeds up the creation process but also opens the door to exciting possibilities, such as special effects in video games and customized themes for individual users. The speed with which SDXL Turbo can create visual content offers unprecedented potential for the entertainment industry and digital creativity.\n\nHowever, it is important to note that while these advances are remarkable, they still fall short of Midjourney, especially in terms of the realism that Midjourney achieves. Midjourney continues to be a benchmark in image generation, standing out for its ability to create stunningly realistic visual worlds that, so far, remain unmatched.",

        "title": "GUEST COLUMN: Honor those who protected,  defended the Constitution",
        "body": "What is the duty of every United States citizen? We live in a country with one of the most powerful documents ever created safeguarding the rights of every citizen. This is a country that has spilled blood in defense of the Constitution. Unfortunately in too many homes, schools, churches, businesses and news organizations, we spend more time talking about social media, pop culture icons, the newest tech, pro sports, and how much vacation time we can take next year then about the crimson-stained fabric of history that affords us the indulgent luxury of worrying more about an introductory rate on our latest credit card than the cost of freedom.\n\nIn the race towards what we call enlightenment, on a road paved with good intentions, we are sacrificing freedoms once carefully enshrined in the Constitution for short-sighted gains.\n\nInstead of blatantly compromising the freedom of the press, we now rely on artificial intelligence to spoon-feed us information. Instead of protecting the freedom of speech, we are subject to bot farms of foreign powers persuading us with clever memes; creating artificial labels for those we disagree with and disintegrating what would have historically been a rational conversation about different ideas into a fragmented stew of vitriol. Instead of understanding the historic merit of a \"well armed militia,\" we demonize the very word \"militia\" to make it equal to misguided nationalism and jingoism of the worst kind.\n\nIn a country built on the foundation of due process and a legal system that was partially rooted in avoiding things like Europe's debtors prisons of the 1700s, we're now in a society that is carrying more personal debt than ever and a government that cannot stop spending money we literally do not possess. This is a partial and extraordinarily incomplete list of what is wrong.\n\nWhat is right?\n\nWhat is right ... is that we remember Pfc. Charles \"Charley\" Havlat, Col. William Benedict Nolde, Pvt. Kenneth Shadrick, Staff Sgt. Ahmed K. Altaie, and Marine Corps Lance Cpl. Kareem Nikoui. These are the last members of the U.S. military who died in World War II, the Korean War, the war in Iraq, and the war in Afghanistan. Did they die for an idea? Their country? Their unit and their friend next to them? They each have a story, an imperfect story, but uniquely theirs nonetheless and in no way can it be recounted properly with a few short words.\n\nSign up for free: Gazette Opinion Receive updates from our editorial staff, guest columnists, and letters from Gazette readers.

View all of our newsletters.\n\nWhat can be known, what is known, is that they died in service to this nation. Kareem, who was 20 years old when he was killed in action, will never laugh again with friends at dinner. He will never get to say \"Merry Christmas\" to his Mom, to his Dad, to his brothers and sisters. He will never be a Dad. He will never be married. He will not vote. And he will not get to raise his voice in support or in opposition for a candidate or an idea that he is passionate about.\n\nMaybe Charley's legacy, Bill's family, Ken's memory, Ahmed's voice, and Kareem's honor can be preserved and properly valued. Through action and a deliberate choice, citizens of the United States can choose to honor the blood that preserves, protects, and defends the Constitution from all enemies, foreign and domestic. How? By choosing to vote. When? By choosing now to be a patriot who unabashedly proclaims the virtue of a constitutional republic. Who? By choosing to be the best version of a father. The best version of a mother. The best version of a citizen those men embody; that is how we honor their memory and let their voices be heard beyond the constraints of time.\n\nIt is not enough to wake up every day and be content with the daily trifles and baubles that amuse us. Our duty is to be more and to do more. In the bustle of a Christmas season and on the brink of the New Year, perspective is critical. It's not that everyday struggles are not real or that -- for many -- making ends meet is a battle between which bills to pay each month. It's not even that enjoying the miracles of the latest technology or reveling in your hometown sports team is a waste of time. Rather, the \"mundane\" activities should be appreciated in the correct context.\n\nThe context is one of freedom. Freedom safeguarded by a historic document and bought with great sacrifice. We should enjoy and take great delight when our sons and daughters open their gifts on Christmas morning.\n\nIf we are wise, we will also be intentional about educating ourselves and our family about what it means to have the freedom to do so. Whether we are talking about the memory of Charley or Kareem, I am pretty sure that is what they would want.\n\nNathan Fisk owns a successful residential real estate team, is a principal in a land development firm, and was previously an executive consultant for small and midsized companies in Colorado.

        "body": "Eric Heliene, head of buy-side trading desk, Groupama Asset Management\n\nIn the buy-side trading world, technological innovation is a perpetual driver of transformation, and large language models (LLMs) are emerging as key players in this ongoing evolution. These models, with their ability to analyse vast volumes of unstructured data, are opening new perspectives for understanding market dynamics. The extraction of sentiment and trend indicators from diverse sources - financial news, expert analyses, discussion forums - could revolutionise how buy-side trading desks approach investment decisions.\n\nThese real-time insights allow for quicker reactivity and adaptation to market fluctuations, providing a valuable competitive edge. Furthermore, LLMs promise to transform the execution of trading orders. By anticipating and assessing the potential market impact, these models could optimise timing and pricing strategies, thus minimising costs and maximising transaction efficiency. This ability to dynamically adapt to ever-changing market conditions signifies a significant step forward towards more strategic and thoughtful trading management. Next year could witness this revolution, where LLMs are no longer just analytical tools, but integral strategic partners in the buy-side trading world.\n\nSylvain Thieullent, chief executive officer, Horizon\n\nThe world of trading has become increasingly automated, relying on quantitative analysis, predictive models, and advanced algos to increase both speed and efficiency. It is without question AI is going to continue to dominate headlines in 2024. The data required to meaningfully apply AI is becoming cleaner, and the technology tools smarter, and I'd argue this marks the beginning of a completely new way to trade.\n\nOne of the use-cases set to take off next year is around liquidity management, utilising AI-based tools to seek out market inefficiencies and generate more profitable trading opportunities. Recognising when the market's liquidity is changing is essential for traders, investors, and financial institutions, and AI can be used to enhance the way in which we identify these fluctuations. Applying this to trading strategies, market participants will have an even more optimised way of executing orders for their clients.\n\nLisa Schirf, global head of data and analytics, Tradeweb\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) being front-of-mind for next year is no surprise, but it does continue to present significant opportunities in applying data science to develop more transparent, intelligent and efficient ways to trade. AI models are useful in looking at historical information and estimating what could happen in the future based on a set of parameters. It can synthesise all of the information that goes into an optimised execution decision by helping to predict the best possible parameters, such as timing, dealers chosen and number of dealers selected, based on a set of given requirements. We expect to see the technology increase low-touch trading, with trades being executed without human intervention. We're also looking at the technology's capabilities in liquidity predictions.\n\nWe expect the use-cases in electronic trading to only keep on growing next year, particularly in the management of this proliferation of available data we're seeing, from solutions for predictive prices for dealer selection and count, to different trading protocols, to handling less liquid securities. As we see the demand from the market increase, we're already building model-based prices with advanced AI techniques that allow us to predict the price of a security based off of public and Tradeweb proprietary data sources. For municipal bonds, this means leveraging proprietary data science to calculate both intraday and end-of-day prices for these bonds.",

        "title": "The Smartest Investors Are Buying These 2 Stocks Hand Over Fist | The Motley Fool",
        "body": "These companies dominate their respective industries and will likely deliver significant gains long into the future.\n\nThe new year is right around the corner and now is an excellent time to invest in companies likely to soar over the next 12 months and beyond. Some of the best options have strong penetration in the consumer market and expanding positions in high-growth industries. These characteristics can almost guarantee significant financial gains over the long term and deliver reliable stock growth.\n\nTwo companies that easily fit this criteria are Amazon (AMZN -0.18%) and Apple (AAPL 0.54%). These tech giants have proven brand loyalty with consumers and are dominating their respective markets.\n\nShares in Amazon and Apple have risen about 81% and 50% year to date but could have plenty of room left to run thanks to significant cash reserves and positions in developing sectors like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nSo, here are two stocks that the smartest investors are buying hand over fist.\n\nIt's easy to be bullish about Amazon. The company is the biggest name in e-commerce in dozens of countries, leading a market worth more than $3 trillion and expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 10% through 2028. Its dependence on retail sales made it vulnerable to macroeconomic headwinds last year as reductions in consumer spending caused steep declines in its e-commerce segments.\n\nHowever, the company posted revenue growth of 13% year over year in the third quarter of 2023, beating Wall Street forecasts by $1.5 billion after an impressive retail turnaround. Amazon's North American division topped $4 billion in operating income, massively improving on the $412 million loss it reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe solid recovery in Amazon's e-commerce business proves the value of its stock as a long-term buy, with management able to successfully navigate market headwinds. Cost-cutting measures such as warehouse closures, shuttering unprofitable projects, and layoffs put the company on stronger financial footing heading into 2024 and long into the future.\n\nIn addition to a powerful position in e-commerce, Amazon is home to the world's biggest cloud platform with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Demand for AI cloud tools soared this year as businesses everywhere are increasingly seeking ways to boost productivity with the technology. Meanwhile, AWS introduced a diverse range of AI services catering to different professionals, from software developers to healthcare providers.\n\nAWS accounts for 16% of Amazon's revenue yet is responsible for the biggest portion of operating income. The highly profitable business is one of the best reasons to invest in Amazon's stock, with earnings likely to continue rising alongside AI and cloud developments.\n\nThis chart shows Amazon has the lowest price-to-sales ratio of the three biggest cloud companies, suggesting the retail giant's stock offers the best value. The company's stock is a screaming buy right now and you can confidently buy it hand over fist.\n\nAs the world's most valuable company with a market cap above $3 trillion, Apple is probably already on your radar for a potential investment. The chart below shows the company's stock has skyrocketed 378% over the last five years, outperforming many of its biggest competitors. While past gains are not always indicative of what's to come, even if Apple delivered half that growth over the next five years, it would still provide more growth than Alphabet, Meta, or Amazon has since 2018.\n\nApple's history of reliability has caught the eye of some of the world's most successful investors, with Warren Buffett famously a huge proponent of the company. Apple accounts for 48% of Berkshire Hathaway's (Buffett's holding company) portfolio, delivering stock growth of 645% since the firm first bought shares in 2016.\n\nBuffett has often spoken of Apple's powerful brand loyalty among consumers. The tech giant's walled garden of products encourages users to stay within its ecosystem, as advanced connectivity promotes ease of use. Apple's winning product strategy enabled it to achieve leading market shares in smartphones, headphones, tablets, and smartwatches.\n\nMoreover, digital services such as Apple TV+, Music, and iCloud allow the company to continue making money from its devices for years after they are initially purchased.\n\nApple has had a challenging 2023, with revenue dipping 3% year over year as it faced an economic downturn. However, the company ended the fiscal year with nearly $100 billion in free cash flow, indicating it has the funds to overcome current headwinds and continue investing in its business.\n\nApple's valuation is slightly high, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 30. However, the popularity of its products and considerable cash reserves likely means it's earned its expensive price tag, with Apple stock a no-brainer buy for long-term-minded investors.",

        "body": "This five-year winner's prospects point toward a repeat of solid gains over the next half-decade.\n\nAn investment of just $100 made in shares of Nvidia (NVDA -0.95%) five years ago is now worth about $1,339, which is not surprising as the market has rewarded the chipmaker's impressive growth in revenue and earnings handsomely.\n\nA big chunk of those gains came in 2023, driven by a significant acceleration in Nvidia's growth thanks to the company's dominant position in the market for artificial intelligence (AI) chips and the recent recovery in the personal computer (PC) market, which kick-started the growth of its gaming business.\n\nEven better is that analysts forecast Nvidia will grow at a much faster pace in the next five years compared to the growth it has clocked in the previous half-decade. More specifically, consensus estimates forecast Nvidia's earnings to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 103% over the next five years. That would be more than double the 48% CAGR Nvidia's bottom line has clocked in the past five years.\n\nA closer look at Nvidia's key growth drivers will tell us exactly why its bottom-line growth is expected to step on the gas over the next five years.\n\nNvidia was a much smaller company five years ago. It generated just under $12 billion in revenue in fiscal 2019 (which ended in January 2019 and coincided with 11 months of calendar year 2018). Gaming was Nvidia's biggest business segment at that time, accounting for 53% of its top line, while the data center business produced a quarter of its total revenue five years ago.\n\nThe situation has changed dramatically since then. The company now gets 80% of its revenue from selling graphics processing units (GPU) for the data center market. Gaming is now a smaller component, with just under 16% of Nvidia's fiscal 2024 third-quarter revenue. Still, Nvidia is the leader in both of these markets.\n\nAccording to third-party estimates, Nvidia controls more than 80% of the AI chip market, and it has a similar position in the market for discrete graphics cards that are deployed in PCs. The good news is that both of these markets are built for solid growth over the next five years. According to Nvidia's peer Advanced Micro Devices, the AI chip market could generate annual revenue of $400 billion in 2027, up nearly 10x from this year's $45 billion.\n\nOn the other hand, the gaming GPU market is forecast to grow at an annual pace of almost 34% through the end of 2028, according to Mordor Intelligence. The cloud gaming market, which is forecast to clock annual growth of 39% through 2028 and generate annual revenue of $23 billion at the end of the forecast period, could be another catalyst for Nvidia given the company's dominant position in this space.\n\nMore importantly, Nvidia has been taking steps to ensure that it remains the leading player in these markets by way of its product development moves. The company has already accelerated its product roadmap in AI chips, and it is reportedly going to make its next-generation gaming cards on a more advanced 3-nanometer (nm) process as compared to the current RTX 40-series processors that are made on a 5nm process.\n\nA smaller manufacturing node should ideally allow Nvidia's new gaming chips to pack more computing power and consume less electricity at the same time. This explains why Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, from whom Nvidia sources its chips, claims that the 3nm chips could boost performance by 15% and lower power consumption by 30% as compared to the 5nm chips.\n\nAll this indicates that Nvidia is setting itself up to make the most of the impressive growth in the key end markets that contribute significantly to its business. That's why it won't be surprising to see the company's earnings indeed growing at a much faster pace over the next five years as compared to the past five.\n\nNvidia is on track to finish fiscal 2024 with revenue of $59 billion. That translates into a five-year revenue CAGR of 38% using the company's fiscal 2019 revenue of $11.7 billion as the base. For comparison, Nvidia's revenue growth is expected to be much faster over the next couple of years, as the following chart indicates.\n\nThe company is expected to generate almost $108 billion in revenue in fiscal 2026. That points toward a three-year revenue CAGR of 58% using the fiscal 2023 revenue of $27 billion as the base. If we assume that Nvidia's annual growth slows down to even 30% in the three fiscal years following fiscal 2026, its top line could hit $237 billion in fiscal 2029.\n\nNvidia has a five-year price-to-sales ratio of 20. Multiplying that with the company's projected revenue in fiscal 2029 would translate to a market cap of $4.75 trillion. That's nearly 4x of Nvidia's current market cap, indicating that a $100 investment in this hot tech stock could multiply once again in the next five years and make investors richer.",

        "title": "The Smartest Investors Are Buying These 2 Stocks Hand Over Fist",
        "body": "The new year is right around the corner and now is an excellent time to invest in companies likely to soar over the next 12 months and beyond. Some of the best options have strong penetration in the consumer market and expanding positions in high-growth industries. These characteristics can almost guarantee significant financial gains over the long term and deliver reliable stock growth.\n\nTwo companies that easily fit this criteria are Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) and Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL). These tech giants have proven brand loyalty with consumers and are dominating their respective markets.\n\nShares in Amazon and Apple have risen about 81% and 50% year to date but could have plenty of room left to run thanks to significant cash reserves and positions in developing sectors like artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nSo, here are two stocks that the smartest investors are buying hand over fist.\n\n1. Amazon\n\nIt's easy to be bullish about Amazon. The company is the biggest name in e-commerce in dozens of countries, leading a market worth more than $3 trillion and expected to expand at a compound annual growth rate of 10% through 2028. Its dependence on retail sales made it vulnerable to macroeconomic headwinds last year as reductions in consumer spending caused steep declines in its e-commerce segments.\n\nHowever, the company posted revenue growth of 13% year over year in the third quarter of 2023, beating Wall Street forecasts by $1.5 billion after an impressive retail turnaround. Amazon's North American division topped $4 billion in operating income, massively improving on the $412 million loss it reported in the year-ago quarter.\n\nThe solid recovery in Amazon's e-commerce business proves the value of its stock as a long-term buy, with management able to successfully navigate market headwinds. Cost-cutting measures such as warehouse closures, shuttering unprofitable projects, and layoffs put the company on stronger financial footing heading into 2024 and long into the future.\n\nIn addition to a powerful position in e-commerce, Amazon is home to the world's biggest cloud platform with Amazon Web Services (AWS). Demand for AI cloud tools soared this year as businesses everywhere are increasingly seeking ways to boost productivity with the technology. Meanwhile, AWS introduced a diverse range of AI services catering to different professionals, from software developers to healthcare providers.\n\nAWS accounts for 16% of Amazon's revenue yet is responsible for the biggest portion of operating income. The highly profitable business is one of the best reasons to invest in Amazon's stock, with earnings likely to continue rising alongside AI and cloud developments.\n\nThis chart shows Amazon has the lowest price-to-sales ratio of the three biggest cloud companies, suggesting the retail giant's stock offers the best value. The company's stock is a screaming buy right now and you can confidently buy it hand over fist.\n\n2. Apple\n\nAs the world's most valuable company with a market cap above $3 trillion, Apple is probably already on your radar for a potential investment. The chart below shows the company's stock has skyrocketed 378% over the last five years, outperforming many of its biggest competitors. While past gains are not always indicative of what's to come, even if Apple delivered half that growth over the next five years, it would still provide more growth than Alphabet, Meta, or Amazon has since 2018.\n\nApple's history of reliability has caught the eye of some of the world's most successful investors, with Warren Buffett famously a huge proponent of the company. Apple accounts for 48% of Berkshire Hathaway's (Buffett's holding company) portfolio, delivering stock growth of 645% since the firm first bought shares in 2016.\n\nBuffett has often spoken of Apple's powerful brand loyalty among consumers. The tech giant's walled garden of products encourages users to stay within its ecosystem, as advanced connectivity promotes ease of use. Apple's winning product strategy enabled it to achieve leading market shares in smartphones, headphones, tablets, and smartwatches.\n\nMoreover, digital services such as Apple TV+, Music, and iCloud allow the company to continue making money from its devices for years after they are initially purchased.\n\nApple has had a challenging 2023, with revenue dipping 3% year over year as it faced an economic downturn. However, the company ended the fiscal year with nearly $100 billion in free cash flow, indicating it has the funds to overcome current headwinds and continue investing in its business.\n\nApple's valuation is slightly high, with a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 30. However, the popularity of its products and considerable cash reserves likely means it's earned its expensive price tag, with Apple stock a no-brainer buy for long-term-minded investors.\n\nWhere to invest $1,000 right now\n\nWhen our analyst team has a stock tip, it can pay to listen. After all, the newsletter they have run for two decades, Motley Fool Stock Advisor, has more than tripled the market.*\n\nThey just revealed what they believe are the ten best stocks for investors to buy right now... and Amazon made the list -- but there are 9 other stocks you may be overlooking.\n\nSuzanne Frey, an executive at Alphabet, is a member of The Motley Fool's board of directors.

        "title": "LoopMe Secures Two Patents for its AI-Powered Intelligent Marketplace",
        "body": "New patents validate LoopMe's AI leadership while protecting company technology that powers marketplace bid price optimization and real-time bidding in advertising auctions\n\nLoopMe, a leading technology company that uses artificial intelligence (AI) to improve brand advertising performance announced that it has been granted two patents for the novel technology enabling its Intelligent Marketplace for buyers and sellers. The first patent, \"Automated Hybrid, Optimized Advertising Auction System and Method,\" is for LoopMe's innovative approach to advertising auction bid floor and bid value optimization in real-time, a method that is outperforming human operators and other systems in operation. The patent has been validated against state of the art research by big tech and major universities at AdKDD, one of the biggest global machine learning conferences, along with receiving the best paper award at the event.\n\nRead 10 AI In Manufacturing Trends To Look Out For In 2024\n\n\"Less than a half of patent applications pass the scrutiny of the U.S. patent office - so having two new patents granted is a big win for LoopMe\"\n\n\"Our newest patent increases market efficiency by automatically setting real-time auction parameters - a significant advancement for the programmatic advertising ecosystem,\" said Dr. Leonard Newnham, Chief Data Scientist at LoopMe. \"Correctly setting the bid floor results in fewer wasted bids and fewer requests being sent by DSPs. Since a large DSP can receive many billions of requests per day, the reduction of costs can be substantial.\"\n\nIn real-time advertising auctions, correctly setting the bid floor, which is the lowest bid a bidder can make, is important as it communicates the minimum price to have a reasonable chance of getting an advertiser's ad placed on a mobile device. If the bid floor is set too low, bidding becomes inefficient as it encourages low bids that have no chance of winning. The systems are continuously updating over 1 million parameters to dynamically and rapidly respond to changing market conditions and behaviors, far outperforming any human.\n\nThe second patent, \"Real-time Bidding,\" was granted to LoopMe for the unique capability of setting an optimal bid price for each individual ad request in real-time auctions. This feature enhances efficiency and allows LoopMe to safely and accurately outbid competitor bids to the publisher, which ultimately increases the win rate. This means more of the DSPs connected to LoopMe will get more ads displayed on user devices.\n\nRecommended : Top 10 Role of AI To Fight Bias In Recruitment\n\n\"Less than a half of patent applications pass the scrutiny of the U.S. patent office - so having two new patents granted is a big win for LoopMe,\" added Newnham.\n\nBoth of LoopMe's new patents reinforce the company's leading position in the programmatic advertising market, enabling the latest technology behind LoopMe's AI-led Intelligent Marketplace, which was shown to yield a 40x increase in DSP buying efficiencies. The Intelligent Marketplace manages more than 300 billion ad requests per day and serves 50,000+ leading apps and sites for clients like Magnite, PubMatic, StackAdapt, Xandr and Unity. With over 2 billion monthly active users in its DMP, the Intelligent Marketplace also enables access to all DSP partners to LoopMe's Marketplace Audiences and its proprietary first-party data.\n\nLoopMe's Intelligent Marketplace also provides significant sustainability benefits - the dynamic filtering capabilities suppress 98% of supply that won't receive a bid, which reduces the amount of impressions being returned along with decreasing emissions. This personalized demand-side traffic shaping capability makes LoopMe's Intelligent Marketplace greener by design, delivering a fully certified, sustainable supply path for its global partners, and in alignment with LoopMe's carbon net zero emission achievement.",

        "title": "2 Top Growth Stocks to Buy Right Now and Hold for 2024 and Beyond",
        "body": "To be classified as a growth stock, a company should be developing new products or services that help it gain share in existing markets, enter new markets, or create entirely new ones. These characteristics often lead to increased earnings growth rates, providing investors a path to generate substantial returns over the long term as products and markets evolve.\n\nThere are plenty of growth stocks out there today, but only some have as clear of a path to long-term success as Coinbase Global (NASDAQ: COIN) and Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA). With their embrace of innovation and expanding business models, the future is bright for these two companies. Let's dive deeper to see why Tesla and Coinbase should belong in every growth investor's portfolio.\n\nLeading the crypto revolution\n\nIt's no secret that Coinbase's success is closely tied to the health of the cryptocurrency market. So when crypto fell into a bear market, Coinbase's profits took a severe hit. At its lowest point, Coinbase posted a colossal $1 billion loss in the second quarter of 2022, but much has changed since the depths of the most recent crypto winter.\n\nOne of the main reasons Coinbase incurred such heavy losses was its reliance upon transaction fees as its primary source of revenue. At one point making up more than 90% of total revenue, when crypto prices plummeted and trading activity dried up, Coinbase's concentrated revenue model posed a serious threat to its future success.\n\nBut during the crypto winter, Coinbase used the downtime to rebuild and diversify. Today, the company generates just 53% of revenue from transaction fees as its innovative Subscription and Services product suite continues to grow.\n\nComprised of staking rewards, custodial fees, and earnings derived from its partnership with the issuer of USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, Subscriptions and Services is just one part of Coinbase's revitalization. In the last year, Coinbase launched its own blockchain, implemented an international expansion strategy, and released new derivative products for retail and institutional investors. Add in the fact that expenses are down nearly one-third from last year, and Coinbase is now just $2 million away from turning a profit.\n\nWith its revamped revenue model and cost-cutting measures, Coinbase is better prepared to mitigate the short-term volatility that often occurs in crypto. However, its long-term success is even more promising as the cryptocurrency market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 30% over the next five years.\n\nFor investors, Coinbase offers a clear and easy choice. Its resilience during the crypto winter should provide investors with confidence that it can navigate future uncertainties, while its diversified revenue model should generate healthy returns as crypto legitimization progresses.\n\nA true company of the future\n\nIt's no wonder that Tesla is one of the first companies that investors might think of when considering long-term growth opportunities. With its stronghold on the electric vehicle (EV) industry and growing trends in EV adoption, the company offers investors seeking long-term growth an excellent opportunity. Yet, while Tesla's position at the top of the EV market will likely continue well into the future, its most lucrative potential might actually come from other endeavors.\n\nOne of those is autonomous driving. Tesla's pursuit of eradicating drivers has been in the works for quite a while, but recent advancements hint that the fateful day might be closer than ever. While progress remains until it reaches the coveted Level 4 or 5 of autonomy, once Tesla does, it will not only change how we travel but also its revenue. Hoping to launch a robotaxi fleet, CEO Elon Musk believes autonomous driving is the catalyst that will send Tesla to a $10 trillion valuation.\n\nWhile Musk is no stranger to wishful thinking and optimistic predictions, he isn't alone in this belief. A report from Ark Invest estimates that the successful development of autonomy and the launch of a robotaxi fleet could generate up to $600 billion in additional revenue, a significant increase from the company's yearly revenue of nearly $100 billion today.\n\nTesla's EV success and the potential impact of robotaxis make it a promising long-term growth option. However, the company's prospects become even more exciting when considering the development of its humanoid robot, Optimus, and its supercomputer, Dojo. With its position at the forefront of innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotics, Tesla is one of the few companies that offer investors exposure to the most thrilling advancements of tomorrow.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Coinbase Global right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Coinbase Global, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Coinbase Global wasn't one of them.

        "title": "A Promising Future: Analyzing the Investment Potential of Xiao-I in Emerging AI Markets",
        "body": "In the AI space, Xiao-I is emerging as a notable player, not only because of its advanced AI technologies but also because of its significant economic achievements and forward-thinking strategies. This article will analyze Xiao-I's recent financial report, shedding light on its robust growth and outlining its strategic vision for the future.\n\nXiao-I recently unveiled its financial report for the first half of 2023, revealing substantial gains. Notably, the company reported a remarkable 106% year-over-year surge in net revenue, reaching an all-time high of $26.5 million, marking a historic milestone.\n\nFurthermore, the sale of cloud platform products experienced an extraordinary year-over-year increase of 523%, soaring to an impressive $22.7 million. This remarkable surge in cloud platform product sales serves as a testament to Xiao-I HuaZang's exceptional expertise and proficiency within the cloud technology space.\n\nEqually impressive was the company's gross profit, which soared by 124% year-over-year to reach $20.5 million, illustrating robust profitability. The gross margin stood at 77.3%, an impressive 620 basis points higher compared to the previous year, showcasing an enhanced profitability structure. When a company experiences a gross margin improvement, it signifies that it is becoming more efficient and effective in managing its production costs and pricing, ultimately leading to increased profitability. This improvement can be a positive sign for investors and stakeholders, as it often reflects better financial health and sustainable growth for the company.\n\nIn addition, the net income (excluding R&D expenses) witnessed a remarkable 155% year-over-year increase, surging to $10.9 million, underlining the company's strong financial performance.\n\nXiao-I's vision, which began with the launch of the Hua Zang Universal Large Model on June 29, signifies their commitment to reshaping the AI landscape. Their CEO's excitement about this milestone is grounded in the belief that we've entered a new era in artificial intelligence. Xiao-I has demonstrated its dedication to constructing a comprehensive Hua Zang Ecosystem, as seen through the launch on October 26.

        "body": "The European Music Managers Alliance (EMMA) and YouTube Music are expanding their existing collaboration, a move set to benefit over 2,000 music managers across Europe.\n\nBuilding upon EMMA's partnership with YouTube Music on its pan-European mentoring program, launched in 2019, the enhanced partnership will support EMMA's efforts in providing professional development services, expert-led training and network-building opportunities for managers throughout the continent.\n\nAdditionally, the collaboration will facilitate the development of research projects aimed at equipping policymakers with deeper insights into supporting Europe's diverse music industry, EMMA said.\n\n\"In a globalized music economy, the role of the manager is increasingly important, and yet frequently quite siloed. This is why national organizations and pan-European networks are so vital - enabling these entrepreneurial individuals to come together to develop new skills, share learnings and professionalize their work,\" said Jess Partridge, Executive Director, EMMA.\n\n\"In a globalized music economy, the role of the manager is increasingly important, and yet frequently quite siloed. This is why national organizations and pan-European networks are so vital.\"\n\nJess Partridge, EMMA\n\n\"Our partnership with YouTube Music is absolutely vital to this work. I am delighted they continue to recognize the importance of a healthy and vibrant management community, supporting EMMA in nurturing a more diverse and sustainable ecosystem for all creative talent.\"\n\nThis collaboration comes amid YouTube's broader commitment to supporting music managers, including its long-standing partnership with the UK's Music Managers Forum (MMF). In 2018, YouTube Music and MMF launched the Accelerator Programme for Music Managers (APMM), tipped as \"the first ever independent funding and professional development initiative designed solely for artist, songwriter and producer managers.\"\n\nEMMA said music managers are at the epicenter of the new music economy. The European music industry currently sustains about 2 million jobs and contributes to nearly one-third of global recorded music revenues. Additionally, Europe stands as a prominent global hub for live touring, hosting a variety of renowned festivals and concert venues.\n\nChristina Matteotti, Head of Music & Culture, EMEA Partnerships at Google, said: \"We are delighted to continue our partnership with EMMA and support the vital work they do in providing music managers with the tools they need to thrive in today's industry.\"\n\n\"YouTube's partnership with EMMA aligns perfectly with our wider aim of supporting talent on both sides of the mic, and we look forward to seeing how the next cohort of managers will help shape the music industry.\"\n\nChristina Matteotti, Google\n\n\"Being a music manager is a tough and often isolated job, so it's never been more important to provide the skills, training and mentorship that will enable managers to scale up their businesses, whilst providing a much-needed community and network. YouTube's partnership with EMMA aligns perfectly with our wider aim of supporting talent on both sides of the mic, and we look forward to seeing how the next cohort of managers will help shape the music industry.\"\n\nEstablished in 2018, EMMA serves as an umbrella organization and network for 13 national music manager bodies across Belgium, Denmark, Estonia, Finland, France, Germany, Ireland, the Netherlands, Norway, Poland, Spain, Sweden, and the UK. Collectively, these organizations represent over 2,000 music managers in Europe, with an additional 600 represented through partnerships with allied organizations in Australia, Canada, and New Zealand.\n\nEMMA also acts as a focal point of engagement for industry stakeholders, the public, and policymakers. The organization actively participates in discussions on the future of music, advocates for policy changes such as reforms of Europe's music streaming market, and explores the implications of emerging technologies like artificial intelligence on the music industry.\n\nThe organization's current projects include EMMpower, a three-year program dedicated to strengthening the European music management community through research, training, mentoring, and professional development. The program is co-funded by the European Union.",

        "title": "2 Top Growth Stocks to Buy Right Now and Hold for 2024 and Beyond | The Motley Fool",
        "body": "Does your portfolio need a boost? These two companies are compelling choices for savvy investors seeking long-term success.\n\nTo be classified as a growth stock, a company should be developing new products or services that help it gain share in existing markets, enter new markets, or create entirely new ones. These characteristics often lead to increased earnings growth rates, providing investors a path to generate substantial returns over the long term as products and markets evolve.\n\nThere are plenty of growth stocks out there today, but only some have as clear of a path to long-term success as Coinbase Global (COIN 5.04%) and Tesla (TSLA 2.04%). With their embrace of innovation and expanding business models, the future is bright for these two companies. Let's dive deeper to see why Tesla and Coinbase should belong in every growth investor's portfolio.\n\nIt's no secret that Coinbase's success is closely tied to the health of the cryptocurrency market. So when crypto fell into a bear market, Coinbase's profits took a severe hit. At its lowest point, Coinbase posted a colossal $1 billion loss in the second quarter of 2022, but much has changed since the depths of the most recent crypto winter.\n\nOne of the main reasons Coinbase incurred such heavy losses was its reliance upon transaction fees as its primary source of revenue. At one point making up more than 90% of total revenue, when crypto prices plummeted and trading activity dried up, Coinbase's concentrated revenue model posed a serious threat to its future success.\n\nBut during the crypto winter, Coinbase used the downtime to rebuild and diversify. Today, the company generates just 53% of revenue from transaction fees as its innovative Subscription and Services product suite continues to grow.\n\nComprised of staking rewards, custodial fees, and earnings derived from its partnership with the issuer of USDC, a stablecoin pegged to the U.S. dollar, Subscriptions and Services is just one part of Coinbase's revitalization. In the last year, Coinbase launched its own blockchain, implemented an international expansion strategy, and released new derivative products for retail and institutional investors. Add in the fact that expenses are down nearly one-third from last year, and Coinbase is now just $2 million away from turning a profit.\n\nWith its revamped revenue model and cost-cutting measures, Coinbase is better prepared to mitigate the short-term volatility that often occurs in crypto. However, its long-term success is even more promising as the cryptocurrency market is projected to grow at a compound annual growth rate of 30% over the next five years.\n\nFor investors, Coinbase offers a clear and easy choice. Its resilience during the crypto winter should provide investors with confidence that it can navigate future uncertainties, while its diversified revenue model should generate healthy returns as crypto legitimization progresses.\n\nIt's no wonder that Tesla is one of the first companies that investors might think of when considering long-term growth opportunities. With its stronghold on the electric vehicle (EV) industry and growing trends in EV adoption, the company offers investors seeking long-term growth an excellent opportunity. Yet, while Tesla's position at the top of the EV market will likely continue well into the future, its most lucrative potential might actually come from other endeavors.\n\nOne of those is autonomous driving. Tesla's pursuit of eradicating drivers has been in the works for quite a while, but recent advancements hint that the fateful day might be closer than ever. While progress remains until it reaches the coveted Level 4 or 5 of autonomy, once Tesla does, it will not only change how we travel but also its revenue. Hoping to launch a robotaxi fleet, CEO Elon Musk believes autonomous driving is the catalyst that will send Tesla to a $10 trillion valuation.\n\nWhile Musk is no stranger to wishful thinking and optimistic predictions, he isn't alone in this belief. A report from Ark Invest estimates that the successful development of autonomy and the launch of a robotaxi fleet could generate up to $600 billion in additional revenue, a significant increase from the company's yearly revenue of nearly $100 billion today.\n\nTesla's EV success and the potential impact of robotaxis make it a promising long-term growth option. However, the company's prospects become even more exciting when considering the development of its humanoid robot, Optimus, and its supercomputer, Dojo. With its position at the forefront of innovative technologies such as artificial intelligence and robotics, Tesla is one of the few companies that offer investors exposure to the most thrilling advancements of tomorrow.",

        "body": "Mark Pierpoint, vice president of strategic innovation and partnerships at Keysight Technologies gives his view of the year ahead in telecoms and tech; he discusses the opportunities and challenges with artificial intelligence (AI), environmental, social and governance (ESG) initiatives around energy transition, and the new space race with low-earth orbit (LEO) satellite communications.\n\nAI unmasked - from hype to reality\n\nDespite all the hype around AI and generative AI, the technology is far away from being able to automate and optimise every aspect of our lives anytime soon. AI is making progress; however, automating a chatbot or creating a digital assistant are constrained problems that are much easier to automate.\n\nWhen it comes to helping manage real-world processes such as optimising call quality on a 5G network or managing energy consumption, these are incredibly complex operations, with a wide array of variables requiring vast unbiased data sets before AI can be effective. While the intelligence will undoubtedly help us in 2024, realistically, AI will not be ready to direct physical-world activities until the end of the decade.\n\nEnergy usage drives tech decisions\n\nTechnology decisions, rather than solely evaluating performance and cost, will increasingly take into account sustainability. Energy efficiency will be a C-suite imperative influencing every decision in order to achieve environmental goals.\n\nTo support the shift to more renewable energy, the grid will increasingly need to add storage to enable utility companies to manage the peaks and troughs of demand efficiently. Additionally, before the end of the decade, there needs to be a widespread acceptance that nuclear energy is a critical component required to meet Net Zero goals.\n\nToday, we lose about 50 percent of electrical energy through losses in distribution, so microgrids will become increasingly popular as they can generate, distribute, and control energy close to where it is used. The ability to provide reliable and resilient power will see them used in a diverse range of applications spanning suburbs, rural electrification, military bases, and critical infrastructure facilities.\n\nSpace race - the next must-have tech\n\nAdvances in technology have dramatically reduced the cost of putting a LEO (low earth orbit) satellite into space. And as countries understand the risks of not having their own satellite network, demand will continue to rise, and the price will continue to fall. Without considering the risk of disrupting earth-based astronomy, regulations are needed to manage the growing problem of space junk.\n\nAs satellite constellations increasingly support communications with individual satellite lifetimes of about five years, the risk of space debris damaging critical infrastructure will escalate. Without some agreements, a significant incident will undoubtedly occur over the next decade. As more and more communication happens in space, a wealth of new data privacy and security risks will also need to be addressed.",

Nate Glubish, Minister of Technology and Innovation for the Government of Alberta. \"The establishment of an Amazon Web Services infrastructure Region near Calgary further strengthens our information technology sector and supports businesses and public sector organizations while helping to attract the best-in-class talent.\"\n\nWith the launch of the AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region, AWS has 105 Availability Zones across 33 geographic regions, with announced plans to launch 12 more Availability Zones and four more AWS Regions in Malaysia, New Zealand, Thailand, and the AWS European Sovereign Cloud. The AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region consists of three Availability Zones and joins the existing AWS Canada (Central) Region, which opened in December 2016. AWS Regions are composed of Availability Zones that place infrastructure in separate and distinct geographic locations. Availability Zones are located far enough from each other to support customers' business continuity, but near enough to provide low latency for high availability applications that use multiple Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone has independent power, cooling, and physical security and is connected through redundant, ultra-low-latency networks. AWS customers focused on high availability can design their applications to run in multiple Availability Zones to achieve even greater fault tolerance.\n\nWith the launch of the new AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region, AWS becomes the first major cloud services provider to have an infrastructure region in Western Canada. The launch of the AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region provides customers with more options to run workloads with even greater resilience and availability, and to securely store data in Canada, while providing even lower latency across the country to drive greater productivity, more efficient business operations, and enhanced real-time application performance. Customers can now use the AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region, in addition to the AWS Canada (Central) Region, for use cases such as disaster recovery and can run their mission-critical applications across multiple AWS Regions in Canada with even higher levels of resilience and availability. Customers also have access to advanced AWS technologies to accelerate innovation, including compute, storage, networking, business applications, developer tools, data analytics, security, ML, and AI. As part of its infrastructure across the country, AWS has launched eight total Amazon CloudFront locations in Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. Amazon CloudFront is a highly secure and programmable content delivery network (CDN) that accelerates the delivery of data, videos, applications, and APIs to users worldwide, with low latency and high transfer speeds. In addition, AWS has announced AWS Local Zones in Toronto and Vancouver. AWS Local Zones are a type of AWS infrastructure deployment that places compute, storage, database, and other select services closer to customers for applications that require single-digit millisecond latency to end users.\n\nAWS also released an economic impact study estimating the company's projected spending on the construction and operation of its two AWS infrastructure Regions in Canada will support an average of more than 9,300 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs at external businesses annually, with a planned investment of more than $17.9 billion (approx. CA $24.8 billion) through 2037. The new AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region, specifically, is estimated to support an average of more than 1,300 FTE jobs annually, and AWS plans to invest more than $2.9 billion (approx. CA $4 billion) in Alberta through 2037. These jobs, including construction, facility maintenance, engineering, telecommunications, and others within the country's broader economy, will be part of the AWS supply chain in Canada. In addition, the construction and operation of the two AWS infrastructure Regions is estimated to generate more than $31 billion (approx.

Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge and became its first signatory in 2019. As part of its Climate Pledge commitment, Amazon is on a path to power its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of the original 2030 target. See Amazon's public methodology for more on its approach. In 2022, Amazon set a new corporate record for the most renewable energy announced by a single company in one year and remains the largest corporate buyer of renewable energy -- a position it's held since 2020, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Amazon now has 479 renewable energy projects in 26 countries. Additionally, AWS will be water positive by 2030, returning more water to communities than it uses in its direct operations.\n\nWith a total of four renewable energy projects in Canada, Amazon is currently the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the country, according to Bloomberg NEF. Once operational, the projects will generate more than 2.3 million megawatt hours (MWH) of clean energy - enough to power 1.69 million Canadian homes. Amazon recently announced its first wind farm in Vulcan County, Alberta, and has previously invested in two solar farms, as well as a rooftop solar energy project at an Amazon delivery station in Nisku, Alberta. Amazon's solar and wind projects are also helping benefit the local economy in Canada. New economic data from Amazon shows the company's investments in utility-scale renewable energy projects generated an estimated CA $478 million in local economic investment, and contributed CA $206 million in total gross domestic product (GDP) from 2014 through 2022. These projects will contribute to powering Amazon's global infrastructure. More information on AWS sustainability efforts can be found at aws.amazon.com/about-aws/sustainability.\n\nAbout Amazon Web Services\n\nSince 2006, Amazon Web Services has been the world's most comprehensive and broadly adopted cloud.

        "title": "GenAI Will Shape American Foreign Policy",
        "body": "(NewsUSA) - When it comes to generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), the United States government needs to adjust its mission and tradecraft to advance American interests, according to experts at the Special Competitive Studies Project (SCSP), a bipartisan nonprofit organization.\n\nDespite its current position as a global leader GenAI, the issue facing the United States is how to shape GenAI's global use and function so that it reinforces these interests, according to a new report from SCSP.\n\nThe authors outline recommendations for a new model of statecraft and the creation of global institutions to chart a way for GenAI to be used for good, and to put guardrails in place to protect against negative consequences.\n\nSCSP advises the U.S. government to bring together different departments, authorities, talents, and tools, and to establish domestic regulatory policies that also reflect a global context, to work alongside like-minded allies, but not to disadvantage the U.S. private sector in global competition.\n\nPlatforms Statecraft. A platform approach to foreign policy and GenAI should include an updated mission with competition around technology platforms, as well as joint efforts across government agencies, modernization, and sub-national diplomacy to ensure that U.S. policy is tied into domestic innovation at the state and local levels.\n\nNew Tools. The adoption of GenAI tools by the Department of State will change the way workforces do their jobs, but these high-tech tools do not replace decision-making by policy experts; instead, GenAI tools provide additional, and potentially novel, recommendations and solutions based on an amount of information that no one human can process as quickly as a machine. Agency-wide programs to leverage GenAI could include a centralized GenAI infrastructure, a tailored GenAI system to handle sensitive information, and training policy makers to understand how GI works and where human oversight is needed.\n\nGlobal Frameworks. To manage GenAI as a geopolitical and transnational issue, SCSP recommends creating a leaders-level forum to bring together key nations and address the highest-level risks that GenAI may pose; a leaders-level agenda item on GenAI in bilateral dialogues between the U.S. and the People's Republic of Chine to help manage strategic stability risks; and a working-level forum for like-minded national to explore positive use cases around GenAI and mitigate against practical challenges.\n\nFor more information, visit scsp.ai.",

        "title": "AWS (AMZN) Launches Second Infrastructure Region in Canada",
        "body": "Amazon Web Services (AWS), an Amazon.com, Inc. company (NASDAQ: AMZN), today announced the launch of its second AWS infrastructure Region in Canadaâ\"the AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region. Starting today, developers, startups, entrepreneurs, and enterprises, as well as government, education, and nonprofit organizations, will have greater choice for running their applications and serving end users from AWS data centers located in Canada. Customers will also have access to advanced AWS technologies, including data analytics, security, machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI), to drive innovation. AWS also released a new economic impact study highlighting that the company is planning to invest an estimated $17.9 billion (approximately CA $24.8 billion) in Canada through 2037 via the new AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region and the existing AWS Canada (Central) Region in Quebec. For more information about AWS Global Infrastructure, visit aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure.\n\nâWith the launch of the AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region, customers and partners across Canada now have additional infrastructure to deploy applications with greater resilience, availability, and lower latency, while enabling more customers to innovate with advanced technologies like artificial intelligence to help fuel economic development across the country,â said Prasad Kalyanaraman, vice president of Infrastructure Services at AWS. âAWS is committed to helping organizations of all sizes and across all industries increase agility and drive innovation. We are proud to deepen our investment by driving local job creation, building cloud skills, and creating opportunities for growth and collaboration with our local customers and AWS Partners.â\n\nâOur government is committed to positioning our domestic industries for long-term growth and sustainability. The powerful digital infrastructure being established by Amazon Web Services near Calgary, Alberta will support Canadian developers, startups, large enterprises and academic institutions in their work by enabling access to AWSâs powerful advanced cloud technologies,â said The Hon. FranÃ§ois-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, Government of Canada. âThis means faster and more reliable access to cloud services to support computing, storage, networking, analytics, artificial intelligence, mobile, hybrid, media, and security, which helps to secure well-paying jobs across many new industries.â\n\nâAlberta has one of the fastest growing tech markets in North America and is an internationally recognized hub of tech innovation,â said the Hon. Nate Glubish, Minister of Technology and Innovation for the Government of Alberta. âThe establishment of an Amazon Web Services infrastructure Region near Calgary further strengthens our information technology sector and supports businesses and public sector organizations while helping to attract the best-in-class talent.â\n\nWith the launch of the AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region, AWS has 105 Availability Zones across 33 geographic regions, with announced plans to launch 12 more Availability Zones and four more AWS Regions in Malaysia, New Zealand, Thailand, and the AWS European Sovereign Cloud. The AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region consists of three Availability Zones and joins the existing AWS Canada (Central) Region, which opened in December 2016. AWS Regions are composed of Availability Zones that place infrastructure in separate and distinct geographic locations. Availability Zones are located far enough from each other to support customersâ business continuity, but near enough to provide low latency for high availability applications that use multiple Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone has independent power, cooling, and physical security and is connected through redundant, ultra-low-latency networks. AWS customers focused on high availability can design their applications to run in multiple Availability Zones to achieve even greater fault tolerance.\n\nWith the launch of the new AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region, AWS becomes the first major cloud services provider to have an infrastructure region in Western Canada. The launch of the AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region provides customers with more options to run workloads with even greater resilience and availability, and to securely store data in Canada, while providing even lower latency across the country to drive greater productivity, more efficient business operations, and enhanced real-time application performance. Customers can now use the AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region, in addition to the AWS Canada (Central) Region, for use cases such as disaster recovery and can run their mission-critical applications across multiple AWS Regions in Canada with even higher levels of resilience and availability. Customers also have access to advanced AWS technologies to accelerate innovation, including compute, storage, networking, business applications, developer tools, data analytics, security, ML, and AI. As part of its infrastructure across the country, AWS has launched eight total Amazon CloudFront locations in Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. Amazon CloudFront is a highly secure and programmable content delivery network (CDN) that accelerates the delivery of data, videos, applications, and APIs to users worldwide, with low latency and high transfer speeds. In addition, AWS has announced AWS Local Zones in Toronto and Vancouver. AWS Local Zones are a type of AWS infrastructure deployment that places compute, storage, database, and other select services closer to customers for applications that require single-digit millisecond latency to end users.\n\nAWS also released an economic impact study estimating the companyâs projected spending on the construction and operation of its two AWS infrastructure Regions in Canada will support an average of more than 9,300 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs at external businesses annually, with a planned investment of more than $17.9 billion (approx. CA $24.8 billion) through 2037. The new AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region, specifically, is estimated to support an average of more than 1,300 FTE jobs annually, and AWS plans to invest more than $2.9 billion (approx. CA $4 billion) in Alberta through 2037. These jobs, including construction, facility maintenance, engineering, telecommunications, and others within the countryâs broader economy, will be part of the AWS supply chain in Canada. In addition, the construction and operation of the two AWS infrastructure Regions is estimated to generate more than $31 billion (approx. CA $43.02 billion) in gross domestic product (GDP), and the new AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region is estimated to add about $4.1 billion (CA $5.62 billion) to Canadaâs GDP through 2037.\n\nCustomers and AWS Partners welcome the AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region\n\nTens of thousands of Canadian organizations are among the millions of active customers using AWS around the world.

The company manages and advises on approximately $420.7 billion in client assets. âWe moved to AWS to improve our customer service, optimize business performance, and promote company-wide growth through the acquisition of new clients,â said Ravi Kishore, director, Cloud Platform Engineering & Operations, CI Financial. âWith our strategic business applications now running on AWS, weâre developing new products faster than before, and leveraging our data to drive business decisions â\" continuously adapting to our customersâ evolving needs and enhancing their experience. The new AWS Region near Calgary will help us further advance our operations with real-time analytics, while keeping all data in-country.â\n\nKOHO Financial (KOHO) is a Vancouver-based fintech company that is democratizing access to personal finance solutions by offering Canadians accessible, affordable spending and savings products. KOHOâs core business applications were born on AWS, and the company uses AWSâs AI and machine learning services in several areas of its operations. âThe new AWS Region near Calgary will deliver several benefits for our business, including having a failover region in-country so we can provide improved resiliency and reduced latency to our users,â said Jonathan Klein, chief technology officer, KOHO.\n\nThe National Hockey League is the premiere hockey league in the world and has been using AWS as its official cloud infrastructure provider to help analyze the details of the game for hockey fans, teams, and media partners. The NHL uses AWS artificial intelligence, machine learning, and more for its advanced analytic derivatives, NHL EdgeIQ powered by AWS. âAWS is an industry leader in its portfolio of cloud services, helping to enable us to bring our fans closer to the game on the ice, while giving every team, official, and media partner advanced analysis of the game faster than ever before,â said Dave Lehanski, NHL executive vice president, Business Development and Innovation. âWith the launch of a second AWS Region in Canada, this provides us more flexibility, reliability, and security to unlock more opportunities to engage our fans across Canada and the world to better understand and enjoy the game.â\n\nSECURE is a leading environmental waste management and energy infrastructure company with an extensive network of waste processing facilities, landfills, metal recycling facilities, fluid management facilities, gathering pipelines, and terminals in Western Canada and the United States. âWeâve been working with AWS since 2021 to evaluate how SECURE uses analytics to provide a best-in-class customer experience, while solving challenges our industry faces every day,â said Marvin Wong, vice president, Business Intelligence, Technology and Security at SECURE. âLeveraging AWS artificial intelligence and machine learning services like Amazon SageMaker and Amazon Forecast allows us to reduce time required to turn imagining into reality. In turn, SECURE and our customers can approach complex problems with agility to improve efficiency, sustainability, and provide solutions to optimize waste management. The data residency and lower latency provided by the AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region will allow SECURE to further our use of real-time data, helping us and our customers continue to challenge what is possible to create a more connected and efficient industry.â\n\nSTEMCELL Technologies is Canadaâs largest biotech company, which manufactures and distributes more than 2,500 scientific products to labs globally. STEMCELL relies on AWS to scale its operations, optimize costs, and increase the speed of innovation to better serve its life science customers. âTechnology is at the core of our companyâs ongoing digital transformation and long-term growth,â said John Lilleyman, chief information officer at STEMCELL. âWe moved to AWS in 2010 to help us focus our efforts on supporting science at a hyperscale level. As a result, teams spent less time on infrastructure and maintenance, and more time on innovating. The addition of this second AWS Region in Canada will help us to further improve the resilience of our critical workloads and help ensure we provide our employees, the majority of whom are based in Greater Vancouver, a low latency user experience.â\n\nSun Life is a leading international financial services organization providing asset management, wealth, insurance and health solutions to individual and institutional clients. âWeâve been on a journey to be a digital leader so we can help our clients achieve lifetime financial security and live healthier lives,â said Laura Money, EVP and chief information and technology innovation officer at Sun Life. âThe launch of a second AWS Region in Canada is a critical step that will help us ensure greater resilience, stability and scalability so we can better support our clients across Canada.â\n\nTELUS, a leading communications technology company, is collaborating with AWS to simplify and transform the smart living experience.

Starting today, developers, startups, entrepreneurs, and enterprises, as well as government, education, and nonprofit organizations, will have greater choice for running their applications and serving end users from AWS data centers located in Canada. Customers will also have access to advanced AWS technologies, including data analytics, security, machine learning (ML), and artificial intelligence (AI), to drive innovation. AWS also released a new economic impact study highlighting that the company is planning to invest an estimated $17.9 billion (approximately CA $24.8 billion) in Canada through 2037 via the new AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region and the existing AWS Canada (Central) Region in Quebec. For more information about AWS Global Infrastructure, visit aws.amazon.com/about-aws/global-infrastructure.\n\nâWith the launch of the AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region, customers and partners across Canada now have additional infrastructure to deploy applications with greater resilience, availability, and lower latency, while enabling more customers to innovate with advanced technologies like artificial intelligence to help fuel economic development across the country,â said Prasad Kalyanaraman, vice president of Infrastructure Services at AWS. âAWS is committed to helping organizations of all sizes and across all industries increase agility and drive innovation. We are proud to deepen our investment by driving local job creation, building cloud skills, and creating opportunities for growth and collaboration with our local customers and AWS Partners.â\n\nâOur government is committed to positioning our domestic industries for long-term growth and sustainability. The powerful digital infrastructure being established by Amazon Web Services near Calgary, Alberta will support Canadian developers, startups, large enterprises and academic institutions in their work by enabling access to AWSâs powerful advanced cloud technologies,â said The Hon. FranÃ§ois-Philippe Champagne, Minister of Innovation, Science and Industry, Government of Canada. âThis means faster and more reliable access to cloud services to support computing, storage, networking, analytics, artificial intelligence, mobile, hybrid, media, and security, which helps to secure well-paying jobs across many new industries.â\n\nâAlberta has one of the fastest growing tech markets in North America and is an internationally recognized hub of tech innovation,â said the Hon. Nate Glubish, Minister of Technology and Innovation for the Government of Alberta. âThe establishment of an Amazon Web Services infrastructure Region near Calgary further strengthens our information technology sector and supports businesses and public sector organizations while helping to attract the best-in-class talent.â\n\nWith the launch of the AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region, AWS has 105 Availability Zones across 33 geographic regions, with announced plans to launch 12 more Availability Zones and four more AWS Regions in Malaysia, New Zealand, Thailand, and the AWS European Sovereign Cloud. The AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region consists of three Availability Zones and joins the existing AWS Canada (Central) Region, which opened in December 2016. AWS Regions are composed of Availability Zones that place infrastructure in separate and distinct geographic locations. Availability Zones are located far enough from each other to support customersâ business continuity, but near enough to provide low latency for high availability applications that use multiple Availability Zones. Each Availability Zone has independent power, cooling, and physical security and is connected through redundant, ultra-low-latency networks. AWS customers focused on high availability can design their applications to run in multiple Availability Zones to achieve even greater fault tolerance.\n\nWith the launch of the new AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region, AWS becomes the first major cloud services provider to have an infrastructure region in Western Canada. The launch of the AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region provides customers with more options to run workloads with even greater resilience and availability, and to securely store data in Canada, while providing even lower latency across the country to drive greater productivity, more efficient business operations, and enhanced real-time application performance. Customers can now use the AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region, in addition to the AWS Canada (Central) Region, for use cases such as disaster recovery and can run their mission-critical applications across multiple AWS Regions in Canada with even higher levels of resilience and availability. Customers also have access to advanced AWS technologies to accelerate innovation, including compute, storage, networking, business applications, developer tools, data analytics, security, ML, and AI. As part of its infrastructure across the country, AWS has launched eight total Amazon CloudFront locations in Toronto, Montreal, and Vancouver. Amazon CloudFront is a highly secure and programmable content delivery network (CDN) that accelerates the delivery of data, videos, applications, and APIs to users worldwide, with low latency and high transfer speeds. In addition, AWS has announced AWS Local Zones in Toronto and Vancouver. AWS Local Zones are a type of AWS infrastructure deployment that places compute, storage, database, and other select services closer to customers for applications that require single-digit millisecond latency to end users.\n\nAWS also released an economic impact study estimating the companyâs projected spending on the construction and operation of its two AWS infrastructure Regions in Canada will support an average of more than 9,300 full-time equivalent (FTE) jobs at external businesses annually, with a planned investment of more than $17.9 billion (approx. CA $24.8 billion) through 2037. The new AWS Canada West (Calgary) Region, specifically, is estimated to support an average of more than 1,300 FTE jobs annually, and AWS plans to invest more than $2.9 billion (approx. CA $4 billion) in Alberta through 2037. These jobs, including construction, facility maintenance, engineering, telecommunications, and others within the countryâs broader economy, will be part of the AWS supply chain in Canada. In addition, the construction and operation of the two AWS infrastructure Regions is estimated to generate more than $31 billion (approx.

Amazon co-founded The Climate Pledge and became its first signatory in 2019. As part of its Climate Pledge commitment, Amazon is on a path to power its operations with 100% renewable energy by 2025, five years ahead of the original 2030 target. See Amazon's public methodology for more on its approach. In 2022, Amazon set a new corporate record for the most renewable energy announced by a single company in one year and remains the largest corporate buyer of renewable energyâ\"a position itâs held since 2020, according to Bloomberg New Energy Finance. Amazon now has 479 renewable energy projects in 26 countries. Additionally, AWS will be water positive by 2030, returning more water to communities than it uses in its direct operations.\n\nWith a total of four renewable energy projects in Canada, Amazon is currently the largest corporate purchaser of renewable energy in the country, according to Bloomberg NEF. Once operational, the projects will generate more than 2.3 million megawatt hours (MWH) of clean energy â\" enough to power 1.69 million Canadian homes. Amazon recently announced its first wind farm in Vulcan County, Alberta, and has previously invested in two solar farms, as well as a rooftop solar energy project at an Amazon delivery station in Nisku, Alberta. Amazonâs solar and wind projects are also helping benefit the local economy in Canada.

        "title": "GenAI Will Shape American Foreign Policy",
        "body": "(NewsUSA) - When it comes to generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), the United States government needs to adjust its mission and tradecraft to advance American interests, according to experts at the Special Competitive Studies Project (SCSP), a bipartisan nonprofit organization.\n\nDespite its current position as a global leader GenAI, the issue facing the United States is how to shape GenAI's global use and function so that it reinforces these interests, according to a new report from SCSP.\n\nThe authors outline recommendations for a new model of statecraft and the creation of global institutions to chart a way for GenAI to be used for good, and to put guardrails in place to protect against negative consequences.\n\nSCSP advises the U.S. government to bring together different departments, authorities, talents, and tools, and to establish domestic regulatory policies that also reflect a global context, to work alongside like-minded allies, but not to disadvantage the U.S. private sector in global competition.\n\nPlatforms Statecraft. A platform approach to foreign policy and GenAI should include an updated mission with competition around technology platforms, as well as joint efforts across government agencies, modernization, and sub-national diplomacy to ensure that U.S. policy is tied into domestic innovation at the state and local levels.\n\nNew Tools. The adoption of GenAI tools by the Department of State will change the way workforces do their jobs, but these high-tech tools do not replace decision-making by policy experts; instead, GenAI tools provide additional, and potentially novel, recommendations and solutions based on an amount of information that no one human can process as quickly as a machine. Agency-wide programs to leverage GenAI could include a centralized GenAI infrastructure, a tailored GenAI system to handle sensitive information, and training policy makers to understand how GI works and where human oversight is needed.\n\nGlobal Frameworks. To manage GenAI as a geopolitical and transnational issue, SCSP recommends creating a leaders-level forum to bring together key nations and address the highest-level risks that GenAI may pose; a leaders-level agenda item on GenAI in bilateral dialogues between the U.S. and the People's Republic of Chine to help manage strategic stability risks; and a working-level forum for like-minded national to explore positive use cases around GenAI and mitigate against practical challenges.\n\nFor more information, visit scsp.ai.",

        "title": "Transportation Analytics Market Size & Analysis Report - 2032",
        "body": "Transportation Analytics Market was valued at USD 12.2 billion in 2023 and is estimated to register a CAGR of over 18% between 2024 and 2032. With the increasing congestion in urban areas and the need for efficient transportation systems, analytics plays a crucial role in traffic management and optimization. Transportation analytics helps monitor and analyze traffic patterns, identify bottlenecks, and suggest optimal routes, which is essential for improving the overall traffic flow, reducing congestion, and minimizing travel times. These benefits have encouraged both established and new players in this space to introduce cutting-edge technologies, thus helping the evolution of the transportation sector.\n\nFor instance, in January 2023, GoodVision Ltd, a London-based startup committed to advancing the transportation industry through cutting-edge technology and AI, successfully secured approximately USD 2.9 million investment to accelerate its global growth. The company's flagship product, \"GoodVision Video Insights,\" is a highly scalable Software as a Service (SaaS) solution with a global reach. Currently, it is actively monitoring traffic conditions in the Czech Republic, identifying traffic violations in Brazil, analyzing freeway traffic in Minnesota, and providing coverage for the Danish stage of the Tour de France.\n\nIncreased emphasis on data-driven decision-making will play a key role in shaping the transportation analytics market outlook. Transportation analytics leverages big data and advanced analytics to process and analyze vast amounts of data generated by transportation systems. This allows organizations to make informed and data-driven decisions. As the transportation industry seeks to optimize routes, reduce delays, and enhance overall efficiency, the demand for analytics tools that can process and interpret this data continues to grow.\n\nQuoting an instance, in August 2023, Cambridge Systematics (CS) joined forces with Geotab ITS, a business unit of Geotab focused on providing practical insights for enhancing transportation networks. This collaboration aims to integrate CS' industry-leading big data platform, LOCUS, with Geotab ITS' extensive dataset derived from commercial vehicles to create a novel freight planning and analytics tool known as LOCUS Truck. Already adopted by over 40 agencies across the United States, the LOCUS platform is versatile, serving various applications in passenger transportation, performance evaluation, electric vehicle charging, and safety. By harnessing anonymized location data from connected vehicles and smartphones, LOCUS transforms this information into actionable insights, offering detailed analyses of movement trends.\n\nHowever, concerns about the privacy and security of this data have been a significant restraint. Analyzing transportation data often involves handling sensitive information, such as location details and travel patterns. Ensuring the privacy of individuals and protecting against potential cyber threats becomes a critical challenge, and the industry must navigate these concerns to gain public trust and comply with regulations.\n\nThe integration of AI and ML technologies is expected to play a pivotal role in shaping the future of transportation analytics. These advanced technologies can analyze vast datasets to identify patterns, optimize routing, predict traffic congestion, and enhance decision-making processes. As the transportation industry continues to embrace automation, AI and ML applications are likely to become increasingly integral for achieving efficiency and responsiveness in real-time transportation analytics. Citing an example, in June 2023, NEC Corporation of America (NEC), a prominent provider and integrator of advanced IT, communications, and networking solutions, partnered with the Virginia Tech Transportation Institute (VTTI), a renowned leader in transportation research. Together, they have integrated private 5G and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to develop an innovative roadway warning system with the potential to enhance safety and save lives. This solution combines private 5G infrastructure, state-of-the-art AI-driven video analytics, and Cellular Vehicle-to-Everything (C-V2X) technology to create a system that contributes to the safety and security of vehicles and pedestrians near intersections.\n\nTo understand key market trends &nbsp\n\nDownload Free Sample\n\nBased on component, the market is divided into solutions and services.

        "title": "2 Growth Stocks Down 67% and 91% That are Excellent Buys for December | The Motley Fool",
        "body": "Spurred by market-moving trends, including the rise of artificial intelligence (AI), 2023 has been a great year for growth stocks. Explosive gains for companies including Nvidia, Microsoft, and Apple helped to push the S&P 500 index up roughly 24% across this year's trading. Meanwhile, the even more growth-oriented Nasdaq Composite index has surged 43% across the stretch.\n\nOf course, the explosive gains for growth stocks this year also have to be viewed in the context of big sell-offs that took place in 2022. And while some large tech companies have come roaring back to reach new valuation highs this year, the market-shaping recovery has been unevenly distributed. Some fantastic companies with explosive potential still trade at big discounts compared to previous highs, and investors still have plenty of opportunities to capitalize.\n\nIf you're looking for top growth stocks still trading at levels that leave room for explosive returns, read on to see why two Motley Fool contributors believe you should buy these stocks before 2023 falls off the calendar.\n\nThis beaten-down growth stock could soar\n\nKeith Noonan: Roblox (RBLX 0.54%) is a leading online social entertainment platform. While the company's service is often thought of as a video game platform, it actually hosts an incredible breadth of games and social experiences. In modern terms, Roblox is better described as a metaverse -- and it's one of the most successful takes on creating a thriving online virtual world so far.\n\nBut while Roblox's long-term growth trajectory and recent business performance have been quite impressive, the company's stock performance is best described as volatile. When the company went public in March 2021, it was still seeing elevated engagement levels related to social-distancing policies stemming from the coronavirus pandemic. The Federal Reserve had also yet to kick off its accelerated program of interest rate hikes to combat inflation, and the market's appetite for growth stocks was still relatively high.\n\nBusiness and market conditions changed quickly in 2022, and Roblox got crushed. The company went through a period in which engagement and sales growth were hampered by the easing of pandemic-related conditions, and investors quickly fell out of love with the stock.\n\nBut even though the business has returned to setting new engagement records and posting strong sales and bookings growth, the market remained lukewarm on Roblox. With the company's share price still down 67% from its high, I think that investors can score wins by capitalizing on the disparity between the metaverse leader's stock moves and its recent business performance and long-term growth potential.\n\nWith revenue surging 38% year over year to reach $713.2 million in the third quarter, concerns about Roblox being a flash in the pan can be safely set aside. Even better, the company is still in the early stages of rolling out its digital advertising and generative artificial intelligence (AI) initiatives.\n\nRoblox still has massive growth opportunities ahead, and investors could score wins by building a position in the stock while it's still down big from its previous peak.\n\nFearing artificial intelligence, Fiverr is selling cheaply.\n\nParkev Tatevosian: Fiverr International's (FVRR 0.25%) stock price is down a whopping 91% off its high water mark reached in 2021. While the company faces some challenges, notably the impact of AI on its business, I think the sell-off is overdone. Meanwhile, Fiverr continues to demonstrate excellent revenue growth and it's making progress on profitability.\n\nIndeed, from 2017 to 2022, Fiverr's revenue expanded from $52 million to $337 million. The company operates a platform that brings together buyers and sellers of services. For instance, someone who wants to hire an individual to make YouTube thumbnails can find plenty of choices on the Fiverr platform.\n\nFor its services, Fiverr takes a fee from each transaction occurring on its platform. That has proven to be a scalable business model, as Fiverr's operating income has improved from negative $8 million to negative $2 million from the June-ended quarter in 2021 to the September-ended quarter in 2023.\n\nThe business model is built to scale efficiently, as Fiverr does not need major capital investments to grow the business. The primary factor for growth will continue to be Fiverr to build its ecosystem, attracting more buyers and sellers to sign up.\n\nFiverr stock trades at a forward price-to-earnings ratio of 12, a relatively cheap valuation for a company with its growth characteristics. Of course, there is reason for the discount.\n\nAI threatens to replace some of the services offered on the Fiverr platform. Rather than hiring someone on Fiverr to complete a service, businesses can use AI to complete the task. That might be true to some level, but I think there is an overreaction to the risk, and Fiverr stock could be an excellent growth stock to buy for long-term investors.",

        "body": "New Cogito survey finds 46% of consumers prefer to speak to a human agent, but are comfortable with AI-assisted human interactions\n\nCogito, the leader in real-time AI coaching and guidance for the enterprise, announced survey results that reveal insights into how consumers prefer to interact with human agents and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to manage their customer service issues. Focusing on support issues related to the Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping weekend, the new report confirms the need for companies to balance AI and automation capabilities with human interactions to deliver strong customer experiences (CX).\n\nFor most consumers, it's not a question of if they will reach out to customer support channels, it's a matter of when, where, and how. More than half (53%) of consumers stated they prefer to chat with a live agent via the telephone when it comes to complex customer service questions or issues, while only 17% would prefer to use technology like live chat via a website or mobile app.\n\nRecommended AI News: Riding on the Generative AI Hype, CDP Needs a New Definition in 2024\n\nWhen it comes to interacting with AI for customer service inquiries, nearly half (46%) of consumers surveyed would prefer to speak to a real human but feel comfortable if the agent is using AI in the background to improve the interaction. This data confirms that, while enterprises who don't take advantage of AI are leaving opportunities and revenue on the table, it's important to implement the technology strategically. The goal is not to replace agents but rather, empower and inform them with tools and data insights to improve customer service interactions.\n\n\"We are increasingly learning from our customers that 2024 will be about consolidating costs and driving revenue. The first effort to do so is to augment, rather than replace, the agent's role by integrating AI into existing workflows,\" said Josh Feast, CEO and co-founder of Cogito. \"It's validating to see consumers agree with this notion -- wanting to keep the human touch in the contact center but with the agent using technology to ensure they're delivering the best service and CX possible.\"\n\nThe stakes to get the CX right are high, with 76% of consumers surveyed stating a negative customer service experience would impact them choosing a brand's products/services in the future, with 61% saying they'd consider other brands first, and 15% saying they'd never be a customer again. As AI continues to revolutionize contact center operations, it's important to balance the human and AI approach to better meet these high customer expectations.\n\nRecommended AI News: Ansys Unveils AVxcelerate Autonomy: Advancing ADAS/AV Systems Development from L2+ to Beyond\n\nCustomer Preferences: Humans and Technology\n\nThe immediate future of the contact center is not robots, but AI-assisted human interactions. When implemented effectively, these interactions create a win-win-win situation. Customers receive the benefit of a more informed agent to resolve issues faster; agents are empowered to be more effective in their jobs leading to less turnover and better employee experiences; and lastly, enterprises win with reduced operating costs, improved productivity, and lower customer and employee attrition rates. Contact center leaders should keep these consumer insights in mind to fully understand how customers prefer to engage with humans and technology, and how AI can be used to bolster agent-customer interactions.\n\nRecommended AI News: Kasada Unleashes the Evolution of its Bot Defense Platform\n\nRegardless of brand or industry, every customer interaction is critical to an organization's bottom line. Contact center leaders need to ensure they have the tools and technologies in place to meet and exceed expectations. While it can be daunting, it often doesn't require a complete overhaul of contact center operations but rather, looking for incremental opportunities to integrate AI capabilities into existing workflows. For example, by integrating powerful Emotion AI and Conversation AI, agents can receive real-time guidance to improve their performance, while still prioritizing the human touch for a better overall customer experience.",

        "body": "In the cryptocurrency space, Bitcoin is a strong trailblazer because of its decentralized structure, limited supply, and wide use. Bitcoin continues to show its endurance in the face of sporadic market changes, reaffirming its status as a top crypto to invest in.\n\nAs we gear up for 2024, the spotlight is on cryptocurrencies with solid fundamentals and innovative approaches. Here, we delve into the compelling narratives of Bitcoin, Borroe Finance ($ROE), Cardano, and Polkadot, all poised to drive portfolios to new heights.\n\n>>BUY $ROE TOKENS NOW<<\n\nBorroe Finance ($ROE) is like a pioneer, bringing a new way of doing traditional fundraising. The project uses advanced technologies like AI (that's artificial intelligence), secure blockchain tech, and easy payment methods.\n\nWith AI, Borroe Finance makes sure fundraising is safe and smooth, making people feel confident. The main part of what they do is a marketplace where you can trade special tokens (they call them NFTs) linked to future earnings. This cool idea makes a lively and open community, letting everyone join and help the platform grow.\n\nIf you have Borroe Finance ($ROE) tokens, you get special perks. You get to know about new sales first, can apply for funding again, and pay less fees for transactions. They also make sure everything is super safe by having experts check their technology.\n\nBorroe Finance is not just a platform; it's a community. People who have the tokens get to decide things by voting. This way, everyone feels like they own a piece of the platform and have a say in its future.\n\n>>BUY $ROE TOKENS NOW<<\n\nCardano stands out as a decentralized and public cryptocurrency and blockchain network, designed to provide a platform for smart contracts utilizing the Ouroboros proof-of-stake consensus algorithm. Pioneering the application of scientific principles in blockchain construction, ADA, the native cryptocurrency of Cardano, has been meticulously crafted to prioritize security, scalability, and interoperability in the development and execution of smart contracts and decentralized applications.\n\nCardano's multilayered architecture, which prioritizes high-level security, scalability, and interoperability, cleverly separates the settlement layer -- which oversees Ada transfers -- from the computing layer, which carries out smart contract execution. This division helps Cardano manage a wide variety of apps and transactions with efficiency since it improves the platform's overall flexibility and scalability. Due to its careful analysis of these fundamental ideas, Cardano is positioned as a cutting-edge blockchain network dedicated to expanding the field of decentralized technologies.\n\nPolkadot, made by one of Ethereum's co-founders, has a special way of creating a future where lots of computer networks (called blockchains) can work together. The key concept involves the use of \"parachains,\" which are independent blockchains that can coexist and share security via a main chain.\n\nThis setup makes it easy for different blockchains to talk to each other, letting data and assets move around freely. Polkadot is good for making decentralized apps and custom blockchains because it's flexible. The Substrate framework also helps developers by making it easier to create new and cool solutions.\n\nBorroe Finance's presale has ignited significant enthusiasm among investors and crypto enthusiasts. With its innovative fundraising strategy, focus on advanced AI technology, and dedication to community engagement, this presents an attractive investment opportunity. The inclusive nature of the presale, accommodating multiple payment options including top 5 cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC), Ethereum (ETH), and BNB, draws in a diverse range of investors to the project.\n\nAs it stands, Bitcoin, Polkadot, Cardano, and Borroe Finance are still some of the best coins to invest in in the cryptocurrency market. Because of its resilience, Bitcoin continues to draw interest from both traders and investors. Despite being relatively new, cardano and polkadot are also attracting the interest of traders. But Borroe Finance's unique NFT marketplace and creative financing options appear to be attracting many businesses and organizations.\n\nDisclosure: This is a sponsored press release.

        "title": "Where Will Nvidia Stock Be in 5 Years?",
        "body": "An investment of just $100 made in shares of Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) five years ago is now worth about $1,339, which is not surprising as the market has rewarded the chipmaker's impressive growth in revenue and earnings handsomely.\n\nA big chunk of those gains came in 2023, driven by a significant acceleration in Nvidia's growth thanks to the company's dominant position in the market for artificial intelligence (AI) chips and the recent recovery in the personal computer (PC) market, which kick-started the growth of its gaming business.\n\nEven better is that analysts forecast Nvidia will grow at a much faster pace in the next five years compared to the growth it has clocked in the previous half-decade. More specifically, consensus estimates forecast Nvidia's earnings to increase at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 103% over the next five years. That would be more than double the 48% CAGR Nvidia's bottom line has clocked in the past five years.\n\nA closer look at Nvidia's key growth drivers will tell us exactly why its bottom-line growth is expected to step on the gas over the next five years.\n\nNvidia was a much smaller company five years ago. It generated just under $12 billion in revenue in fiscal 2019 (which ended in January 2019 and coincided with 11 months of calendar year 2018). Gaming was Nvidia's biggest business segment at that time, accounting for 53% of its top line, while the data center business produced a quarter of its total revenue five years ago.\n\nThe situation has changed dramatically since then. The company now gets 80% of its revenue from selling graphics processing units (GPU) for the data center market. Gaming is now a smaller component, with just under 16% of Nvidia's fiscal 2024 third-quarter revenue. Still, Nvidia is the leader in both of these markets.\n\nAccording to third-party estimates, Nvidia controls more than 80% of the AI chip market, and it has a similar position in the market for discrete graphics cards that are deployed in PCs. The good news is that both of these markets are built for solid growth over the next five years. According to Nvidia's peer Advanced Micro Devices, the AI chip market could generate annual revenue of $400 billion in 2027, up nearly 10x from this year's $45 billion.\n\nOn the other hand, the gaming GPU market is forecast to grow at an annual pace of almost 34% through the end of 2028, according to Mordor Intelligence. The cloud gaming market, which is forecast to clock annual growth of 39% through 2028 and generate annual revenue of $23 billion at the end of the forecast period, could be another catalyst for Nvidia given the company's dominant position in this space.\n\nMore importantly, Nvidia has been taking steps to ensure that it remains the leading player in these markets by way of its product development moves. The company has already accelerated its product roadmap in AI chips, and it is reportedly going to make its next-generation gaming cards on a more advanced 3-nanometer (nm) process as compared to the current RTX 40-series processors that are made on a 5nm process.\n\nA smaller manufacturing node should ideally allow Nvidia's new gaming chips to pack more computing power and consume less electricity at the same time. This explains why Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing, from whom Nvidia sources its chips, claims that the 3nm chips could boost performance by 15% and lower power consumption by 30% as compared to the 5nm chips.\n\nAll this indicates that Nvidia is setting itself up to make the most of the impressive growth in the key end markets that contribute significantly to its business. That's why it won't be surprising to see the company's earnings indeed growing at a much faster pace over the next five years as compared to the past five.\n\nNvidia is on track to finish fiscal 2024 with revenue of $59 billion. That translates into a five-year revenue CAGR of 38% using the company's fiscal 2019 revenue of $11.7 billion as the base. For comparison, Nvidia's revenue growth is expected to be much faster over the next couple of years, as the following chart indicates.\n\nThe company is expected to generate almost $108 billion in revenue in fiscal 2026. That points toward a three-year revenue CAGR of 58% using the fiscal 2023 revenue of $27 billion as the base. If we assume that Nvidia's annual growth slows down to even 30% in the three fiscal years following fiscal 2026, its top line could hit $237 billion in fiscal 2029.\n\nNvidia has a five-year price-to-sales ratio of 20. Multiplying that with the company's projected revenue in fiscal 2029 would translate to a market cap of $4.75 trillion. That's nearly 4x of Nvidia's current market cap, indicating that a $100 investment in this hot tech stock could multiply once again in the next five years and make investors richer.\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month. The Stock Advisor service has more than tripled the return of S&P 500 since 2002*.\n\nHarsh Chauhan has no position in any of the stocks mentioned. The Motley Fool has positions in and recommends Advanced Micro Devices, Nvidia, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing.

        "title": "The Real Benefits of BIM Modeling Services",
        "body": "In the dynamic landscape of modern construction, Building Information Modeling (BIM) stands out as a transformative approach, redefining the way projects are planned, designed, and executed. At the heart of this revolution are BIM Modeling Services, playing a pivotal role in shaping the future of the construction industry. In this exploration, we delve into the intricacies of BIM modeling, showcasing how these services contribute to enhanced collaboration, efficiency, and innovation in construction projects.\n\nBuilding Information Modeling (BIM) is a collaborative process that utilizes digital representations of the physical and functional characteristics of a building or infrastructure. BIM Modeling Services leverage advanced software tools to create detailed 3D models enriched with data, offering a holistic view of a project throughout its lifecycle. This comprehensive approach transcends traditional 2D drafting, fostering a more integrated and intelligent way of working.\n\nCollaborative Information Sharing\n\nOne of the core principles of BIM Modeling Services is collaborative information sharing. These services enable multiple stakeholders, including architects, engineers, contractors, and facility managers, to work on a shared digital platform. This collaborative environment facilitates real-time data exchange, reducing errors, enhancing communication, and ensuring that all project contributors have access to the latest information.\n\nBIM Modeling Services begin with the creation of detailed 3D models that represent the physical aspects of a building or infrastructure project. These models provide stakeholders with a visual representation of the project, aiding in design validation, and improving decision-making throughout the project lifecycle.\n\nData-Rich Models for Analysis\n\nBeyond visual representation, BIM models are enriched with data, making them information-rich assets. BIM Modeling Services incorporate details such as material specifications, cost estimates, energy performance, and construction schedules into the digital models. This data-driven approach allows for in-depth analysis, aiding in accurate project planning, resource allocation, and performance evaluation.\n\nClash Detection for Conflict Resolution\n\nBIM Modeling Services include advanced clash detection capabilities. This feature identifies potential conflicts or clashes between different elements of the design, such as plumbing and electrical systems. By detecting and resolving clashes in the digital model, BIM minimizes the likelihood of on-site issues during construction, reducing costly rework and delays.\n\nBIM Modeling Services streamline project planning by providing a comprehensive view of the entire project from inception to completion. The ability to visualize and analyze various aspects of the project in the digital realm allows for more informed decision-making, leading to optimized project schedules and resource allocation.\n\nCost Savings Through Virtual Prototyping\n\nVirtual prototyping, enabled by BIM Modeling Services, allows for the creation of digital prototypes before physical construction begins. This virtual testing ground helps identify and rectify design flaws, reducing the likelihood of costly errors during the construction phase. The result is significant cost savings and improved overall project efficiency.\n\nBIM Modeling Services foster cross-disciplinary collaboration by breaking down silos between different project stakeholders. Architects, engineers, contractors, and facility managers can work collaboratively within the same digital environment, sharing insights and expertise. This collaborative approach leads to a more holistic understanding of the project and promotes collective problem-solving.\n\nImproved Communication with Stakeholders\n\nThe visual and data-rich nature of BIM models enhances communication with project stakeholders. BIM Modeling Services enable clear and concise communication by providing stakeholders with easily understandable visualizations and relevant data. This transparency fosters greater trust and alignment among all parties involved in the project.\n\nBIM Modeling Services contribute to sustainable construction practices by incorporating energy analysis into the digital models. This allows for the evaluation of the building's energy performance, helping designers and engineers make informed decisions to enhance energy efficiency and reduce environmental impact.\n\nLifecycle Management and Maintenance\n\nBIM models extend beyond the construction phase, encompassing the entire lifecycle of a building or infrastructure. BIM Modeling Services facilitate efficient facility management by providing a digital repository of information that includes maintenance schedules, equipment details, and renovation plans. This comprehensive approach ensures that buildings are managed sustainably throughout their existence.\n\nThe future of BIM Modeling Services involves the integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) for enhanced automation and decision support. AI algorithms can analyze vast amounts of data within BIM models, providing valuable insights for better decision-making in areas such as design optimization, risk management, and resource allocation.\n\nCloud-Based Collaboration\n\nCloud-based collaboration is becoming increasingly prevalent in BIM Modeling Services. This trend enables project stakeholders to access and work on BIM models from anywhere in the world, fostering global collaboration and real-time updates. Cloud-based solutions enhance flexibility and scalability in BIM workflows.\n\nThe adoption of cloud-based project management solutions has become a cornerstone of BIM Modeling Services. This trend enables seamless collaboration among dispersed teams by providing a centralized platform for sharing, updating, and accessing BIM models in real-time. Cloud-based solutions enhance communication, reduce delays, and empower project stakeholders with instant access to the latest project data.\n\nVirtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) Integration\n\nThe integration of Virtual Reality (VR) and Augmented Reality (AR) technologies is revolutionizing how BIM models are experienced and interacted with.

        "title": "Artificial Intelligence Applications for Identifying Key Features to Reduce Building Energy Consumption",
        "body": "The International Energy Agency (IEA) estimates that residential and commercial buildings consume 40% of global energy and emit 24% of CO2. A building's design parameters and location significantly impact its energy usage. Adjusting the building parameters and features in an optimum way helps to reduce energy usage and to build energy-efficient buildings. Hence, analyzing the impact of influencing factors is critical to reduce building energy usage.Towards this, artificial intelligence applications, such as Explainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) and machine learning (ML) identified the key building features to reduce building energy. This is done by analyzing the efficiencies of various building features that impact building energy consumption. For this, the relative importance of input features impacting commercial building energy usage is investigated. Also analyzed is the parametric analysis of the impact of input variables on residential building energy usage. Furthermore, the dependencies and relationships between the design variables of residential buildings were examined. Finally, the study analyzed the impact of location features on cooling energy usage in commercial buildings.For the purpose of energy consumption data analysis, three datasets, named the Commercial Building Energy Consumption Survey (CBECS) datasets gathered in 2012 and 2018, University of California Irvine (UCI) energy efficiency dataset, and Commercial Load Data (CLD) were utilized. For this, Python and WEKA were used. Random Forest, Linear Regression, Bayesian Networks, and Logistic Regression predicted energy consumption using datasets. Moreover, statistical tests, such as the Wilcoxon-rank sum test were analyzed for the significant differences between specific datasets. Shapash, a Python library, created the feature important graphs.The results indicated that cooling degree days are the most important feature in predicting cooling load with contribution values 34.29% (2018) and 19.68% (2012). Also, analyzing the impact of building parameters on energy usage indicated that 50% of overall height reduction achieves a reduction of heating load by 64.56% and cooling load by 57.47%. Also, the Wilcoxon-rank sum test indicated that the location of the building also impacts energy consumption with a 0.05 error margin. The proposed analysis is beneficial for real-world applications and energy-efficient building construction.",

        "title": "AI's Emerging Role in the Fight Against Intellectual Property Theft",
        "body": "In an era where knowledge and creativity are the cornerstones of progress, intellectual property (IP) is not just a legal asset but the very lifeblood that sustains business innovation, competitiveness, and growth. However, as we march deeper into the digital age, the specter of intellectual property theft looms larger than ever, posing a formidable challenge to industries worldwide.\n\nThis growing menace not only undermines the financial stability of businesses but also stifles innovation and erodes consumer trust. But there's a glimmer of hope on the horizon, and it's powered by artificial intelligence (AI). This blog delves into the emerging role of AI as a potent ally in the fight against intellectual property theft. We'll explore how this cutting-edge technology is transforming the landscape of IP protection, offering businesses a shield against the ever-evolving tactics of IP infringers.\n\nUnderstanding Intellectual Property Theft\n\nAt its core, intellectual property theft involves the unauthorized use, duplication, or distribution of copyrighted, patented, or trademarked material. This can range from the piracy of movies and music to the infringement of patents and trademarks. In essence, it's the act of stealing or exploiting someone else's creative or innovative work without permission.\n\nIntellectual property theft manifests in various forms, including:\n\nThe scale of intellectual property theft is staggering. According to the Global Brand Counterfeiting Report, the amount of global counterfeiting was projected to reach $1.82 trillion in 2020, impacting economies and businesses worldwide. In the United States, the total estimated cost of the theft of American intellectual property is estimated to increase by 36% in 2022.\n\nFor businesses, the challenge is twofold. First, there's the direct financial impact - lost sales, legal costs, and the expense of enforcing IP rights. Second, there's the intangible yet profound damage to brand integrity and customer trust.\n\nSeveral factors contribute to the rise in IP theft:\n\nThe Traditional Approach to IP Protection\n\nTraditionally, protecting intellectual property has been a mix of legal and technological strategies. Legal measures, including patents, copyrights, and trademarks, form the first line of defense. These legal tools not only define the rights of IP holders but also provide a framework for enforcement against infringement.\n\nHowever, legal remedies alone are not enough. Technological solutions like digital rights management (DRM), watermarking, and various anti-piracy tools have been employed to safeguard digital content. Physical products often rely on anti-counterfeiting measures like holograms, unique serial numbers, and tamper-evident packaging.\n\nDespite their effectiveness, these traditional approaches have limitations:\n\nThis gap between the sophistication of infringers and the ability of traditional methods to keep up has led to the exploration of more advanced solutions, chief among them being artificial intelligence.\n\nAI to the Rescue\n\nArtificial intelligence is stepping into the arena of IP protection with promising potential. AI, with its ability to process vast amounts of data and recognize patterns, can proactively identify potential IP infringements in ways that human monitoring cannot match.\n\nThis is how AI works in IP protection:\n\nIntegrating AI into IP Protection Strategies\n\nAs businesses grapple with the escalating challenge of IP theft, integrating AI into their protection strategies is becoming imperative. However, this integration should be a complement, not a replacement, for existing measures. Businesses should consider following these steps for incorporating AI into their protection strategies:\n\nThe Paradox of AI in IP Enforcement\n\nWhile AI offers groundbreaking solutions in the fight against IP theft, it's crucial to acknowledge its potential misuse as a tool for infringing on IP rights. This dual nature of AI poses unique challenges and necessitates a balanced approach.\n\nFraudsters can leverage AI to enable infringement in various ways:\n\nTo mitigate AI-enabled IP theft, businesses and governments should act on the following areas:\n\nThe challenge lies in leveraging AI for protection without stifling innovation. It's about finding that delicate balance where AI continues to drive progress while also safeguarding the fruits of creativity and innovation against misuse.\n\nEmbrace the Future with Cautious Optimism\n\nAs we've explored throughout this blog, AI stands at the forefront of a new era in intellectual property protection. Its ability to learn, adapt, and process information at unprecedented scales offers businesses a powerful tool to safeguard their most valuable assets. However, as with any powerful technology, AI presents both opportunities and challenges in the realm of IP rights.\n\nThe key takeaway for business leaders is the importance of embracing AI as part of a comprehensive IP protection strategy. By integrating AI with traditional methods, companies can enhance their ability to detect and prevent IP theft, staying one step ahead of infringers. At the same time, it's vital to remain vigilant about the potential misuse of AI for IP infringement and to participate actively in shaping the ethical and legal frameworks that govern its use.",

        "title": "GenAI Will Shape American Foreign Policy",
        "body": "(NewsUSA) - When it comes to generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), the United States government needs to adjust its mission and tradecraft to advance American interests, according to experts at the Special Competitive Studies Project (SCSP), a bipartisan nonprofit organization.\n\nDespite its current position as a global leader GenAI, the issue facing the United States is how to shape GenAI's global use and function so that it reinforces these interests, according to a new report from SCSP.\n\nThe authors outline recommendations for a new model of statecraft and the creation of global institutions to chart a way for GenAI to be used for good, and to put guardrails in place to protect against negative consequences.\n\nSCSP advises the U.S. government to bring together different departments, authorities, talents, and tools, and to establish domestic regulatory policies that also reflect a global context, to work alongside like-minded allies, but not to disadvantage the U.S. private sector in global competition.\n\nPlatforms Statecraft. A platform approach to foreign policy and GenAI should include an updated mission with competition around technology platforms, as well as joint efforts across government agencies, modernization, and sub-national diplomacy to ensure that U.S. policy is tied into domestic innovation at the state and local levels.\n\nNew Tools. The adoption of GenAI tools by the Department of State will change the way workforces do their jobs, but these high-tech tools do not replace decision-making by policy experts; instead, GenAI tools provide additional, and potentially novel, recommendations and solutions based on an amount of information that no one human can process as quickly as a machine. Agency-wide programs to leverage GenAI could include a centralized GenAI infrastructure, a tailored GenAI system to handle sensitive information, and training policy makers to understand how GI works and where human oversight is needed.\n\nGlobal Frameworks. To manage GenAI as a geopolitical and transnational issue, SCSP recommends creating a leaders-level forum to bring together key nations and address the highest-level risks that GenAI may pose; a leaders-level agenda item on GenAI in bilateral dialogues between the U.S. and the People's Republic of Chine to help manage strategic stability risks; and a working-level forum for like-minded national to explore positive use cases around GenAI and mitigate against practical challenges.\n\nFor more information, visit scsp.ai.",

Welcome to the FactSet Q1 Earnings Call. (Operator Instructions) Please be advised that today's conference is being recorded.\n\nI would now like to hand the conference over to your speaker today, Ali Van Nes, SVP IR. Please go ahead.\n\nAlexandra van Nes\n\nThank you, and good morning, everyone. Welcome to FactSet's First Fiscal Quarter 2024 Earnings Call. Before we begin, the slides we reference during this presentation can be found through the webcast on the Investor Relations section of our website at factset.com and are currently available on our website. A replay of today's call will be available via phone and on our website.\n\nAfter our prepared remarks, we will open the call to questions from investors. The call is scheduled to last for 1 hour. (Operator Instructions)\n\nBefore we discuss our results, I encourage all listeners to review the legal notice on Slide 2, which explains the risks of forward-looking statements and the use of non-GAAP financial measures.\n\nAdditionally, please refer to our Forms 10-K and 10-Q for a discussion of risk factors that could cause actual results to differ materially from those forward-looking statements.\n\nOur slide presentation and discussions on this call will include certain non-GAAP financial measures. For such measures, reconciliations to the most directly comparable GAAP measures are in the appendix to the presentation and in our earnings release issued earlier today.\n\nJoining me today are Phil Snow, Chief Executive Officer; and Linda Huber, Chief Financial Officer. We will also be joined by Helen Shan, Chief Revenue Officer; and Kristy Karnovsky, Chief Product Officer, for the Q&A portion of today's call.\n\nI will now turn the discussion over to Phil Snow.\n\nFrederick Philip Snow\n\nThank you, Ali, and good morning, everyone. Thanks for joining us today. In the first quarter, we grew organic ASV plus professional services by 7.1% year-over-year, delivering adjusted diluted EPS of $4.12 and an adjusted operating margin of 37.6%.\n\nThis quarter, we closed 2 marquee deals that serve as proof points for our long-term strategy even as macro conditions remain challenging. The first was a large wealth win at a major U.S. firm where we displaced a competitor. As a result of this deal, our user count increased by more than 17,000 seats. The second was a significant trading win at one of the largest U.S. asset managers, highlighting the strength of our open platform and portfolio life cycle solutions.\n\nWe ended this quarter with almost 8,000 clients and 24 net new logos. ASV retention remained greater than 95% and client retention was 90%. Nevertheless, since our last earnings call in September, sales cycles have continued to lengthen, challenging our near-term forecast. Client budgets remain restricted due to lower deal-making volume, layoffs and geopolitical uncertainty. So while the recent Federal Reserve commentary may be positive for the macro environment, we are revising our fiscal 2024 top line guidance to reflect ASV growth of $110 million to $150 million or 6% growth at the midpoint.\n\nWe will also be implementing a cost-reduction program in the second quarter of FY '24. This program will support our investments in multiyear initiatives, such as deep sector and real time, and allow us to accelerate our AI strategic investments. We expect to review variable costs and personnel-related costs with the goal of delivering adjusted operating margin within our original guidance range of 36.3% to 36.7%. Linda will say more about this later in the call.\n\nTurning now to our performance by region. Growth this quarter was driven mainly by the large wealth win in the Americas as well as solid demand for Data Solutions, offsetting weaker results in other parts of the business.\n\nAmericas ASV growth accelerated 88 basis points over the prior quarter to 7.9%, where outside of wealth, lower net hiring and banking and asset managers led to softer demand for workstations compared with a year ago.\n\nIn EMEA, organic ASV growth decelerated to 5.4%, mainly due to a slowdown in our core buy-side markets in the U.K. and France. Our clients are experiencing reduced revenues and margin pressures, which led to delays in planned projects and slower sales cycles. Higher demand for Data Solutions partially offset these headwinds.\n\nIn Asia Pac, we delivered organic ASV growth of 8%, driven by solid gains with asset owners, partially offset by seasonal banking layoffs.\n\nFrom a firm type perspective, wealth accelerated the most compared with last quarter due to the marquee deal I mentioned earlier. While pipeline visibility remains limited until the broader market recovers some momentum, ongoing C-suite conversations at several firms point to continued opportunity to displace wealth competitors.\n\nFor dealmakers, we added new logos in private equity and corporates, but not at the rate we saw last year. Churn and lower seasonal hiring led to erosion in banking. On the institutional buy side, cost cutting and headcount reductions at institutional asset managers caused a deceleration in workstation sales. For asset owners and hedge funds, elongated sales cycles further dampened results.\n\nFinally, new business and sales of Data Solutions drove growth with partners across regions. Overall, retention was flat in the first quarter with the positive effect of the fiscal 2023 price increase, partially offset by higher cancels and erosion.\n\nOver FactSet's 45-year history, new product releases have driven our strong market position. These included Universal Screening in 1986, Portfolio Analytics in 1995 and FactSet Fundamentals in 2008. Last week, we added to this list with the beta release of FactSet Mercury, our new conversational AI interface.\n\nFactSet Mercury is a large language model-based knowledge agent. It uses natural language to request company information, provide supporting context and also suggest next steps. Users can also ask for any chart using natural language which is then prepared and delivered into Microsoft Office.\n\nFactSet Mercury is part of FactSet Explorer, a product preview program. We are working on Explorer with our leading banking clients and will soon offer it to institutional buy side and wealth clients. Also, last quarter, we released AI-enhanced transcript highlights and news summaries, which received positive reviews from our users. These are just the first of many workflows that will use generative AI to improve our clients' efficiency.\n\nAnd along with these AI initiatives, work continues on deep sector and real time, the wealth workstation and the portfolio life cycle. Each of these multiyear investments is driving growth, including last quarter's big wins in banking and asset management.\n\nFinally, the private credit market is growing fast and is almost the size of the leveraged loan market. It is well served by both our Data Solutions and our middle office analytics. For example, Cobalt can be used for private credit fund portfolio monitoring. We can also extend our fixed income capabilities to private credit risk assessments, benchmarking and performance monitoring.\n\nIn summary, I remain confident in our strategy and the health of our business, and I am optimistic about the opportunity ahead of us. Demand for our high-value products remain strong, demonstrated by our marquee wins this quarter and increased interest from global firms consolidating to FactSet's open platform.\n\nI'll now turn it over to Linda to discuss our first quarter performance in more detail.\n\nLinda S. Huber\n\nThanks, Phil, and hello to everyone. As you've seen from our press release this morning, Q1 organic ASV and revenue growth exceeded 7%. I will now share additional details on our fiscal first quarter performance. As Ali noted, a reconciliation of our adjusted metrics compared to GAAP is included at the end of our press release.\n\nFirst, a few observations on macro conditions. Last Wednesday, the Federal Reserve decided to hold rates constant and signaled three 0.25-point rate cuts next year. Inflation has eased, but remains higher than the Fed's 2% target. Equities rallied on the news as rates fell across the yield curve. While this news was helpful, it will take time for capital markets and deal activity to pick up. As Phil mentioned, we expect that market recovery will come later than we anticipated in our September fiscal year 2024 guidance.\n\nFor the quarter, GAAP revenue increased 7% to $542 million. Organic revenue, which excludes any impact from acquisitions and dispositions over the last 12 months and foreign exchange movements, increased 7% to $541 million, due to higher wealth sales and increased sales of data. For our geographic segments, organic revenues grew by 8% in the Americas, almost 6% in EMEA and 8% in Asia Pacific.\n\nTurning now to expenses. GAAP operating expenses increased 6% year-over-year to $353 million, driven by higher employee expense, technology costs and royalties. Compared to the previous year, GAAP operating margin increased by approximately 80 basis points to 35%. This was due to a decrease in professional fees, personnel and facilities costs, partially offset by higher technology-related expenses.\n\nOn an adjusted basis, operating expenses grew 9%, primarily driven by technology expense, which increased 28% year-over-year. We've continued to invest in technology to drive growth with technology costs now representing about 9% of revenue, consistent with our medium-term outlook.\n\nEmployee expense grew 8% year-over-year, primarily due to increased salaries for existing employees.\n\nThird-party data content costs increased 12% due to lapping a onetime accrual release in the first quarter of fiscal 2023 as well as higher variable fee expenses.\n\nFinally, our continued efforts to rightsize our real estate footprint resulted in a 1% decrease in year-over-year facilities expenses.\n\nLooking at margin. Adjusted operating margin decreased by 70 basis points to 37.6%, driven by the previously mentioned higher technology expenses, partially offset by lower facilities, professional services and T&E expenses. As always, you'll find an expense walk from revenue to adjusted operating income in the appendix of today's earnings presentation.\n\nAs a percent of revenue, our cost of services was about 140 basis points higher than last year on a GAAP basis and about 220 basis points higher on an adjusted basis, largely due to technology and personnel costs. And SG&A as a percentage of revenue was 230 basis points lower year-over-year on a GAAP basis and about 150 basis points lower on an adjusted basis. This was due to decreases in professional fees, facilities expenses and personnel expenses.\n\nTurning now to tax. Our tax rate for the quarter was 15.2% compared to last year's rate of 13.4%. This increase was primarily due to lower benefits related to stock option exercises and restricted stock vesting. The remainder of the increase was due to higher pretax income and a higher foreign tax rate, partially offset by foreign tax credits.\n\nTurning now to EPS. GAAP EPS increased 9.1% to $3.84 this quarter versus $3.52 in the prior year. This was driven by higher revenue and margin expansion, partially offset by a higher tax rate. On an adjusted basis, EPS increased 3.3% to $4.12, driven by revenue growth, partially offset by margin compression and a higher tax rate. EBITDA increased to $219 million, up 9.3% year-over-year, due to higher net income and higher income tax add-backs.\n\nAnd finally, free cash flow, which we define as cash generated from operations less capital spending, was $139 million through the quarter, an increase of 56% over the same period last year. This was driven by significantly higher net cash from operating activities, which was nearly $50 million greater year-over-year due to higher cash collections.\n\nTurning to share repurchases. For the quarter, we repurchased 135,950 shares for $59.9 million at an average price of $440.67. We intend to continue our share repurchases during fiscal 2024 with a target of $250 million of purchases spread ratably throughout the year.\n\nWe remain disciplined in our buyback program and committed to returning long-term value to our shareholders. Combining our dividends and share repurchases, we returned $378.6 million to our shareholders over the last 12 months. As a reminder, we also increased our dividend by 10% to $0.98 per share in the third quarter of fiscal 2023.\n\nAnd finally, turning to our revised guidance for fiscal 2024. As Phil mentioned earlier, we expect that the market recovery will happen later in the year than anticipated when we first gave guidance for fiscal 2024. Given this revised view, we are guiding to incremental organic ASV plus professional services growth of $110 million to $150 million, reflecting 6% growth at the midpoint, down from our original 7% growth guidance.\n\nGiven the headwinds in ASV and the lagged timing of ASV in the first half of the fiscal year, we are lowering our expected revenue range to $2.2 billion to $2.21 billion. At the midpoint, revenue growth is also expected to be approximately 6%, a deceleration of about 75 basis points from our previously issued guidance.\n\nWe've reduced our GAAP operating margin guidance to 32.5% to 33%, which is down from 33.1% to 33.5%. However, it should be noted that we have not changed our adjusted operating margin guidance of 36.3% to 36.7%. At the midpoint, this provides 30 basis points of continued margin expansion. While we have already met our adjusted operating margin medium-term outlook of 36%, we are committed to balancing continued sustainable margin expansion with investments to drive top line growth.\n\nIt is also worth noting that our effective tax rate guidance has been reduced by 50 basis points to 16.5% to 17.5%. And finally, adjusted EPS is expected to range from $15.60 to $16, which represents 7.8% growth at the midpoint and a $0.10 reduction from guidance at the midpoint.\n\nAs Phil mentioned, we continued to execute disciplined expense management to support strategic investment to grow our top line. Accordingly, we expect to take a $10 million to $15 million charge in the second quarter of fiscal 2024. Focus areas for expense reduction include both variable and personnel-related costs.\n\nDespite the uncertain environment, we remain confident in our long-term growth. We have a diverse pipeline and are seeing improved price realization and increased interest in our products. In addition, our enterprise contracts and diverse end markets provide us with downside protection in an uncertain market. As a result, we are confident that we are positioned well for the future.\n\nWe are now ready for your questions. Operator?\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our first question comes from the line of Seth Weber from Wells Fargo.\n\nSeth Robert Weber\n\nI guess I just wanted to ask -- get a little bit more clarity on the updated outlook. Can you just talk about whether deals are falling out of the pipeline? Are deal sizes getting smaller? Any pressure on the pricing side? Or do you really feel like this is all just kind of getting pushed to the right just while your customers try to navigate the macro environment?\n\nFrederick Philip Snow\n\nSeth, thanks. It's Phil. I'm going to say a few words, and then I'm sure Helen has more detail. So I think, clearly, we had a good Q1. We had a great win there on the wealth side. Q2 looks to be a little bit weaker than we originally anticipated. And it's always hard to predict when market sentiment is going to turn around, essentially.\n\nSo we're still very optimistic about Q4. And as usual, we have a tale of two halves. So I think we have the product, the strategy, the competitive positioning to really do well, but we are facing some headwinds in the market just in terms of clients, their budgets. Obviously, they're looking very closely at their own headcount.\n\nHelen L. Shan\n\nYes. And maybe I can add a little bit to that. Thanks for the question. So as Phil just said, I do think that the continued demand for our middle office offering and data and middle office services has really been strong, and similarly for data feeds. Right now, the total cost of ownership has been the differentiator for us. But there are the exogenous events that are impacting budgets and timing and hiring.\n\nSo what changed from 90 days ago? Let me try to break that down a bit for you. I would look at around 40 basis points coming from the impact from pricing pressures and lower price realization. We definitely see that being a part of the dynamic that's playing out. We're seeing some impact from higher erosion. That's about 30-some basis points.\n\nAnd then 25 basis points coming from what we view as delayed decisions in spend. We're seeing more of that coming into the fourth quarter. And from that perspective, that makes it a little bit tougher to gauge exactly when that will come to fruition.\n\nWe have not seen a lot of fallout. So that again helps us think about the strength of our business, but not necessarily the timing of it.\n\nIf you think about the reduction by firm type, the way we look at it is about half of it will come from dealmakers, which is largely banking. And we can see right now weaker net hires. But it's very difficult to tell until we get into the second half, as you know, for seasonal hiring.\n\nFrom the buy side, that's about 25% of our total. There, we're seeing a bit of the higher erosion due to cost realization -- cost rationalization rather, and also delayed decisions. We're actually seeing good opportunities in the 6-plus figure, but those take longer to come about.\n\nAnd then lastly on wealth strength. Like was mentioned, very strong on the wealth side, of a great win this quarter. But if I take a look at what else is happening there, is that we're seeing some slowdown in adviser hiring and then some losses on smaller firms.\n\nWe still see a path to hit the higher end of our revised range, which would put us back into the midpoint, things such as higher conviction on the improvement in the capital markets, so that we would see more investments that are in flight go back into technology; higher investment banking flow, that we think would drive higher seasonal hiring. And then we've got a number of large competitive opportunities in our pipeline, all in that 6- and 7-figure deal range. And those can change and determine whether or not we hit the high end as well.\n\nSo hopefully, that gives you a sense of what drives the delta between our guidance.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Toni Kaplan from Morgan Stanley.\n\nToni Michele Kaplan\n\nI was hoping you could talk a little bit about the price increase that you're implementing for the upcoming calendar year. I know, Helen, you just mentioned some difficulties in passing through price. But I guess, what's the sort of list price increase, and what your expectation is for how that flows through?\n\nHelen L. Shan\n\nYes, sure. Thank you, Toni. You're right. We -- the Americas is done on Jan 1. And then our international, we'll see that come through in April.\n\nSo interestingly, the actual rate cards, we have not increased. What we do is we have an annual price increase based off of our contracts. And quite frankly, up until now, we've seen everything go through pretty well. In other words, clients are not pushing back on the price increase per se. They understand it. They understand the improvements we've made and the enhancements we made.\n\nThe issue that we have a little bit more of is clients are taking the opportunity then to perhaps go through a review of their list, so we see some erosion that comes from -- as a result. And also from a price realization perspective, so in other words, we're seeing some down shift. We have to kind of approve deals that are a bit lower on our price realization, about 1 point lower than we saw in Q4, for example, and that's driving some of that delta.\n\nSo we expect to have to continue to be competitive, especially on new deals. And -- but the actual annual price increase so far has been received pretty much in line with what we've seen in the past.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Alex Kramm from UBS.\n\nAlexander Kramm\n\nMaybe a little bit too short-term focus here. But talking about the second quarter a little bit more in detail, you said that was the biggest change of your outlook. So when I look at last year, I think you added $54 million in the quarter organically, and I think $31 million of that was pricing. So are you basically saying pricing should be fairly consistent, but then you may actually have a negative elsewhere? Or how would you think about the second quarter specifically? Because I know there's a lot of things going on, including at my firm.\n\nHelen L. Shan\n\nAlex, it's Helen. Thanks for your question, and thanks for the specifics. So you've hit the nail on the head on a number of your points. So yes, last year, we had a very strong Q2. And so this year, while we've not changed our rate card, the actual annual price increase is a little bit lower than last year. So that is part of the reason, so you're spot on there.\n\nThe other is that we do know or anticipated a couple of material headwinds. One is the impact of the acquisition of Credit Suisse by UBS and the downsizing that occur there. Now we might be a little bit conservative there, but that's going to have a pretty material impact to our growth year-over-year. And that's where the Q2, we will see a much more weak Q2 growth rate.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Faiza Alwy from Deutsche Bank.\n\nFaiza Alwy\n\nI wanted to follow up on the cost savings that you mentioned. So maybe, Linda, can you talk a little bit more about the timing of those savings and how we should think about that as we go through the year? And maybe in general, sort of how do you think about just your flexibility as it relates to EPS and flexibility around level of investments and what your priorities are?\n\nLinda S. Huber\n\nFaiza, yes, we are thinking through what it means to have at the midpoint of $15 million reduction in revenue. So obviously, we would like to offset that, and it is our intention to hold adjusted operating margin where we said at about 36.5% midpoint. So we've got to adjust our expenses. We've talked about taking a charge, which we will have more details on in the second quarter earnings call. So that's at the half year mark, if you will.\n\nSo we're shooting for about $30 million in cost cuts. And we're looking at $10-ish or so million of cost cuts. The first thing you do is look at your variable costs. The easiest one is T&E, so we're looking at sort of $1 million to $2 million of a cut there. Professional services is another one we're looking at, call that $3 million to $4 million. So call that bucket sort of $5 million in total.\n\nAnd then we're looking also at our bonus calculation. So we've just taken our guidance down a bit, and we would expect that our bonus pool will come down a bit as well. Maybe about $5-ish million, but we don't know until we get to the end of the year. So that would be about a total of $10 million.\n\nAnd then we've talked about a $10 million to $15 million charge, which would probably lean more toward personnel and headcount reduction thoughts. We're working through that right now. We have not made any final decisions on that.\n\nAnd of course, that process has to be handled very, very carefully with an eye toward holding our investment funding, which is incredibly important to us, particularly given AI, which we'll be talking about in a bit. But we want to make sure that we bring our expenses back into line with our revenues.\n\nNow if you look at our bucket, we had talked before about -- if you look at our third-party data costs, they're up a bit in the first quarter because we lapped a really good audit release last year, but those will be about flat for this year.\n\nAnd if you look at our real estate costs, we've taken pretty close to $90 million in charges to rightsize our real estate footprint. So on that one, those costs will actually be flat to down a bit year-over-year.\n\nTechnology costs are going up. We've talked a lot about that. This is a technology company. And 3 big drivers for the tech costs, amortization coming through because we're building more of our software, as we've talked about; also more cloud expense; and also more third-party software purchases.\n\nFootnote there on cloud expense. Please watch that carefully. If Kristy and the team are successful with what they're trying to do for AI, cloud expense may go up. We have to watch that carefully, but that's an important area of investment for us. So we'll keep our eyes on that.\n\nWhich leaves people, which is about 65% of our expense base. So we're going to have to make sure we've got everyone in the right place for what we're trying to do going forward. And I think that probably would provide about enough detail.\n\nIn terms of the ramp for expenses. We put up $338 million for the first quarter. We would expect that to jump up to the neighborhood of $350 million for the second quarter. And then as a result of the charge, sort of flatten out through the rest of the year. And yes, our margin tends to be a bit higher in the first quarter. We would see it might come off a bit as we move through the year, so the sort of normal trend that you see at FactSet.\n\nSo that's a lot of information. I hope that's helpful. And really appreciate your question, Faiza.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) our next question comes from the line of Manav Patnaik from Barclays.\n\nManav Shiv Patnaik\n\nI just wanted to follow up on kind of the macro discussion. Usually, when you have these times of cost pressures, budget pressures, et cetera, there's a lot of talk around vendor consolidation as well. So I was just hoping, are you seeing any opportunities in terms of maybe winning business from the lower end? Or maybe there's some M&A opportunities because of that? Just hoping you could address that.\n\nFrederick Philip Snow\n\nManav, thanks for the question. It's Phil. We certainly are seeing opportunity. So as we go through these periods of market uncertainty, it's always a great opportunity for FactSet to work with our clients who typically want to do more with us and trust us. So that's become an even more sophisticated conversation as our product suite has expanded.\n\nAnd just in the last few weeks, I've heard a couple of very encouraging situations where it just feels like there's more of a top-down push now at the bigger clients to really save -- to drive cost savings in our direction. So that is encouraging to me.\n\nI think at some firms, there was still a bit of choice given to users. But we are an anchor partner of choice for our clients based on our strategy. And our open platform, our investments in generative AI and our approach there is lending really well. So I just feel more optimistic than I have in a long time about the long-term prospects of FactSet and our competitive position.\n\nI'm happy to go through this firm type by firm type, either on the call today or some other time with you. But overall, I think it's just a timing thing for us and getting through this period of uncertainty in the markets, and I think then, we're in really good shape.\n\nHelen L. Shan\n\nMaybe I can just add a little bit, Manav, just along what Phil just said. So like he was talking about, clients are going through rightsizing exercises, that's been happening for several quarters.\n\nAnd most clients, their budgets are more flat. But what they're being asked is to provide more sophisticated tools and reporting to their clients, and yet they have not enough people or dollars; or their current technology and processes, some of which can be internal, just can't scale. And that's why we're so well positioned on that front. And that's why also from an open platform perspective, you can do replacement pieces, not need the entire piece of higher workflow replace, but pieces, and that's worked into our advantage as well.\n\nSo that really goes to what Phil was just talking about, which is there's a lot of good activity and timing is really the question because of how complex they are.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Heather Balsky from Bank of America.\n\nHeather Nicole Balsky\n\nI was just hoping you could talk a little bit about how you're thinking first half versus second half and the different drivers between the two, I guess, parts of the year. Prior -- I guess, last earnings, you kind of had us think about the recovery into the back half. It sounds like it's maybe pushed out a bit. But when do you see capital markets come back? Kind of what's baked into the first half versus the second half?\n\nLinda S. Huber\n\nHeather, it's Linda. I actually listened to an interview with Brian Moynihan on the way up this morning. So maybe we'll quote you back your own firm's information here.\n\nI think the question is the timing of the turn. And I don't think anyone can predict that particularly clearly. If they can, they should be of course running a hedge fund. But in any case, we have thought this might come a little bit sooner. What we're trying to say is that the turn is going to come a little bit later in the year than we had thought.\n\nIt should be noted that investment banking and banking hiring is a lagging indicator, okay? So we've had 500 basis points of interest rate increases. Times got tougher, and so hiring is in fact a lagging indicator. There is a view that I also heard this morning, not from your boss, that Jay Powell shot the bears last week.\n\nSo how long will it take for capital markets to come back? If you speak to various institutions, they're saying they're seeing much greater activity right now. The 10-year this morning was at 3.9%, which beats the heck out of 5%. So we would expect that things will turn up. How quickly will that happen? Very difficult to say. So we're trying to be realistic about what we think about the pacing of that turn.\n\nBut we do -- particularly with the Fed announcement last week, we do think that it is coming. It just may take a bit longer than we thought. And there's a lot of focus on AI. We have incredible conversations going on with our clients, and we'll be speaking more about that as others might want to ask about it. But we do see the turn coming, it's just a question of when. So I hope that makes things a bit clearer, but we appreciate your boss' interview this morning.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) our next question comes from the line of Shlomo Rosenbaum from Stifel.\n\nShlomo H. Rosenbaum\n\nLinda, specifically for you. You talked about what you're doing in terms of cost cutting. But I was wondering, just as I look at various levers that might still be available, when I think about it, like how much can you gain efficiency by AI? I think a lot of the AI you're talking about are for clients. What about the company's own ability to influence some AI internally? I hear from other companies that they can gain efficiency that way.\n\nAnd then just again, the Centers of Excellence, you've got 68% of headcount over there. Is that kind of peaked out over there? Or is that another lever that can continue to be pushed? And where does that max?\n\nLinda S. Huber\n\nYes. Shlomo, I'll let Phil talk a little bit about how far we can go with the Centers of Excellence. But you're right, we have good representation in those Centers of Excellence, and that's working really, really well for us.\n\nWe do have our thoughts on efficiency coming from gen AI. Probably a little bit premature to talk about that. We're going to focus on the client side first. And that's really where we're looking hardest right now. But efficiency for engineers is really important, efficiency for our help desk kind of function is very, very important. And in future calls, we'll talk more about that.\n\nShlomo, to answer a question you didn't ask. We did want to thank you for your noting that we had improved free cash flow and that we collected about $50 million more in cash collections than we did in the previous period last year.\n\nSo in addition to our giant macro calls that we have to make, we also have to make sure we're collecting our cash appropriately. So I appreciate your note on that, but I'm going to turn it over to Phil on CoEs and also on the Gen AI opportunity for ourselves. Phil?\n\nFrederick Philip Snow\n\nThanks, Shlomo. Yes. So I think there are 3 good buckets of cost opportunity internally for generative AI. One is engineering. So we have a lot of engineers at FactSet, and we've successfully piloted GitHub Copilot with a number of groups. And I think we're deploying that more broadly now. So like other firms, we're seeing great efficiency just in terms of the amount of code that someone can produce in the same amount of time. So that is a good opportunity for us.\n\nOn the content collection side, there's also a good opportunity. And over the decades, we have continued to automate more and more of content collection. So this is just a bit of an inflection point. But I was in India a couple of months ago and sat down with a number of teams, and all of them were able to demonstrate to me in some way, shape or form really good efficiency that they could get from collecting all kinds of different databases.\n\nAnd then on the sales front, similarly, I sat down with someone on our help desk. And we have a copilot for them, which is really good about generating a code that a user might want. And 50% of our help desk calls tend to be coding calls, so you can imagine that, that's a great efficiency.\n\nSo the question for us and for any other firm, frankly, if you ask anyone about this, is whether or not you have that efficiency go through to margin or if you use it in other ways, right? So we have a long list of things we'd like to do on the product side. So we're still, a, evaluating how much efficiency we can get and how we'd want to spend that money. Any real impact from those three things, I wouldn't expect to see until FY '25, next fiscal year. But we might be able to recognize some of it in -- like later in the second half of this year.\n\nThe Centers of Excellence, we have great employees there. I think the question is, just can you continue to go up the value chain in terms of what you do in those locations? So we're always evaluating our people and location strategy. And I think we've all learned in the last 3 years that there are even more options open to us than there might have been in the past.\n\nSo overall, I'm very optimistic about what we can continue to do to drive efficiency and drive the top line through more product.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) our next question comes from the line of Andrew Nicholas from William Blair.\n\nAndrew Owen Nicholas\n\nI wanted to ask on kind of the M&A opportunity set and your appetite there. It sounds like with the market -- or I would expect the market being a little bit choppier in the end markets, or client budgets rather being a bit harder to pin down, that you might be seeing maybe some more opportunities or some more reasonable multiples for potential acquisitions. So if you could touch on that.\n\nAnd then maybe kind of bigger picture on the same vein. Do you think that AI and its ability to drive content collection -- I think, Phil, you said it reached an inflection point. Does that have an impact on potential multiples as you acquire data assets? Are they easier to get? Are they more valuable now? Just kind of like a bigger-picture question on the value of data assets.\n\nFrederick Philip Snow\n\nYes, thank you. There's a lot in there. So on the M&A front, the three buckets that we continue to spend time on are wealth, wealth technology, private markets and filling out -- continuing to fill out the portfolio life cycle. So those are the three areas of higher interest. We do look at other interesting content assets.\n\nAnd yes, your instincts are right. The market is beginning to thaw a little bit. I think a lot of sponsors are beginning to bring assets to market as they need to show some returns to their clients. I don't know about the multiples coming down part, that's still to be determined.\n\nBut we're in a much better position than we were 6 months ago just because we've executed very well on the CUSIP acquisition and effectively gotten our leverage down to the range that we said that we would. We did what we said we were going to do. So we're active. We're looking at tons of stuff.\n\nOn the AI front, I mean, the -- I guess I'll answer it this way. The -- I think the winners in artificial intelligence are going to be people that own the data, right? So we're in a great position there because we have a ton of data that we collect ourselves. We obviously have a lot of third parties that contribute data into our ecosystem, and we connect that well. That's the real value there. And then clients are also trusting us with their data.\n\nSo potentially, data -- the price of data assets may go up, but also it might be easier for some newer firms to collect data. Now newer firms that have data are going to need, very often, platforms like FactSet to monetize that. It's hard to go into a bigger bank or a bigger asset management as a small company and get their attention and get through all of the different things that you need to get through to have that sale.\n\nSo we're in a great position here. And yes, we're actively looking at what's available in the market.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of George Tong from Goldman Sachs.\n\nKeen Fai Tong\n\nYou talked about restructuring to take out variable and personnel-related costs. Can you elaborate on which parts of the business this is affecting? So how much of this is coming from the desktop business, wealth business, data feeds, et cetera? And how these cost actions are spread out geographically? Whether the actions are more concentrated in certain parts of the world versus others?\n\nLinda S. Huber\n\nYes. George, it's Linda. We're not going to talk about headcount reductions via firm types. The main reason being that we haven't made our full decisions yet. We're looking to put our investments toward our higher-value and our emerging opportunities. And obviously, we're looking really closely at products that we may have had for a while or opportunities that maybe have not lived up to everything that we had hoped for them.\n\nAlso in terms of where that headcount might come from, obviously, we have to look hard at our onshore locations to make sure we're getting the best use out of our resources there. But again, all this is in progress right now, and we'll have a little bit more information as we go into the Q2 earnings call. But we haven't made those decisions yet. And I don't think we're going to give that degree of granularity even when we get to that time.\n\nWe're looking to take out $10 million to $15 million on cost. We're going to do it very thoughtfully. Senior management of the firm is looking at this with great caution to make sure that we're really thoughtful about what we're doing. This doesn't come easily to us, so we want to take the time and get it right. And I don't think we're going to go into too much more detail than that.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Craig Huber from Huber Research Partners, LLC.\n\nCraig Anthony Huber\n\nI was hoping you could give a little more clarity on the workflow breakdown in the quarter year-over-year by client type, dealmakers, partners, wealth and institutional buy side. And also curious are you basically assuming the second half of the year, which areas pick up significantly versus what we've seen in the first half?\n\nFrederick Philip Snow\n\nWell, we won't give exact numbers. But what I can say is that banking was probably affected the most. And I think you saw that in our press release, right? We saw, I think, much weaker hiring or more churn on the banking side than we did last year.\n\nOn the asset management side, things came down a little bit, not dreadfully. We did see definitely weaker penetration in the front office. So we've begun to see the buy-side clients, I think, reduce headcount a little bit more than they have in the past. But overall, the growth rates of asset management, asset owners and hedge funds didn't come down dramatically.\n\nWealth went up quite a bit because of that big deal we had in Q1. And then some of the smaller parts of our business, like private equity, venture capital and corporations in an environment like this, we did add new logos in both of those areas, but not at the rate that we might have had in previous years. So hopefully, that helps.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Kelsey Zhu from Autonomous.\n\nWenting Zhu\n\nSo on wealth, I think you previously talked about an acceleration of growth in FY '24 and the general expectations of expanding share and expanding TAM. Obviously, we've seen a large win this quarter, but I was wondering if you can tell us a little bit more about the key drivers and strategy behind that acceleration of growth.\n\nYou've also talked about expanding into workflows outside of the Advisory Dashboard, so I was wondering if you can give us an update on that as well.\n\nHelen L. Shan\n\nKelsey, it's Helen. Thanks for your question. Let me try to get to it. So when we think about wealth, as we mentioned, we had a very good win this quarter that helps us a lot. And so when we think about what wealth clients are trying to do right now, is that they are looking really to improve and modernize their platform. This started with a lot of the large wealth firms, as you know. And now we're seeing that now with the midsized firms coming through. So that's where we're seeing more of that deal flow.\n\nJust as a reminder, for the large clients that we have been able to win through competitive displacement, that includes Merrill, Royal Bank of Canada, Raymond James and Bank of Montreal. And with this newest one, which actually for us is the one the longest or rather the highest total contract value, it was a displacement of a long-time incumbent. And so we look forward to building that relationship with them for the long term since our contract with them is actually longer than average, over 5 years.\n\nAnd so as wealth clients, now the mid-tier client -- wealth clients are now coming on board and wanting to modernize their platform because their clients are demanding more sophisticated and digital technologies, and they don't have the platform to be able to scale. And that's where they're turning to us.\n\nTotal cost of ownership is really quite key. And so the discussions that we're having include everything from -- and this is back to your question, whether or not they want to get the data from APIs, for example, which does require more development costs. They need people to put that in, versus, say, one of the products we're seeing a lot of demand for us, which are widgets, which are easier to put in and therefore quicker.\n\nSo those are some of the dynamics we're seeing. That's where we're expanding beyond the wealth platform only and going into data and then also into the CRM side, which is allowing our wealth clients to focus on their top line and giving their advisers the tools to be able to drive top line growth.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Russell Quelch from Redburn Atlantic.\n\nRussell Quelch\n\nSo you had good user count growth and a slowdown in the client growth, and I think that's because of those 2 large deals you called out. So I'm interested in, is this a purposeful tilt in the sales strategy towards targeting larger enterprise deals? And therefore, should we expect ASP growth to be maybe more lumpy, more volatile on a quarterly basis going forward as a result of that approach?\n\nAnd I also wondered, can you be a bit more specific around what you've assumed to be the size of the impact from Credit Suisse in your ASP this year? And if that's all going to come in the second quarter, please?\n\nFrederick Philip Snow\n\nYes, I'm not sure we'll be able to speak to the exact size of that. But yes, I think the opportunity for us to do much larger deals is increasing. And what is really encouraging, Russell, is across wealth, which we just saw a big win in, we had a very nice win on the institutional buy side this quarter in trading. And the revenue for that doesn't really materialize until those trading systems get implemented. So that can take a while.\n\nWe had a fantastic large win in Q4 on the managed services side for performance. And then in banking, we've had some significant wins where we've completely displaced a competitor because of deep sector. So I'm beginning to see, in my conversations with the C-suite of our bigger clients, a real appetite to engage more with FactSet. So yes, I hope stuff's lumpy, particularly on the upside, right?\n\nAnd when you get those 8-figure contracts or those 7-figure contracts, it can sway things. I think one of the beauties about FactSet's business model is our consistency, though. And I think as markets return to more normalcy, we'll still get a lot of singles, doubles and triples, which will I think continue to hopefully smooth things out. But yes, we're always hunting for those big deals, and the possibility of us getting those now is much larger just based on the product suite and our open strategy.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Jeffrey Silber from BMO Capital Markets.\n\nJeffrey Marc Silber\n\nI wanted to go back to AI. You had mentioned that your focus is more on the client side, and I believe you launched FactSet Mercury. Can we have a little bit more color on that and maybe what your plans are going forward?\n\nKristina W. Karnovsky\n\nSure. Jeffrey, this is Kristy. Yes, we're very excited about FactSet Mercury. But maybe it will be helpful if I talk a little bit about the whole AI Blueprint and just highlight the areas in there where I think FactSet is really differentiated in our approach to responsibly leveraging AI to deliver value to our clients.\n\nSo the first pillar of the blueprint is all about what we call mile-wide discoverability. And FactSet Mercury, which we talked about in the press release, it's our conversational AI interface. And it's designed to unlock discoverability of all of the content and functionality that FactSet has to offer for our users. And it's really going to become the mainstay of the FactSet user experience of the future, which is going to be a lot more personalized and insight-driven.\n\nAnd I think what's really interesting with Mercury, it's really our approach to providing auditability back to the reports and documents in context. That's going to be a real time saver for users because it's going to enable them to act quickly on that information that they're getting back and then move on with a high level of confidence to the next steps that they're taking.\n\nSo really, throughout the whole development process leading up to the beta release, we conducted extensive user research. And through this, we really validated how important it is to deliver that auditability of the data back to our users. And we've already gotten great feedback on this and how we're approaching that in the client meetings that we've had. As well as the other features that it offers like suggested prompts and next steps to guide users to insights that they might not have even realized were available.\n\nThe second pillar of the AI Blueprint is what we call mile-deep workflow automation. So our strategy is really way beyond building an answer bot and kind of stopping there. So we're going user-by-user type, workflow by workflow to leverage gen AI and help streamline the workflows of each of our different client types that we know really well from over 40 years of supporting them.\n\nSo you would have read in the release that the first release of FactSet Mercury is geared for junior bankers, but it will expand from there. But so for now, for junior bankers, in addition to being able to answer any questions that they have about companies, it can take a lot of steps out of the banker pitchbook-building workflow process.\n\nSo one great example of that is just by enabling them to simply ask for any chart in natural language and then have it delivered to them as a custom formatted FactSet Active Graph, which is then forever refreshable inside their pitch decks. So they don't need to search through a gallery. They don't have to adjust any setting. It's just super easy for them.\n\nAnd then the last pillar of our strategy is what we call mile-high innovation acceleration. We're very excited about what gen AI unlocks in our own product development process, and our teams are busy here building some really amazing solutions. But it's also, I think, important for everybody to remember that we're developing those things in ways that can be leveraged as building blocks by our clients in their own products.\n\nAnd I think our open, flexible approach to this is very differentiated and unique. And we've already begun to commercialize our data solutions in that way. And I think there will be more demand for these building blocks as clients make more progress with executing on their own AI road maps.\n\nSo those are the 3 pillars. And yes, we're very excited about FactSet Mercury launching into our FactSet Explorer's beta program last week.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Owen Lau from Oppenheimer.\n\nOwen Lau\n\nSo just a follow-up on the previous question about AI for client side. I know it's still early, but could you please talk about the demand and timing of monetizing Mercury or other AI products? How does it help the contract negotiations so far? And how much have you baked into your ASV growth guidance in 2024?\n\nKristina W. Karnovsky\n\nI can talk -- this is Kristy. Thank you for the question. I can talk a little bit about the approach we think we're going to take here. What I was talking about with mile-wide discoverability with FactSet Mercury, we see that really as a natural evolution of the FactSet user experience. And so some level of conversational experience would be included with our different workstation packages. And I know that this is going to help users unlock more value and improve their efficiency.\n\nFor what we call the mile-deep workflow automation in our AI Blueprint, things like pitchbook building and automation with gen AI for investment banking or portfolio performance commentary for the buy side and other mile-deep workflows, we are currently working on the best commercial models for this. We're going to be able to significantly streamline these workflows and drive a measurable level of efficiency for our clients. So there's definitely going to be value there for them.\n\nAnd I think we're going to be able to share more color in future quarters as we make more progress and we get a little bit further along in the FactSet Explorer beta program. Yes, so hopefully, that gives a little bit more color.\n\nHelen L. Shan\n\nAnd Kristy, I'll add a little bit to what you just said to answer the second part of your question, Owen, which is monetization is one that everyone is trying to determine. I think that you'll see -- or we'll see rather, the benefits certainly come through from increased retention. And in fact, it's allowing us to have some very interesting conversations with new clients. So we're going to see how those come through, but it is not baked specifically into certainly the guidance for this year.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Ashish Sabadra from RBC Capital Markets.\n\nAshish Sabadra\n\nJust a question on the 6-, 7-figure deals which are in the pipeline. Are the closing of those contingent on opening up of the client budgets? And also on the last call, there was a reference around potentially client budgets opening up for calendar year '24. And I was wondering, based on your -- obviously, you had a lot of conversation on macro, but just based on the client conversation, what are the expectations for client budgets for next year? Any color on that front?\n\nHelen L. Shan\n\nThanks for that question. Yes, you're right. We -- as Linda had talked about, we thought a bit of the recovery would improve more quickly into the second half of the year. It's probably a little bit later. And so what we're hearing right now and clients are sort of finishing up their budgeting process, that most budgets are probably more flat. And what -- but they're still being asked to do a lot more with what they have.\n\nAnd as I mentioned before, their ability to scale is still something that's top of mind. So to your point around the 6- to 7-figure deals, yes, certainly, some of that will depend on budgets improving. As mentioned, some of the benefit we have in our open platform is you can do things in pieces. So you don't have to commit to the whole redo of a platform, for example. But certainly, as more dollars are being allocated to technology and gen AI, we feel we're pretty well positioned to take advantage of that.\n\nOperator\n\n(Operator Instructions) Our next question comes from the line of Surinder Thind from Jefferies LLC.\n\nSurinder Singh Thind\n\nLinda, just a big picture question here. I guess if I'm interpreting your prepared comments correctly, it seems like you're attributing some of the change in your outlook to kind of the market recovery taking maybe a bit longer than that -- than what you guys had anticipated back in September. But I guess given how much sentiment has improved since that time, or at least in the last 45 days, like can you help me understand why this is the case? Like could you not argue that, from where we stand today, the outlook from a client perspective should be more positive now than when you initially gave guidance?\n\nLike -- it seems like there's a bit of a disconnect, and I'm not sure if there's some near-term dynamics here. Because I know October was obviously very negative from a sentiment perspective and then we had a complete reversal. So I'm just not sure if we're seeing the reversal yet and people are still kind of focused on the October -- the sentiment at that point in time. It just seems like there's a bit of a disconnect here.\n\nLinda S. Huber\n\nYes. It's a perfectly fair question and one that I sort of wrestled with as we were getting ready for this call. So we originally gave guidance on September 21. You will recall that then, we had the very tragic events of October 7, which made the macro situation even more difficult. So we gave guidance before that piece happened. And sentiment, frankly, got worse. We're coming to the calendar year-end for a lot of our clients, budgets got thinner, they tightened their belts yet again.\n\nAnd then last Wednesday, we got what I think everybody considers to be a bit of a surprise from Chairman Powell. I like this expression of he shot the bears. The market has turned dramatically and hard. Is it ahead of itself? It could be.\n\nBut what I said before is really very important. The hiring in -- for some of our clients is a lagging indicator. So we have to work through that, clear that, take the impact of what's going on with the Credit Suisse situation in our second quarter in a conservative way and then get back on track, which we are looking to do.\n\nAnd I think, yes, the unusual combination of our fiscal year-end. And when some pretty big news events have happened, have caused what you might consider to be a bit of a disconnect, but I hope that the explanation has helped you.\n\nSo we're quite optimistic, and I'm going to turn it over to Phil to sort of bring us in for a landing here. But we very much appreciate your point of view and your question and your notes on timing. Probably pretty appropriate, but we are excited about what's coming next. And maybe Phil can comment on that.\n\nFrederick Philip Snow\n\nYes. Thanks, Linda. So yes, I mean, the sales cycles for our clients do take some time, particularly for our enterprise solutions. So I really hope sentiment has turned, and like we spoke about on this call, that it's just a question of timing.\n\nSo to summarize, we're very excited, obviously, about artificial intelligence. We have a lot of FactSetters out in the market working with our clients. And nothing beats sort of showing the product to the client and getting that wow back from them. So we're all really behind this. We've made a lot of progress in the last year, and I feel like we're really in good shape versus the competition based on what I'm seeing.\n\nWe did take the guidance down just because the turn is taking a bit longer than we thought, which we just spoke to. Second quarter will be a little slower than planned, just to summarize. So we may be taking a bit of a conservative view there. And we did mention the -- in particular, the Credit Suisse acquisition by UBS, which was well known.\n\nAnd then just to summarize, I'm going to give a bit of a plug for FactSet Focus. So we're having our flagship user event in Miami this April and the beginning of May. It's the first time we've done this in a number of years.\n\nWe're bringing together top thought leaders, industry experts and key decision-makers from both the finance and tech sectors. We're really going to be focused very heavily on artificial intelligence and really demonstrating what we've done there. And hopefully, that will be really engaging for anyone that attends.\n\nSo that's it. We'll see you all next quarter. Operator, that ends today's call.\n\nOperator\n\nThank you. This concludes today's conference call. Thank you for participating. You may now disconnect.",

        "body": "(NewsUSA) - When it comes to generative artificial intelligence (GenAI), the United States government needs to adjust its mission and tradecraft to advance American interests, according to experts at the Special Competitive Studies Project (SCSP), a bipartisan nonprofit organization.\n\nDespite its current position as a global leader GenAI, the issue facing the United States is how to shape GenAI's global use and function so that it reinforces these interests, according to a new report from SCSP.\n\nThe authors outline recommendations for a new model of statecraft and the creation of global institutions to chart a way for GenAI to be used for good, and to put guardrails in place to protect against negative consequences.\n\nSCSP advises the U.S. government to bring together different departments, authorities, talents, and tools, and to establish domestic regulatory policies that also reflect a global context, to work alongside like-minded allies, but not to disadvantage the U.S. private sector in global competition.\n\nPlatforms Statecraft. A platform approach to foreign policy and GenAI should include an updated mission with competition around technology platforms, as well as joint efforts across government agencies, modernization, and sub-national diplomacy to ensure that U.S. policy is tied into domestic innovation at the state and local levels.\n\nNew Tools. The adoption of GenAI tools by the Department of State will change the way workforces do their jobs, but these high-tech tools do not replace decision-making by policy experts; instead, GenAI tools provide additional, and potentially novel, recommendations and solutions based on an amount of information that no one human can process as quickly as a machine. Agency-wide programs to leverage GenAI could include a centralized GenAI infrastructure, a tailored GenAI system to handle sensitive information, and training policy makers to understand how GI works and where human oversight is needed.\n\nGlobal Frameworks. To manage GenAI as a geopolitical and transnational issue, SCSP recommends creating a leaders-level forum to bring together key nations and address the highest-level risks that GenAI may pose; a leaders-level agenda item on GenAI in bilateral dialogues between the U.S. and the People's Republic of Chine to help manage strategic stability risks; and a working-level forum for like-minded national to explore positive use cases around GenAI and mitigate against practical challenges.\n\nFor more information, visit scsp.ai.",

        "title": "Lawyers Covered - December 2023",
        "body": "What could be more festive than our December edition of Lawyers Covered - so here it is, a gift from the Lawyers Liability and Regulatory Group at RPC, to all of you, our lovely readers! If you have any feedback or ideas for topics that you would like us to cover in the newsletter or in our seminars, please let us know. Happy holidays!\n\nAll I want for Christmas is... compulsory mediation?\n\nEver since the Court of Appeal's 2004 comment that \"to oblige truly unwilling parties to refer their disputes to mediation would be to impose an unacceptable obstruction on their right of access to the court\" (Halsey v Milton Keynes General NHS Trust), a dispute has been simmering over whether compulsory ADR breaches a party's Article 6 rights. The Court of Appeal in the recent case of Churchill v Merthyr Tydfil [2023] EWCA Civ 1416 concluded that it was lawful for the Court to order the parties to engage in ADR, provided it does not interfere with the claimant's access to a judicial determination.\n\nThe case was widely expected to lay down principles governing the Court's powers to order parties to engage in ADR and to overrule Halsey; however, the Court of Appeal declined to lay down any definitive guidelines for use of the Court's power to order parties to engage in ADR and concluded that the principle from Halsey was not binding, paving the way for judges to order ADR in other cases. We anticipate that Churchill will make it easier to obtain a stay for ADR and may lead to an increase in Court-ordered ADR. Even if it does, it remains to be seen how effective ADR will be if the Court has to order it.\n\nLast Christmas, I gave you my Part 36 offer\n\nWe are all well versed in the benefits of a well placed Part 36 offer in the course of litigation or detailed assessment, but how does Part 36 apply to Solicitors Act assessments? Costs Judge Leonard has the answer. He recently held in Zuhri v Vardags Ltd [2023] EWHC 3050 (SCCO) that the automatic consequences prescribed by Part 36 have no place in a solicitor/client costs assessment under s70 Solicitors Act 1974.\n\nCosts Judge Leonard found that \"s70 of the Solicitors Act 1974 provides its own checks and balances, and is, in many ways, its own self-contained code\". CPR Part 36 is not capable of displacing this primary statutory provision in its current form. However, s70 of the Solicitors Act 1974 also contains discretion available to the court in 'special circumstances'. A Part 36 offer may well therefore be sufficient to persuade the court of a special circumstance and therefore attract adverse costs orders against those who fail to beat a Part 36 offer. A Part 36 Offer is therefore more likely to be considered as an admissible offer under the court's general discretion.\n\nInterestingly Costs Judge Leonard provided additional food for thought in his parting comment. In circumstances whereby the Solicitors Act Assessment had arisen during the course of Part 7 proceedings for recovery of outstanding fees, Part 36 may well apply to those proceedings. As such, a party could, theoretically, revive the Part 7 proceedings to reap the benefits of a well-placed Part 36 offer.\n\nHopefully, this state of affairs will not persist for too long as the Government is expected to review the outdated and problematic Solicitors Act 1974 in 2024.\n\n\"AI\", the Herald angels sing: SRA report on AI in the legal sector\n\nOne of the key themes of discussion of 2023 has been the increasing sophistication of artificial intelligence (AI), and the advantages and dangers this spells for society as a whole. Indeed, the Collins Dictionary word of the year for 2023 is AI, and the increasing popularity of ChatGPT has led to both celebration and concern in numerous industries. The legal sector is thought to be one of the areas which could be most impacted by technological developments in AI.\n\nLast month, the SRA published a new report on the pros and cons of the use of AI in the legal services sector. The report outlines current and potential future developments, and what law firms need to do in each area to consider how they may be affected.\n\nOf course, AI can make (and in some areas has already made) administrative tasks more efficient for lawyers, leading to speed and costs savings. However, the SRA also notes that it can lead to risks, including accuracy and bias problems, the maintenance of client confidentiality and data security, as well as accountability.\n\nThe report also addresses potential barriers for firms in adopting AI in a useful manner, including issues of cost as well as insurance: it notes that the insurance market's approach to covering the use of legal AI is still emerging, and firms will need to engage closely with insurers to make sure misunderstandings do not cause unnecessary costs.\n\nDing Dong Merrily on High: Increase in guideline hourly rates from 1 January 2024\n\nThe Master of the Rolls, Sir Geoffrey Vos, has endorsed the Civil Justice Council's review on costs. The 2021 Guideline Hourly Rates (GHR) will increase from 1 January 2024 by about 6.5% to reflect inflation and will then be increased annually in line with the Services Producer Price Inflation (SPPI) index. The MR also confirmed that a small working group will be established to examine the methodology underlying the GHRs.\n\nPrior to the 2021 reforms to the GHR, the rates were often approached tentatively by costs judges as the profession accepted that they were out-of-date; however, with updated rates being increased annually, we can expect to see costs judges applying the GHRs more confidently with less scope for dispute. However, increasing the GHRs will not avert all disputes as the GHRs are \"broad approximations only\" (according to the 2021 Guide to the Summary Assessment of Costs). Whether, and when, to depart from the GHRs remains a contentious issue. The 2021 Guide states that \"a significantly higher\" hourly rate may be justified in \"substantial and complex litigation\" where factors such as the value, complexity, urgency or importance of the litigation are in play. Case law on this point continues to develop, with the Court of Appeal in Samsung Electronics Co Ltd v LG Display Co Ltd in 2022 commenting that where rates in excess of the GHRs are being sought, a \"clear and compelling justification\" must be provided. In 2023, the Court of Appeal in Various Claimants v News Group Newspapers Limited confirmed that the Court would have regard to the \"seven pillars of wisdom\" in CPR 44.4 when deciding what hourly rates are appropriate.\n\nThe new rates are as follows, with the current (or soon to be former) rates in brackets.\n\nO Come [to jail] All Ye Faithful: solicitor who tipped off client over SFO investigation gets suspended prison sentence\n\nOn 30 November 2023 the SFO prosecuted a solicitor for \"tipping off\" his client about a money laundering probe.\n\nFollowing a five-day trial at the Old Bailey, a solicitor, William Osmond, director and money laundering reporting officer for his law firm Osmond & Osmond Solicitors Ltd, was convicted for tipping off under the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002. The judge found that he had tipped off his client James Redding Ramsay about an SFO investigation into Ramsay's loan of £4 million towards the purchase of a house in Mayfair. The judge also found that Osmond had forged a retainer letter that set out his role as solicitor for a British Virgin Islands company which was purchased by Ramsay. Despite having been warned three times by the SFO investigator not to tell his client about the investigation, Osmond met Ramsey multiple times over five months to discuss the matter. He flew to Ramsay's home in Malta and met him at a private dining club in west London.\n\nOsmond's actions were discovered after SFO investigators searched his office in April 2019 and found handwritten notes about his discussions with Ramsay and computer files that showed his forgery of the legal letter.\n\nHe was sentenced to nine months in prison, suspended for 18 months and must comply with a community order of 100 hours of unpaid work. He must also pay a contribution of £5,000 towards the SFO's costs.\n\nThe SRA has confirmed that it had been awaiting the outcome of the SFO's prosecution and will now \"collect all relevant information before deciding on next steps\". This coincides with the new Economic Crime and Corporate Transparency Act 2023 becoming law on 26 October 2023 permitting the SRA to impose unlimited fines on law firms, solicitors and employees in cases related to economic crime.\n\nThis is the first ever time the SFO has prosecuted a solicitor for tipping off a client. A stark reminder that solicitors can not only be struck off and fined but also imprisoned if they do not abide by legislation.\n\nAway in a Manger: Updates from Hong Kong\n\n\"Greater Bay Area\" Legal Professional Exam - In our May 2022 update we reported on the pilot scheme for the Guangdong-Hong Kong-Macao Greater Bay Area legal professional exam for Hong Kong lawyers who are at least five years qualified, permanent residents of Hong Kong and Chinese citizens. In September 2023, the State Council of the People's Republic of China announced that the pilot scheme had been extended for a further three years and that the admission criteria had been reduced to a minimum of three years post-qualification experience. On passing the examination and being registered in the GBA, a Hong Kong lawyer can advise on certain civil and commercial legal matters in the nine Mainland cities of the GBA. Given the increased economic activity between the GBA and Hong Kong, the pilot scheme is becoming more important to locally qualified lawyers in Hong Kong. From a profession of approximately 13,000 Hong Kong practising lawyers, approximately 375 have successfully obtained a licence to practice as a \"GBA Lawyer\".\n\n\"Cross-Boundary\" enforcement of Judgments between Mainland China and Hong Kong - In our March 2023 update we reported on the enactment of the Mainland Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters (Reciprocal Enforcement) Ordinance. The Ordinance implements the \"Arrangement on Reciprocal Recognition and Enforcement of Judgments in Civil and Commercial Matters by the Courts of the Mainland and of the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region\", signed between Mainland China and Hong Kong authorities in January 2019. On 10 November 2023, the Hong Kong government announced that the Ordinance will come into effect on 29 January 2024. In preparation, the Chief Judge of the High Court has approved the relevant rules, which provide for: (i) applications to register and enforce a relevant Mainland judgment in Hong Kong; and (ii) applications to obtain a certified copy of a Hong Kong judgment to facilitate recognition and enforcement in Mainland China. The Arrangement in Mainland China will be implemented pursuant to a judicial interpretation of the Supreme People's Court.",

        "title": "Billionaire Paytm CEO Bets on Young Wealth to Hit Profit Sooner",
        "body": "(Bloomberg) -- Sign up for the India Edition newsletter by Menaka Doshi - an insider's guide to the emerging economic powerhouse, and the billionaires and businesses behind its rise, delivered weekly.\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg\n\nPaytm plans to revamp its online wealth management services and hire more than 50,000 salespeople to get more merchants on its network, aiming to hit profitability sooner than targeted.\n\nBillionaire founder-CEO Vijay Shekhar Sharma is overhauling its suite of money management products to better tap growing wealth among younger users, who're warmer to the idea of investing online. At the same time, it's orchestrating a campaign to boost its salesforce more than 60% to try and sign up more merchants across smaller Indian cities and towns.\n\nThe twin initiatives mark an ambitious effort to turn around Paytm, officially called One 97 Communications Ltd., once hailed as a new-economy symbol of India's startup scene. The company has fallen roughly 70% since a $2.5 billion 2021 IPO as investors fret about persistent losses, while rivals such as Walmart Inc.'s PhonePE and regulatory curbs threaten to sap growth.\n\nNow, Sharma says the wealth and merchants push, coupled with cost savings from AI automation, could help Paytm generate an operating profit in under a year. That would be faster than previous internal projections or analysts' estimates, the CEO said without elaborating.\n\n\"We have learned and we will amplify our ability to serve India, its small merchants and businesses,\" he told Bloomberg News in his company's chrome-and-glass headquarters on the outskirts of New Delhi. \"We should be crossing about 50 million merchant-base signed up on the Paytm platform in the year,\" he said from offices overlooking condominiums on one side and a large construction site on the other.\n\nThe Noida-based company had about 38 million merchants as of September, nearly 10 million of whom were paying for offerings such as QR codes, Soundboxes or audio payments confirmation machines and card machines.\n\nSharma, 45, the son of teacher from a small town in India's most populous state of Uttar Pradesh, founded One 97 in 2010. The company began by offering services such as recharges for pre-paid mobile services, but a federal withdrawal of high-value currency notes in 2016 gave its business a fillip. It grew rapidly into India's most ubiquitous payments brand, and counted Jack Ma's Ant Group Co. and Masayoshi Son's SoftBank Group Corp. among its backers.\n\nThe company launched its digital wealth management product, Paytm Money, around 2018. Its mutual fund business has done moderately well since, but the firm wants to double down on the business, layering it with artificial intelligence, as India's middle class increasingly go online to invest in capital markets. Insurance is another fertile field given a lower penetration in India, Sharma said. The total addressable market for financial services could cover 250 million of India's 1.4 billion people in the near term, he added.\n\n\"Young customers are headed towards this. So we are saying, okay, let's just build our trading platform with investor protection and with recommendations, the power of AI and a high transaction success rate,\" Sharma said in a Tuesday interview.\n\nSharma is pushing his 10,000-strong technology, product and engineering teams to use Microsoft Corp. and Google AI tools. That has helped Paytm narrow product development to just days from weeks. Sharma, like other companies using automation, expects he may need fewer staff.\n\n\"We will be able to save the targeted 10% to 15% that we had planned in employee costs, all because AI has actually delivered more than what we expected it to,\" he said.\n\nPaytm said in February it had achieved operating profitability before factoring in the cost of employee stock ownership plans. It now wants to be in the black on a full operating basis, which Sharma foresees happening sooner than the company anticipated.\n\nIt has generated free cash for the past two quarters and Sharma expects that trajectory to continue. Paytm has trimmed quarterly losses and quickened lending despite rising competition from PhonePe and Alphabet Inc.'s GPay.\n\n\"This year was the year where we could tell the world that there is a viable commercial model of Paytm,\" said Sharma. \"And in the year onwards, we will mature to another stage, which is called shareholder returns.\"\n\nMost Read from Bloomberg Businessweek",

        "title": "SIGGRAPH Asia 2023 Sets New Heights for Innovation in Sydney:  Gears Up for Next Edition in Tokyo",
        "body": "SYDNEY, AU, Dec 20, 2023 - (ACN Newswire) - - SIGGRAPH Asia 2023 concluded on December 15th at the iconic International Convention Centre Sydney (ICC Sydney). The event, organized by Koelnmesse Pte Ltd and ACM SIGGRAPH, a renowned special interest group within the Association for Computing Machinery (ACM), marked a tremendous success in shaping the future of animation, virtual reality, artificial intelligence, and related Computer Graphics and Interactive Techniques technologies. With 5,690 attendees hailing from more than 40 countries and featuring 30 exhibiting brands, the conference and exhibition exemplified the industry's vibrant dynamism and rapid growth.\n\nSIGGRAPH Asia 2023 Conference Chair June Kim said, \"As the curtain falls on SIGGRAPH Asia 2023 in Sydney, it stands out as a brilliant success. Thousands of visitors from over 40 countries experienced innovation at its peak, with over 30 leading brands and impactful presentations setting new standards in computer graphics and interactive techniques. From keynotes by luminaries to groundbreaking showcases and awards, we're grateful for the support of computer, animation, and tech visionaries. Special thanks to our partners in Sydney for being tremendous hosts.\"\n\nKey Highlights and Achievements\n\nThe SIGGRAPH Asia 2023 Conference and Exhibition represented a vibrant showcase of the latest developments in the Computer Graphics (CG) arena. Luminaries Jun Murai of Keio University and Joe Letteri from Weta FX, shared invaluable insights with their keynote presentations on \"Internet Civilization: A New Frontier for Humankind\" and \"Innovation & Avatar: The Way of Water\" respectively.\n\nThe event buzzed with intellectual stimulation. Featured sessions included speakers like Rob Bredow of Industrial Light & Magic, and Paul Debevec of Netflix, who offered unique perspectives, touching on themes ranging from the synergy of art and technology to the frontiers of virtual production. Forward-thinking panels delved into the latest trends in Character Animation, VFX, Digital Humans, and the future of computer animation tools.\n\nThe Conference also took a compelling look into how a hybrid society is emerging via extended reality by exploring how with Digital Twin, artifacts, space, and humans can be replicated in a digital form. One of the highlights was a real-time demonstration that demonstrated how digital twin, big data visualization, and extended reality can connect from Sydney to other cities via Super Speed Connectivity.\n\nMuch conversation at SIGGRAPH Asia 2023 revolved around Generative AI, a topic that was brought up at numerous sessions. These sessions delved into the intricacies and applications of Generative AI, providing valuable insights, and expanding the overall understanding of this cutting-edge technology.\n\nFostering Future Talent and Education\n\nThe theme \"Connecting Stories\" rang true among participants, who described how important it was to convey how their technology was being applied in an everyday sense - whether it be to help blind people navigate, or an apparatus that uses sign language. Students, Researchers, and Academics mingled with those from industry, sharing their ideas and work in progress.\n\nAttracting newcomers to the industry is important, and so SIGGRAPH Asia sought ways to proactively interest the young. Another notable highlight of the conference was the Computer Animation Festival, which featured an eclectic mix of 38 films, ranging from narrative shorts to scientific visualizations. It included works from the inaugural Junior Computer Animation Festival, which brought to life the event's commitment to fostering new talent.\n\nTechnological Showcases and Inclusivity\n\nSIGGRAPH Asia 2023 was a technological extravaganza. Emerging technologies were showcased that are set to redefine the industry. Over 900 Technical Papers were submitted to SIGGRAPH Asia 2023 and juried by more than 180 experts and over 3,000 anonymous peer reviewers.\n\nCourses and Talks sessions, particularly those focusing on the transformative potential of artificial intelligence on the tools the industry uses, were a window into the future of the industry. New tools offer potential in lowering the barriers to entry for more artists and designers to join the computer graphics and interactive techniques sectors.\n\nInspiring panel discussions underscored how SIGGRAPH Asia places emphasis on creating a neuro-diverse and inclusive community, providing a nurturing environment for discussions and learning as to Diversity, Equity and Inclusion (DEI).\n\nRecognizing Excellence\n\nOutstanding individuals and teams were celebrated through multiple esteemed awards programs (refer to this link). Among the notable honorees, Australian artist Paul Brown received the prestigious Distinguished Artist Award for Lifetime Achievement in Digital Art from SIGGRAPH ACM and Singaporean Associate Professor Yong Tsui (YT) Lee was honored with the SIGGRAPH ACM Outstanding Service Award in recognition of his nurturing and fostering of the SIGGRAPH Asia community and Conference.\n\nAn intriguing Exhibition\n\nVisitors to the SIGGRAPH Asia 2023 Exhibition left with their imaginations ignited by the boundless potential of technology. From healthcare and transportation to the vast realms of space and entertainment, technology was showcased as a powerful force bringing visualization and interactive tools into our everyday lives. Prominent industry leaders, including FORUM8, Adobe, NVIDIA, Industrial Light and Magic, MSI, Vicon, and Weta FX exhibited, offering glimpses into the future of Animation & Visual Effects, Augmented Reality, Cloud-based Systems, Computer Graphics, Interactive & Innovative Technologies, Gaming Technologies, Imaging, Virtual Reality & Simulation, Visualization, and much more.\n\nPeople attended Demoscene to see the very cutting-edge of computer demonstrations, and the Experience Hall to participate in an immersive Art Gallery, an Extended Reality (XR) program, and witness the emergence of the very latest Emerging Technologies for CGI, special effects (FX) and animation.\n\nAdding to the allure of the event were the exhilarating Exhibitor Talks, featuring influential speakers from Adobe, Canva, DNEG, Foundry, Gigabyte, NVIDIA, and Pixar Animation Studios, who enthralled and inspired audiences with the latest advancements in technology and the innovative techniques that are shaping the future.\n\nTo Tokyo and Beyond\n\nAs SIGGRAPH Asia 2023 drew to a close, it left an indelible mark on Sydney participants, many of whom had never attended a SIGGRAPH event prior. Hosting the event in Sydney is a reflection of the nation's growing importance in the global computer graphics industry. The local surge in activities in both 2D and 3D animation work is evident in the increasing demand for artists and expansion of local production companies in these fields, and insofar as local companies are expanding their capabilities and adopting new technologies for series work.\n\nConference Chair June Kim encapsulated the spirit of the event, expressing gratitude to the supporters and looking forward to the next edition in Tokyo: \"I am deeply grateful to all the local and international supporters for making this edition in Sydney exceptionally memorable and successful. We eagerly anticipate the next gathering in Tokyo in early December 2024!\"\n\nRob Coleman, Computer Animation Festival Co-Chair\n\nCommenting on the importance of SIGGRAPH Asia, Rob Coleman said, \"It has truly been an honour to co-chair the Computer Animation Festival at SIGGRAPH Asia 2023.\" He added, \"My SIGGRAPH journey began in 1992 in Chicago; the Electronic Theater at that event left an indelible impression on me. Back then, the internet didn't exist, which meant that SIGGRAPH was the hub for seeing the latest in computer graphics. At that time, I had a limited view of the field; however, attending SIGGRAPH introduced me to a world of diverse content... Witnessing the exceptional global talent showcased this year is incredibly rewarding.\"\n\nAttendee, Philippe Huibonhoa, 24, University of Technology Sydney\n\nPhilippe Huibonhoa delighted in the fact that he could participate in most aspects of the conference. He observed that, \"We, through the innovation and technology, like we as humankind, are getting closer, especially with the advances in AI. We're finding ways to connect in ways that we couldn't, couldn't never have dreamed of, [which he saw] especially in the Art Gallery.\"\n\nMaria Zelenskaya, Griffith University\n\nFrom the many papers submitted, and from those chosen to exhibit, there were multiple groundbreaking technology advancements that were acclaimed at SIGGRAPH Asia 2023.

Your use of this website signifies your acceptance of our terms and conditions as well as our privacy policy.\n\nIn a significant move, OpenAI has introduced its Preparedness Team as part of a comprehensive strategy to bolster the safety measures surrounding artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe company, renowned for its AI tools, like ChatGPT, aims to address potential risks and ensure responsible AI deployment.\n\nThis move follows the growing concerns regarding the safe use of AI technology and its impacts on the end users. It reflects OpenAI's dedication to ethical and responsible AI practices.\n\nOne of the vital areas of focus of OpenAI's team is maintaining the company's safety and how it controls its policy divisions. This is pivotal for addressing the increasing risks found in powerful AI models by predicting and examining them respectively.\n\nThrough this process, the tech team can easily establish a strong system that will prevent such incidents from continuing in artificial intelligence applications. Information from a blog post released on December 18 reveals the OpenAI's instructions to the team regarding report reviews.\n\nAfter the successful examination of the reports, the team will send the results to the firm's officials and board to establish effective decisions.\n\nMeanwhile, the creation of the Preparedness Team aligns with the industry's step to control the risk with artificial intelligence. This is reflected in a significant partnership between known tech companies like Microsoft, Google, Anthropic, etc.\n\nThe idea was to form a collective initiative termed Frontier Model Forum, allowing self-regulation in using artificial intelligence. Importantly, OpenAI emphasizes its commitment to more accountability and transparency in AI development.\n\nAside from OpenAI, a few other popular tech companies have been committing to the safety of implementing artificial intelligence in their businesses. Among the companies involved are Google DeepMind, IBM, Salesforce, Adobe, Amazon, Meta, and Microsoft.\n\nThis commitment was seen in September 2023 when these companies, including five extra firms, clarified their willingness to address the safety of artificial intelligence. But while safety remains a keyword aspect of their pledge, they also mentioned transparency and security as additional areas of focus.\n\nAs the risks with artificial intelligence technology raise concerns, these firms continue to implement various strategies to curb the situation. Some of the notable steps involved are substantial investments in cybersecurity measures. Tech firms are not only focusing on their internal security.\n\nThey are also encouraging third parties to uncover potential security vulnerabilities actively. Moreover, the commitment extends to the reporting of societal risks linked to artificial intelligence. These include inappropriate uses and biases that may emerge during the development and deployment of AI technologies.\n\nMeanwhile, specialized attention to AI safety is needed, and the UK and US have recognized this and have set up new institutes to address it. The UK institute stands as a global hub for AI safety and reflects the ongoing efforts to address potential AI risks on an international scale.",

        "title": "Bolstering the Semiconductors CHIPS Act With Foreign STEM Workers",
        "body": "The nation's semiconductor chip shortage has far-reaching implications for industries ranging from consumer electronics to national security. The Creating Helpful Incentives to Produce Semiconductors for America Act (CHIPS Act) aims to address this shortfall. It provides substantial investments in semiconductor research, development, and manufacturing capabilities within the United States, fostering innovation and job creation.\n\nThe CHIPS Act's increased production will bring employment concerns related to staffing, immigration, and diversity, among others. In the highly competitive and rapidly evolving technology industry, attracting and retaining top talent with expertise in STEM (science, technology, engineering, and mathematics) fields is essential. Foreign national talent, combined with the availability of various U.S. visas, will play a crucial role in supporting the goals of the CHIPS Act.\n\nRobust Hiring Initiatives\n\nA Semiconductor Industry Association indicated that the industry must fill 115,000 jobs by 2030 to meet the goals outlined in the CHIPS Act. Meeting these ambitious numbers will require companies to ramp up hiring significantly in the sector. Many of these roles will require a two- or four-year degree in engineering or computer science. Early research has indicated there are simply not enough U.S. students in the pipeline. Therefore, many companies likely will need to turn to foreign nationals and recruit and retain international students to bridge the hiring gap.\n\nForeign Talent in Technology Industry\n\nInnovation knows no borders, and the technology industry is inherently global. To maintain leadership in semiconductor technology and related fields, U.S. employers will seek to leverage the global talent pool. Foreign nationals (including scientists, engineers, and researchers) have long contributed significantly to the technological advancement of the United States, and tomorrow will be no different.\n\nExpertise and Innovation: Foreign national workers bring diverse perspectives, experiences, and expertise to the technology sector. They often possess specialized skills and knowledge crucial to the development and production of cutting-edge semiconductor technology. A 2021 report conducted by the American Immigration Council showed that more than one out of every five (22.7 percent) STEM workers in the United States was born in another country.\n\nBridging Skill Gaps: The semiconductor industry is highly specialized, requiring a workforce with a deep understanding of materials science, electrical engineering, and computer science. Utilizing the pool of highly skilled foreign national workers in the United States enables companies to fill critical skill gaps and contribute to the development of next-generation technologies.\n\nU.S. Visas and CHIPS Act\n\nTo attract and retain foreign national talent in the technology industry, various U.S. visa programs are available, among other options, including the following:\n\nThese visa programs not only facilitate the entry of skilled professionals, but also align with the goals of the CHIPS Act. However, they are limited in their reach due to statutory eligibility requirements and numerical limits. Accordingly, immigration reform to expand visa and green card programs ultimately may be required for the CHIPS Act to fulfill its promise to drive advancements in semiconductor technology and strengthen the nation's position in the global tech ecosystem.\n\nPotential Employment Law Risks\n\nThe rapid growth in hiring across the semiconductor industry to meet the goals of the CHIPS Act is not without legal risks. Hiring and interview processes can lend themselves to claims of discrimination from those who do not land interviews or receive job offers. Foreign national candidates may claim they were rejected due to their national origin, race, or ethnicity.\n\nWhile technology companies will likely turn to seek foreign talent to meet the ambitious CHIPS Act, companies should ensure their hiring programs focus on identifying the most talented candidate, regardless of protected characteristics. This is particularly true in light of the increased challenges to employer diversity, equity, and inclusion initiatives and job actions, including hiring programs, following the U.S. Supreme Court's 2023 decision in Students for Fair Admissions, Inc. v. President and Fellows of Harvard College/UNC.\n\nTo hire at the necessary scale, some employers may turn to software solutions to automatically rate, rank, or score candidates early in the process -- delivering only the most qualified applicants to human eyes for review and consideration. This approach follows the trend of increasing the use of artificial intelligence in human resources practices. These screening tools also can present increased risks of potential adverse impact, however, and are a priority of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's Strategic Enforcement Plan Fiscal Years 2024-2028.\n\nIn addition to the greater scrutiny on hiring programs, there is rising interest in removing the \"adverse action\" requirement from plaintiffs' prima facie case in discrimination claims. The U.S. Supreme Court heard arguments in Muldrow v. City of St. Louis, in which the Court considered whether discrimination itself could be sufficient harm for a claim under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act, regardless of whether the plaintiff suffered any monetary impact. Proponents of the change have noted that nothing in the law requires plaintiffs to prove they suffered an adverse action to sustain a claim. Rather, the mere fact that their race, national origin, or some other protected category was a factor in the adverse employment action is enough to make a claim of discrimination. With this issue under review by the Supreme Court, the law may move in this direction. Thus, it will be even more important to review hiring initiatives to avoid any potential inference of discrimination, even if an individual cannot point to a tangible adverse action in support of their claims.",

        "title": "PureTech Year End Update and Outlook for 2024",
        "body": "BOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)--Dec 20, 2023--\n\nPureTech Health plc (Nasdaq: PRTC, LSE: PRTC) (\"PureTech\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage biotherapeutics company dedicated to changing the lives of patients with devastating diseases, today reports on the key progress made across its Wholly Owned Programs 2 and Founded Entities 3 in 2023, announces two new Founded Entities and provides an update on cash and operational runway guidance.\n\nKey Highlights:\n\nStrong progress in 2023 included the successful LYT-300 clinical trial of acute anxiety in healthy adults and initial data from ongoing clinical trials of LYT-200 in solid tumors and acute myeloid leukemia, along with Royalty Pharma deal of up to $500M, as well as clinical and regulatory advances across multiple Wholly Owned Programs and Founded Entities.PureTech continues to build and will further expand its Wholly Owned Pipeline focus in pulmonary and rare diseases. Certain Glyph TM intellectual property will remain at PureTech. Key catalysts expected in 2024 include results from idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) late-stage trial of LYT-100 in Q4 2024.New clinical-stage neuroscience Founded Entity: Seaport Therapeutics will advance certain central nervous system (CNS) programs and relevant Glyph intellectual property. Rapid growth of neuroscience pipeline, powered by Glyph platform, including new therapeutic candidate announced today (LYT-320), and initiations of two clinical trials in 2024 (LYT-300 and LYT-310).New clinical-stage oncology Founded Entity: Gallop Oncology to advance LYT-200 and other galectin-9 intellectual property; additional results from clinical trials in leukemia and solid tumors expected in 2024.Robust balance sheet position with estimated Consolidated Cash, Cash Equivalents and Short-Term Investments at year end of approximately $320 million 1, extends operational runway guidance into 2027 based on the Company's strategic operating plan.The PureTech Board may declare special dividends and/or share buybacks as part of an overall returns strategy.\n\nDaphne Zohar, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of PureTech, commented: \"PureTech has had a particularly productive year. One of the advantages of the hub-and-spoke model we pioneered is that it has enabled us to build an exciting pipeline of new medicines poised for tremendous growth, without diluting our shareholders in almost seven years. Our Founded Entities are a significant source of value to us, and we have generated over $800 million in non-dilutive proceeds to advance our pipeline and growth since 2020.\n\n\"A good example of how our successful model has funded our pipeline and operations is our strategic deal with Royalty Pharma acquiring an interest in our royalty in KarXT for up to $500 million, which provided us with upfront non-dilutive capital and significant upside based on Karuna's future regulatory and commercial successes.\n\n\"I'm also proud of our track record which includes 80 percent 4 success across clinical trials, with a probability of clinical success that is six times better than the industry average 5.\n\n\"Advancing programs to a key value inflection point before determining the most expedient and cost-effective path forward is a hallmark of our hub-and-spoke business model, and we've seen the success of it realized in the U.S. FDA clearance of two medicines, a third that has recently filed for approval, and several additional therapeutic candidates being advanced through late-stage clinical trials. This model allows us to create and advance new medicines in a capital efficient manner. Importantly, the strategic decision announced today to advance certain programs through two new Founded Entities will make it easier for the true value of these programs to be recognized and, as they continue to advance, deliver the greatest value back to our shareholders.\n\n\"We are extremely proud of the numerous accomplishments made by our team in 2023 and look forward to a productive and exciting 2024, where we expect to deliver multiple milestones to improve the lives of patients and drive benefit to our shareholders.\"\n\nAdditional highlights and progress include the following:\n\nOutlook for 2024, new Founded Entities and execution of corporate strategy\n\nBuilding on the success of early studies for LYT-100, and with the important upcoming catalyst for IPF in 2024, PureTech will continue to build on its internal expertise in pulmonary and rare diseases and expanding its portfolio in those therapeutic areas. Certain Glyph intellectual property will remain at PureTech.PureTech is reinforcing the proven success of its model by adding two new \"spokes\" to the PureTech \"hub.\" PureTech will be advancing its programs in two important therapeutic areas (neuroscience and oncology respectively) in two new clinical-stage Founded Entities, Seaport Therapeutics and Gallop Oncology.The launch of Seaport Therapeutics will accelerate the development of new neuroscience medicines in areas of high unmet need with the addition of capital partners to bring nearer-term patient benefit. It also builds on the success PureTech has achieved in the neuroscience arena with the same strategy and team at PureTech that invented KarXT. If approved, KarXT will be the third therapeutic candidate to be taken from inception at PureTech to FDA regulatory approval and will represent the first new mechanism of action for patients with schizophrenia in over 50 years.The launch of Gallop Oncology builds on the promising clinical and preclinical data from PureTech's LYT-200 program in solid tumors and hematological malignancies. The development of a novel oncology medicine requires a dedicated effort that is best enabled through a separate Founded Entity and external capital.\n\nWholly Owned Programs\n\nLYT-100 (deupirfenidone) is currently in development for the treatment of IPF, which is a rare, progressive, and fatal disease. While existing standard-of-care treatments are effective, they cause significant side effects, and as a result, three out of four people living with IPF in the U.S. forego treatment. LYT-100, which has shown 50 percent reduction of the GI and overall adverse events compared to pirfenidone in a head-to-head study, has the potential to both supplant the current standard-of-care treatments and to serve a larger population of patients who are unable to tolerate current therapies.Progressed a Phase 2b dose-ranging trial of LYT-100 in patients with IPF. Topline results are expected in Q4 2024. PureTech plans to pursue a streamlined development program for LYT-100 in IPF and is using the same validated endpoints that have supported past approvals. PureTech believes the results of the ongoing trial, together with an additional registration study in Phase 3, could serve as the basis for registration in the U.S. and other geographies.Presented expanded data at the CHEST Annual Meeting 2023 from a completed trial of LYT-100 in healthy older adults, which informed the two doses selected for the ongoing Phase 2b trial (ELEVATE IPF). In addition to supporting the improved tolerability of LYT-100 versus the FDA-approved dose of pirfenidone, the new data presented supported the selection of a higher dose of LYT-100 with the potential for improved efficacy that is now being evaluated in ELEVATE IPF.\n\nNewly Announced Founded Entities:\n\nSeaport Therapeutics:LYT-300 (oral Glyph-allopregnanolone) is an oral prodrug of allopregnanolone, enabled by the Glyph platform, that is currently in development for the treatment of both neuropsychiatric and rare CNS conditions. Allopregnanolone has demonstrated benefit in a range of CNS conditions, but it can only be administered via IV, which has hindered its broad therapeutic use. Using the Glyph platform, LYT-300 retains the activity and potency of endogenous allopregnanolone in an oral form.Successful topline results from a Phase 2a proof-of-concept trial of LYT-300 using a validated clinical model of anxiety in healthy volunteers were reported recently. Oral administration of LYT-300 achieved the trial's primary endpoint of a statistically significant reduction versus placebo in the increase from baseline to peak levels of the stress hormone salivary cortisol (p=0.0001) with a treatment effect size versus placebo of 0.72, measured by the Cohen's D.LYT-300 is advancing into a Phase 2 clinical trial for the treatment of Fragile X-associated Tremor/ Ataxia Syndrome (FXTAS), which is a rare neurological disease. A Phase 2 trial is expected to initiate in 2024. PureTech was chosen to receive up to $11.4 million from the U.S. Department of Defense through a highly competitive grant process to advance LYT-300 in FXTAS.LYT-310 (oral Glyph-cannabidiol [CBD]), is currently in development for the treatment of epilepsies and other neurological indications. A different CBD-based product purified from plant sources, has received regulatory approval in the U.S. and Europe to treat seizures resulting from certain rare conditions, but it requires a large volume of a sesame oil-based formulation, which limits its use in broader indications and age groups.\n\nNew today: Preclinical data demonstrated LYT-310 was effective in preventing seizures in the Maximal Electroshock Model (MES), a validated and highly translatable preclinical model considered a gold standard for the assessment of anti-seizure drugs. LYT-310 was tested against various formulations of CBD, including an oral CBD formulation in sesame oil. LYT-310 showed strong anti-seizure protection activity and was shown to be more effective at preventing seizures at a dose three times lower than an oral CBD formulation. Based on the data, LYT-310 has the potential to expand the use of CBD to broader patient populations, particularly in populations and conditions where higher doses are required to achieve a therapeutic effect.\n\nInitiation of a Phase 1 clinical trial of LYT-310 is expected in the first half of 2024.\n\nNew today: LYT-320 (oral Glyph-agomelatine), was nominated as a new therapeutic candidate powered by PureTech's Glyph platform. A novel prodrug of agomelatine, LYT-320 is in development for the treatment of anxiety and mood disorders. Anxiety disorders affect nearly 30 percent of U.S. adults 6 and are an area of significant unmet need.\n\nLYT-320 uses the Glyph platform to bypass first-pass metabolism by the liver and thus has the potential to reduce liver exposure, hepatotoxicity, and the need for liver function monitoring.Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs) and serotonin and norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors (SNRIs) are first-line treatments for generalized anxiety disorder (GAD) and depressive disorders but have side effects and efficacy limitations. A major limitation of SSRIs and SNRIs are adverse events such as sexual dysfunction and emotional blunting.Agomelatine acts through a completely different mechanism of action and offers superior overall tolerability for patients compared to standard-of-care. The drug has demonstrated clear human efficacy in multiple studies of GAD where the gold-standard Hamilton Anxiety Rating Scale (HAM-A) was used as the primary endpoint. Agomelatine is approved for major depressive disorder (MDD) in the European Union and for MDD and GAD in Australia. Agomelatine has not been approved in the U.S., offering LYT-320 first-in-class potential for the U.S. market and best-in-class potential in the rest of the world. However, agomelatine is associated with hepatoxicity necessitating extensive liver function monitoring that has held back its use. Agomelatine has very low oral bioavailability (approximately one percent) due to extensive hepatic first-pass metabolism, potentially contributing to hepatoxicity.In multiple in vivo studies, LYT-320 showed oral bioavailability and plasma exposures greater than 10-fold higher than orally dosed agomelatine. Exposures comparable to approved therapeutic agomelatine doses could thus be enabled by LYT-320 comprising a reduced dose of agomelatine, which in silico modeling using the FDA-licensed DILIsym platform, has projected will greatly reduce the risk of causing clinically significant liver enzyme elevations.Initiation of first-in-human enabling studies is expected in 2024 and LYT-320 is expected to advance into clinical studies in the first half of 2025.\n\nGallop Oncology:\n\nLYT-200 (anti-galectin-9 mAb) is in development for the treatment of metastatic/locally advanced solid tumors, including head and neck and urothelial cancers, and hematological malignancies, such as acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and high-risk myelodysplastic syndromes (MDS). A wide variety of preclinical data support the potential clinical efficacy of LYT-200 and the importance of galectin-9 as a target and suggests a potential opportunity for biomarker development.Presented data from the ongoing Phase 1 clinical trial of LYT-200 at the ESMO Immuno-Oncology Congress 2023. In the initial results, LYT-200 demonstrated a favorable safety profile in all cohorts, including the monotherapy and combination arms with BeiGene's tislelizumab, and showed disease control and suggestions of initial anti-tumor activity. In the combination arm, 11 patients have been dosed, and all evaluable patients treated so far include four patients with head and neck cancers and two patients with urothelial cancer. In the evaluable patients with head and neck cancers, disease control was observed in three of the four patients, with one patient experiencing a complete response after nine months, one patient with a deepening partial response after eight months, and one patient with disease stabilization at four months so far, with treatment in these patients remains ongoing. The two evaluable patients with urothelial cancer experienced disease stabilization for seven months and three months, so far, and both remain on treatment. The combination arm continues to enroll patients with head and neck and urothelial cancers. Completion of the trial and results are expected by the end of 2024.New today: In the ongoing Phase 1b trial evaluating LYT-200 as a single agent in relapsed/refractory AML and MDS patients, three dose escalation cohorts have completed to date at weekly doses of 2 mg/kg (cohort 1), 4 mg/kg (cohort 2) and 7.5 mg/kg (cohort 3). In a heavily pre-treated patient population, the early data demonstrates a favorable safety and tolerability profile of LYT-200 with no dose limiting toxicities. In the first cohort, disease stabilization was observed in two of the five patients treated, with one patient achieving red blood cell transfusion independence. In the second cohort, disease stabilization was observed in two of the four patients treated. In the third cohort, disease stabilization was observed in all four of the patients treated, with a reduction in bone marrow blasts observed in two of the four patients and the clearance of peripheral blasts observed in one patient. Two patients achieved more than 50 percent bone marrow blast reduction, with one of these patients observing an increase in platelet count without transfusions. The fourth cohort, evaluating a weekly regimen of LYT-200 at the 12 mg/kg dose, is still ongoing. The part 2 portion of the Phase 1b trial evaluating LYT-200 in combination with venetoclax and hypomethylating agents is also ongoing. PureTech plans to present additional data from the trial in a scientific forum in 2024.\n\nFounded Entities:\n\nKaruna Therapeutics (Nasdaq: KRTX) (Karuna)Announced the U.S. Food and Drug Administration has accepted its New Drug Application (NDA) for KarXT (xanomeline-trospium) for the treatment of schizophrenia in adults.

        "title": "Predictive Analytics in Remote Patient Monitoring: Revolutionizing Early Intervention Strategies | Hi Tech Gazette",
        "body": "As the healthcare landscape continues its steady metamorphosis, predictive analytics emerges as a paramount force in redefining Remote Patient Monitoring (RPM). Predictive analytics, harnessing the potency of data-driven algorithms, deep learning, and artificial intelligence, delves into a reservoir of health-related data, from demographic intricacies to nuanced medical records and lifestyle patterns. By 2028, the healthcare predictive analytics sector is poised for an explosive growth of over 22%, a testament to its transformative capabilities.\n\nWithin the ambit of RPM, predictive analytics doesn't just offer a vantage point into potential health trajectories but fundamentally reshapes early intervention strategies.\n\nFrom a valuation of $23.2 billion in 2020, the global RPM market is on a trajectory to achieve a staggering $117.1 billion by 2025. This growth underscores the increasing importance of RPM in modern healthcare. By incorporating vital elements such as real-time data acquisition, patient alerts, and telehealth consultations, RPM is establishing itself as a cornerstone of efficient healthcare delivery.\n\nFurther, when predictive analytics, equipped with advanced algorithms like neural networks, decision trees, and support vector machines, intertwines with RPM, the potential for business growth is significantly amplified.\n\nHarnessing methodologies like big data analysis, natural language processing, and deep learning, this amalgamation interprets vast health datasets, ranging from demographic intricacies to detailed medical histories. Through the lens of AI, predictive patterns emerge, enabling healthcare businesses to anticipate treatment needs and develop bespoke therapeutic solutions.\n\nIn the vast landscape of RPM, the infusion of predictive modeling techniques is transforming the paradigm from passive observation to proactive intervention. Predominantly, there are two distinct approaches underpinning these techniques.\n\nFirstly, equation-based models, anchored in established mathematical frameworks, meticulously elucidate the interplay between variables, drawing from techniques like time-series regression and linear forecasting.\n\nSuch methodologies, renowned for their precision, particularly thrive when vast amounts of data are available and when the outcome variable is comprehensively characterized. Yet, their deterministic nature can sometimes grapple with the ever-evolving dynamics of patient health, especially when the interconnectedness of variables is intricate or shifts over time.\n\nIn contrast, the computational modeling paradigm, often termed a \"black box\" approach, veers away from traditional equation-based narratives. Harnessing the potency of machine learning, techniques such as neural networks and bagged decision trees decipher patterns within health data, autonomously navigating the labyrinth of potential health risks and gauging the immediacy of interventions. Neural networks and bagged decision trees, for instance, have found applications in diverse fields, from determining a borrower's credit rating to pinpointing a wine's origin.\n\nA staggering 86% of all the dollars spent in health care, amounting to over $3.4 trillion in 2019, are directed toward one set of conditions: chronic diseases. These conditions are not only financially burdensome but are also responsible for 70 to 75% of all deaths. Predictive analytics has risen to this challenge, playing a pivotal role in the proactive management and prevention of chronic diseases, especially within the RPM domain.\n\nThese models meticulously construct patient-centric baselines, factoring in components like age, gender, and family medical history. With these benchmarks in place, any deviation becomes detectable in near real-time. Central to the efficacy of these RPM paradigms is their unparalleled competency in pattern discernment.\n\nFor instance, when faced with a lineage of hereditary chronic conditions, predictive algorithms can forecast the probability of disease manifestation by comparing patient data with historical patterns. By identifying irregularities such as erratic heart rhythms or abrupt shifts in vital signs, these systems offer an early warning, emphasizing potential deterioration well before clinical symptoms manifest.\n\nIt is evident that there are both significant challenges to address and promising solutions to consider. Businesses keen on harnessing the potential of this merger should be well-versed in these complexities to ensure optimal patient care while securing their position in this evolving landscape.\n\nFor healthcare organizations pondering the integration of these potent technologies, here's a structured blueprint to augment both patient outcomes and organizational growth:\n\nIn the rapidly unfolding narrative of healthcare, the synergy between predictive analytics and RPM stands out as a beacon of innovation. This dynamic pairing promises a future where early interventions and optimal patient care become the norm rather than the exception. For businesses, this integration isn't just about technological fusion; it's about unlocking new horizons of growth, carving out competitive advantages, and embracing an era where patient well-being and business prosperity walk hand in hand.",

Poolbeg believes the data obtained reflects the high potential of this AI-led programme and supports its partnering efforts.\n\nThe global interest in AI-led drug discovery continues to grow, with major pharmaceutical players making substantial investments in the field. Poolbeg's RSV AI programme identified these drug treatment candidates in just 10 months. AI-led drug discovery can accelerate the timeline achievable which reduces costs while also decreasing risks and providing a higher likelihood of success in bringing groundbreaking therapies to patients.\n\nJeremy Skillington, PhD, Chief Executive Officer of Poolbeg Pharma, commented: \"The positive outputs from this analysis, and the successful prioritisation of our RSV drug candidates, is a testament to the power of our AI-led drug discovery programme.

        "body": "One company uses AI to find an optimal flight route around risky areas, saving fuel and increasing safety\n\nSpotted: Turbulence, responsible for a third of all weather-related aircraft accidents, has often been seen as a barrier to meeting climate goals in aviation. This is because some argue that, to reduce turbulence and increase safety, airlines must sacrifice being fuel efficient.\n\nHowever, Nabla Mobility claims there does not need to be a trade-off. The Japanese company is using Artificial Intelligence (AI) and machine learning to prove that safety and efficiency can work together simultaneously in the skies.\n\nThe technology, called Untangled, creates a comprehensive plan to avoid turbulence while optimising fuel. To do this, the software offers turbulence prediction that accurately pinpoints and identifies various turbulence types. Additionally, it boasts an innovative feature known as altitude optimisation-based turbulence avoidance, enabling flights to steer clear of turbulence and save fuel.\n\nThe model's final feature accurately forecasts fuel usage to determine the most cost-effective flight path, crafting an optimised route. Nabla Mobility claims its Untangled solution can deliver four to five per cent more efficient fuel usage during the cruise phase without requiring any hardware modifications, irrespective of an aircraft's age or the type of fuel it utilises.\n\nEstablished in 2022, this company is actively engaged in researching and developing its pioneering technology. Once launched, the software will be the first of its kind in the market.\n\nSpringwise has previously spotted other innovations aimed at making the aviation industry more sustainable, from a platform to help create carbon-neutral aviation fuel to an aircraft powered by liquid hydrogen.",

        "title": "Decoding Accenture PLC (ACN): A Strategic SWOT Insight",
        "body": "On December 19, 2023, Accenture PLC (ACN, Financial), a global powerhouse in IT services, released its 10-Q filing, revealing a financial snapshot that investors and market analysts eagerly anticipate. The company reported revenues of $16.22 billion, a modest increase from the previous year's $15.75 billion. This uptick is a testament to Accenture's enduring appeal in the consulting and technology services market. Operating income stood at $2.56 billion, slightly down from $2.59 billion, while net income attributable to Accenture PLC was $1.97 billion, up from $1.96 billion. Earnings per share also saw a slight increase, indicating a stable financial performance. The company's ability to maintain a strong balance sheet amidst global economic fluctuations is a key highlight, positioning it well for future growth and investment opportunities.\n\nMarket Leadership and Brand Reputation: Accenture PLC (ACN, Financial) continues to solidify its position as a leader in the IT services industry. The company's brand is synonymous with innovation and excellence, which is reflected in its consistent revenue growth. The latest SEC filing indicates a year-over-year increase in revenues, underscoring Accenture's ability to attract and retain a diverse client base across various sectors. This strength is further bolstered by the company's global presence, with operations in over 200 cities across 51 countries, providing a broad and resilient platform for growth.\n\nFinancial Robustness: Accenture's financial health remains a cornerstone of its competitive advantage. The company's strong balance sheet, evidenced by a net income increase and solid earnings per share, demonstrates its operational efficiency and profitability. Accenture's financial discipline allows for strategic investments in growth areas such as digital transformation, cloud services, and cybersecurity, ensuring the company stays ahead of the curve in a rapidly evolving market.\n\nCompetitive Pricing Pressures: The IT services market is highly competitive, with constant pressure on pricing strategies. Accenture's operating margin has experienced a slight contraction, which may be indicative of the competitive landscape where clients seek more value at lower costs. To maintain its market position, Accenture must navigate these pressures without compromising on service quality or profitability, which could be challenging in an environment where new entrants are continuously disrupting pricing norms.\n\nDependence on Global Operations: While Accenture's global footprint is a strength, it also exposes the company to geopolitical risks and economic fluctuations across different regions. The complexity of managing operations across multiple jurisdictions can lead to inefficiencies and increased costs, potentially impacting the company's bottom line. Moreover, the need to comply with diverse regulatory frameworks can pose challenges in terms of agility and speed of response to market changes.\n\nDigital Transformation Demand: The ongoing demand for digital transformation services presents a significant opportunity for Accenture. As organizations across industries seek to modernize their operations and leverage emerging technologies, Accenture's expertise in areas such as cloud computing, artificial intelligence, and data analytics positions it to capture a larger share of this growing market. The company's strategic focus on innovation and technology leadership can drive long-term growth and client acquisition.\n\nStrategic Acquisitions: Accenture has a history of strategic acquisitions that enhance its service offerings and expand its market reach. The company's financial strength provides the capacity to pursue further acquisitions, enabling it to enter new markets, acquire cutting-edge technologies, and access specialized talent. This proactive approach to growth through acquisitions can fuel Accenture's expansion and diversification efforts.\n\nTechnological Disruption: The rapid pace of technological change poses a threat to Accenture's business model. As new technologies emerge, the company must continuously invest in research and development to stay relevant. There is a risk that Accenture may not be able to adapt quickly enough to changing client demands or that it may face increased competition from niche players with specialized technological capabilities.\n\nRegulatory and Compliance Risks: Accenture's operations are subject to a complex web of regulations across different countries. Changes in laws, tax policies, or regulatory standards can have significant implications for the company's business practices and cost structures. Ensuring compliance while maintaining operational efficiency requires constant vigilance and can divert resources away from core business activities.\n\nIn conclusion, Accenture PLC (ACN, Financial) exhibits a strong market position with a robust financial foundation, as evidenced by its latest SEC 10-Q filing. The company's strengths in brand reputation and financial health are tempered by challenges such as competitive pricing pressures and the complexities of global operations. However, opportunities in digital transformation and strategic acquisitions present pathways for growth. Accenture must remain vigilant against threats from technological disruption and regulatory changes to sustain its market leadership and drive shareholder value.",

        "title": "Evaluating brain tumors with artificial intelligence",
        "body": "Best paper award: Outstanding publication by TU researchers recognized\n\nThe information systems department of TU Darmstadt regularly achieves very good rankings, such as second place in the university ranking of the magazine \"WirtschaftsWoche\". The research results are also impressive. An international team of researchers from TU Darmstadt, the University of Cambridge, the science and technology company Merck, and the Klinikum rechts der Isar of TU Munich, studied in an international and interdisciplinary collaboration how software systems collect, process, and evaluate task-specific relevant information, thereby supporting the work of humans, in this case, radiologists. The study, now awarded with the Best Paper Award, provides empirical data on the influence of machine learning systems (ML systems) on human learning. It also shows how important it is for end users whether the results of machine learning methods are comprehensible and understandable. These insights are not only relevant for medical diagnoses in radiology, but for everyone who becomes a reviewer of ML output through the daily use of AI tools, such as ChatGPT.\n\nMachine Learning in Radiology\n\nThe research project, led by TU researchers Sara Ellenrieder and Professor Peter Buxmann, investigated the use of ML-based decision support systems in radiology, specifically in the manual segmentation of brain tumours in MRI images. The focus was on how radiologists can learn from these systems to improve their performance and decision-making confidence. The authors compared different performance levels of ML systems and analyzed how explaining the ML output improved the radiologists' understanding of the results. The research aim is to find out how radiologists can benefit from these systems in the long term and use them safely.\n\nFor this purpose, the project team conducted an experiment with radiologists from various clinics. The physicians were asked to segment tumours in MRI images before and after receiving ML-based decision support. Different groups were provided with ML systems of varying performance or explainability. In addition to collecting quantitative performance data during the experiment, the researchers also gathered qualitative data through \"think-aloud\" protocols and subsequent interviews.\n\nResults\n\nIn the experiment, 690 manual segmentations of brain tumours were performed by the radiologists. The results show that radiologists can learn from the information provided by high-performing ML systems. Through interaction, they improved their performance. However, the study also shows that a lack of explainability of ML output in low-performing systems can lead to a decline in performance among radiologists. Interestingly, providing explanations of the ML output not only improved the learning outcomes of the radiologists but also prevented learning false information. In fact, some physicians were even able to learn from mistakes made by low-performing, but explainable systems.\n\n\"The future of human-AI collaboration lies in the development of explainable and transparent AI systems that enable end users in particular to learn from the systems and make better decisions in the long term,\" summarises Professor Peter Buxmann from TU Darmstadt.\n\nThe publication\n\nSara Ellenrieder, Emma Marlene Kallina, Luisa Pumplun, Joshua Felix Gawlitza, Sebastian Ziegelmayer, Peter Buxmann: Promoting Learning Through Explainable Artificial Intelligence: An Experimental Study in Radiology\n\nTU Darmstadt is one of Germany's leading technical universities and a synonym for excellent, relevant research.

        "body": "Is EPAM Systems (EPAM) Poised for Growth Beyond Its Current Valuation?\n\nEPAM Systems Inc (EPAM, Financial) has recently experienced a daily decrease of 1.65% in its stock price, yet it boasts a 3-month gain of 12.38%. With an Earnings Per Share (EPS) of $8.02, investors are contemplating whether the stock is modestly undervalued. This article aims to explore EPAM Systems' valuation, encouraging readers to delve into the following detailed analysis to uncover the stock's true market potential.\n\nEPAM Systems Inc (EPAM, Financial) is a leading global IT services provider, specializing in platform engineering, software development, and consulting services. With North America accounting for roughly 60% of its revenue, EPAM Systems is at the forefront of integrating new technologies such as artificial intelligence, virtual reality, and robotics into its offerings. The company's current stock price stands at $295.4 per share, while the GF Value estimates its fair value at $406.18, hinting at a modest undervaluation. This valuation discrepancy sets the stage for a deeper investigation into EPAM Systems' financial health and market positioning.\n\nThe GF Value is a unique metric that calculates the intrinsic value of a stock based on historical trading multiples, a GuruFocus adjustment factor reflecting past performance and growth, and projected future business outcomes. If a stock's price greatly exceeds the GF Value Line, it may be overvalued, leading to potentially lower future returns. Conversely, a price well below the GF Value Line could indicate an undervalued stock with the prospect of higher returns. For EPAM Systems, the current price suggests a modest undervaluation, which could signal more favorable long-term returns than the company's business growth alone might indicate.\n\nInvesting in companies with robust financial strength is crucial to avoid permanent capital loss. EPAM Systems' cash-to-debt ratio of 11.1 places it above 69.09% of its peers in the Software industry. This solid financial foundation earns EPAM Systems a financial strength rating of 8 out of 10 from GuruFocus, indicating a strong balance sheet.\n\nProfitable companies, particularly those with consistent long-term profitability, pose less investment risk. EPAM Systems has maintained profitability for the past decade, with a trailing twelve-month revenue of $4.80 billion and an operating margin of 12.07%, outperforming 77.5% of companies in the Software industry. GuruFocus ranks EPAM Systems' profitability at a perfect 10 out of 10.\n\nAdditionally, growth is a pivotal valuation factor, often linked to a company's long-term stock performance. EPAM Systems' 3-year average revenue growth rate surpasses 82.1% of its competitors, while its EBITDA growth rate of 19.8% is higher than 67.13% of similar companies, indicating a robust growth trajectory.\n\nThe comparison between a company's Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) and its Weighted Average Cost of Capital (WACC) is another measure of profitability. EPAM Systems' ROIC of 21.8 is significantly higher than its WACC of 14.23, indicating that the company is effectively creating shareholder value.\n\nEPAM Systems (EPAM, Financial) presents itself as modestly undervalued, backed by strong financial health and impressive profitability. Its growth outpaces a significant portion of the Software industry, suggesting potential for above-average returns. For a comprehensive understanding of EPAM Systems' financial journey, interested parties are encouraged to examine its 30-Year Financials here.\n\nTo uncover high-quality companies that may deliver above-average returns, visit the GuruFocus High Quality Low Capex Screener.",

        "title": "Evaxion Announces Business Update and Third Quarter 2023 Financial Results",
        "body": "COPENHAGEN, Denmark, Dec. 19, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Evaxion Biotech A/S (NASDAQ: EVAX) (\"Evaxion\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage TechBio company specializing in developing AI-Immunology™ powered vaccines, today provided a business update and announced its third quarter 2023 financial results.\n\nChristian Kanstrup, Evaxion's CEO, reports, \"It has been a great pleasure to join Evaxion, and the first three months have confirmed my belief in a world-class organization and business with strong potential for addressing significant unmet needs within cancer and infectious diseases. Our AI-Immunology™ platform offers unique opportunities in this connection. A key focus for the first months has been to refine the Evaxion strategy with a strong focus on execution and value realization.\n\n\"I am pleased to be able to share the refined strategy in a simple, straightforward overview below. The core of our strategy lies in our pioneering AI-Immunology™ platform, which has been continuously refined and validated over the past many years. This platform holds the potential for generating one new target every 24 hours, is delivery modality agnostic, and is easily adaptable to partner needs. Based on the unique multi-disciplinary capabilities built around our different AI prediction models, we focus on value realization via Targets, Pipeline and Responders. We have already seen substantial progress within each of these three areas: two partnerships announced within Targets and encouraging initial EVX-01 Phase 2 data showcase significant progress in our Pipeline. Within Responders, we have obtained proof-of-principle for our checkpoint inhibitor responder model.\n\n\"The refined strategy also means reduced focus on Evaxion-driven clinical trials, significantly reducing the cash burn. Combined with a stronger focus on value realization based upon our AI-Immunology™ platform, we have the ambition of being able to generate full-year 2024 business development income equal to our cash burn in 2024, excluding financing activities. We believe we are set for strong business execution based on our refined strategy.\"\n\nChristian Kanstrup continued, \"I am also very pleased with the bridge financing round we just priced. It is an important element in our long-term financing strategy. The investor base in the round consists of existing investors, management, and the board of directors, as well as new investors. The largest new investor is MSD Global Health Innovation Fund (MSD GHI), the corporate venture capital arm of Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA, accounting for some 25% of the private placement. I am looking very much forward to be working with the capable team from MSD GHI. We believe this financing round shows strong confidence in our future business outlook.\n\n\"We are also excited to see that the validation of the AI-Immunology™ platform has continued. The EDEN™ AI prediction model has been validated for B-cell antigen discovery across seven different pathogens and formed a central component of the two important partnerships Evaxion entered into during the third quarter. One of these partnerships brings together AI-discovered antigens and mRNA technology - a first in the Evaxion pipeline. EDEN™ and the T-cell epitope discovery model, RAVEN™, are pivotal components of the other partnership forged with a leading pharmaceutical company to discover and develop vaccines against a pathogen with high unmet medical need for which no vaccines are available. Evaxion plans to build on this momentum and leverage our AI-Immunology™ platform to pursue new partnerships for novel vaccine targets within infectious diseases.\n\n\"This quarter has also seen significant developments in our cancer portfolio and capabilities. A comprehensive clinical update on the EVX-01 Phase 2 trial shared at the SITC conference confirms the encouraging Phase 1 immune profile seen for our lead personalized cancer vaccine asset. This achievement solidifies our confidence in the potential AI-Immunology™ holds at becoming a new treatment paradigm for metastatic melanoma.\n\n\"Another truly exciting element in the AI-Immunology™ platform is the ObsERV™ model, which is unique to Evaxion and allows us to harness a new source of tumor-specific antigens in oncology patients. With ObsERV™, we hope to expand the therapeutic reach of personalized cancer vaccines to patients with high mutational burden tumors but low numbers of high-quality neoantigens and patients with low tumor mutational burden who would otherwise not qualify for many of the treatment options available today. One exciting possibility we are currently looking into is whether we could use ObsERV™ to identify shared cancer antigens in particular cancer subtypes. This would hold the promise to develop the first precision cancer vaccines targeting indications with no equivalent treatment option to date. Details on this principle were shared at ASH in December this year.\n\n\"With the recent development within cancer and infectious diseases, we have been seeing a further confirmation of our approach and are looking forward to discussing partnering opportunities across all parts of our strategy and associated with our three-pronged business model: Targets, Pipeline, and Responders.\"\n\nChristian Kanstrup Leads Evaxion's AI Strategy as CEO\n\nEvaxion appoints Christian Kanstrup as CEO, emphasizing his unique leadership and strategic development skills. Kanstrup's vision aims to harness the full potential of Evaxion's AI platform for therapeutic innovation.\n\nEvaxion's EDEN™ Model Validated: Revolutionizing Vaccine Development\n\nEvaxion shared data at the Vaccines Europe conference validating the EDEN™ model for bacterial vaccine discovery. This groundbreaking achievement emphasizes the models' ability to swiftly generate novel vaccine targets, offering a faster, cheaper, and lower-risk approach to vaccine development. CEO Christian Kanstrup and Founder Andreas Holm Mattsson highlight its potential impact on high unmet medical needs, signaling a paradigm shift in vaccine discovery.\n\nEvaxion Initiates AI-Designed Vaccine Program EVX-B3 in Collaboration with Leading Pharmaceutical Partner\n\nEvaxion Biotech launches EVX-B3, an AI-guided vaccine program, in collaboration with a leading pharmaceutical company. Leveraging Evaxion's EDEN™ and RAVEN™ AI models, the project aims to efficiently identify protective antigens against an undisclosed bacterial pathogen, addressing a critical global health concern. The collaborative effort highlights Evaxion's dedication to harnessing AI for innovative vaccine design.\n\nEvaxion and Afrigen Join Forces for Gonorrhea mRNA Vaccine\n\nEvaxion Biotech partners with Afrigen Biologics to develop an mRNA vaccine against gonorrhea, utilizing EDEN™-discovered targets. The collaboration, leveraging mRNA technology from the WHO and Medicines Patent Pool, aims to address the global medical need for a gonorrhea vaccine. Evaxion CEO Christian Kanstrup sees this collaboration as a strategic step to bring AI-designed vaccines to market, emphasizing the importance of identifying the right partners.\n\nEvaxion's EVX-01 Phase 2 Trial Shows Promise in Personalized Cancer Treatment\n\nEvaxion Biotech reports encouraging Phase 2 data for its personalized cancer vaccine, EVX-01, confirming earlier Phase 1 findings. Notably, a metastatic melanoma patient with initial progressive disease showed significant and continuous tumor reduction after EVX-01 treatment. CEO Christian Kanstrup highlights the potential of their AI-Immunology™ platform to revolutionize oncology.\n\nWebinar: Evaxion Shares Insights on EVX-01 Phase 2 Clinical Data\n\nEvaxion Biotech hosted an online webinar on November 8 featuring KOL Professor Adnan Khattak, one of the principal investigators of the EVX-01 Phase 2 clinical trial. The 30-minute event explores malignant melanoma, summarizes Phase 1 results, and details the Phase 2 update.\n\nEvaxion Introduces AI Model for Predicting Cancer Immunotherapy Responses\n\nEvaxion unveils its AI model at the Biomarkers & Precision Oncology Europe conference, aiming to predict patient responses to cancer immunotherapy. The model shows promise in enhancing outcomes and reducing healthcare costs, aligning with Evaxion's commitment to advancing the AI-Immunology™ Responders area.\n\nEvaxion Unveils Innovative Precision Vaccine Concept for Hematological Malignancies\n\nEvaxion announces a groundbreaking precision vaccine concept for hematological malignancies at the 65th American Society of Hematology (ASH) Annual Meeting. The use of AI-Immunology™ to target endogenous retroviruses represents a significant advancement, offering tailored vaccines for hematological malignancies. The upcoming oral presentation on December 9 signifies a major milestone in Evaxion's pursuit of innovative cancer solutions.\n\nThird Quarter of 2023 Financial Results\n\nAbout EVAXION\n\nEvaxion Biotech A/S is a pioneering TechBio company based upon its AI platform: AI-Immunology™. Evaxion's proprietary and scalable AI prediction models harness the power of artificial intelligence to decode the human immune system and develop novel immunotherapies for cancer, bacterial diseases, and viral infections.

        "title": "7 'Bulletproof' Stocks to Buy Ahead of a Wild New Year",
        "body": "Visa (V): Swipe worries away, thriving on any spending climate with robust margins and analyst love.\n\nAlthough a new year tends to bring optimism in the market, current vagaries warrant a discussion about bulletproof stocks to buy for 2024. To be fair, even the most influential voices in government are hinting at a positive outcome. Nevertheless, nothing is guaranteed.\n\nFor example, Wall Street has responded positively to the Federal Reserve's apparent willingness to shift monetary policy. After roughly two years of aggressive interest rate hikes, Fed Chair Jerome Powell sees the possibility of lowering borrowing costs next year. On paper, that doesn't sound like the most ideal time to consider stable stocks. Rather, investors may want to consider higher-risk growth opportunities.\n\nStill, let's consider the context. With the U.S. jobs market continuing to print robust numbers, the idea of rate cuts seems premature. After all, that would imply expanding the inflation problem, not addressing it. As well, a global recession - which is a non-zero probability - would hurt risk-on assets.\n\nWith so many questions, investors should at least consider these bulletproof stocks to buy for 2024.\n\nWhat it is: Presenting about as self-explanatory of a company name as you can get, Waste Management (NYSE:WM) easily qualifies as one of the bulletproof stocks to buy for 2024. After all, the underlying business is a dirty job but someone has to do it. It's not particularly sexy but WM doesn't leave investors stranded for too long. Since the January opener, shares gained over 13%.\n\nRelevance: Unless you envision a world where humans don't produce trash, WM should belong on your list of stable stocks. Again, it's not a sexy growth opportunity. But what WM does is to provide confidence heading into an uncertain future. In particular, the company benefits from slow-and-steady revenue growth. Also, its gross margin comes in at around 37% to 38%, in line with historical norms.\n\nPros: Analysts appreciate the reliability of WM, rating it a moderate buy with a $182.44 price target. It also offers a modest dividend yield of 1.6%.\n\nCons: Basically, WM is the investment market's equivalent of a prevent defense. You buy it to secure the win, not necessarily to score a 70-yard bomb.\n\nWhat it is: Based in Newark, New Jersey, Public Service Enterprise (NYSE:PEG) is a diversified energy firm. Its biggest subsidiary is the Public Service Electric and Gas Company, a regulated gas and electric utility firm. Fundamentally, PEG should benefit from the natural monopoly effect. Essentially, utilities are too deeply entrenched in their chosen markets to be displaced.\n\nRelevance: If you're looking for bulletproof stocks to buy for 2024, it's difficult to overlook the utility space. According to accounting and consulting firm Deloitte, experts project that next year, electricity prices will remain steady. Further, sales should rise about 2%. We're not talking about groundbreaking stuff here. Instead, it's all about the consistent and predictable demand profile.\n\nPros: For bargain-hunting investors, PEG trades at a trailing-year earnings multiple of 10.98X. That's conspicuously lower than the sector median of 14.44x. Also, analysts peg shares as a moderate buy with a $64.90 price target.\n\nCons: The long-term chart performance of PEG has been slow indeed so it's good if you're literally seeking stable stocks.\n\nWhat it is: A financial services giant, Visa (NYSE:V) of course is known universally as a payment card provider. Per its public profile, the company facilitates electronic funds transfers throughout the world, most commonly through Visa-branded credit cards, debit cards and prepaid cards. While the sector presents risks, V has performed well, basically matching the performance of the S&P 500 this year.\n\nRelevance: If borrowing costs decline as the Fed seems to be hoping for, then Visa could rise on boosted consumer sentiment. Under any inflationary cycle (\"regular\" inflation up to hyperinflation), money today is worth more than money tomorrow. So, an incentive exists to spend that money today. However, if we fall into rough waters, cynically, consumers will turn to credit cards to make ends meet. That's already happening, actually.\n\nPros: Visa enjoys steady revenue growth and is consistently profitable thanks to its robust margins. Analysts also rate shares a consensus strong buy with a $281.74 price target.\n\nCons: With U.S. credit card debt collectively topping $1 trillion, a fundamental question exists about the viability of Visa as one of the bulletproof stocks.\n\nWhat it is: A company that truly needs no introduction, McDonald's (NYSE:MCD) is a powerhouse in the fast-food industry. Indeed, I would argue that it's a cultural icon representing American-style capitalism at its finest. After all, the brand's debut in the Soviet Union likely helped thaw the Cold War. Now, the company is seeking to reboot itself with its CosMc's spinoff.\n\nRelevance: Fundamentally, I believe McDonald's makes a great case as one of the stable stocks that could rise amid the challenges. With CosMc's, the Golden Arches is putting Starbucks (NASDAQ:SBUX) right in its crosshairs. By offering the customization options that consumers of Generation Z crave at a lower price point, MCD almost seems a no-brainer. I don't want to get ahead of myself but the new initiative is exciting.\n\nPros: Ironically, MCD isn't much of a discount in terms of valuation. However, the company enjoys solid revenue growth and consistent profitability via excellent margins. And who knows? MCD could be undervalued based on the future potential of CosMc's. Thus, it's one of the bulletproof stocks.\n\nCons: Despite the excitement over the spinoff, it will be tough to displace Starbucks.\n\nWhat it is: An American pharmaceutical company, AbbVie (NYSE:ABBV) offers a range of compelling therapeutics. Per its public profile, the company's primary product is Humira, which is approved to treat various autoimmune diseases. Further, thanks to its purchase of Allergan, AbbVie now controls Botox, which should be a big winner over the long run. Thus, it's one of the stable stocks to consider.\n\nRelevance: Generally speaking, blue-chip pharmaceuticals offer a level of economic insulation. Cynically, when people suffer from critical conditions, they often do whatever it takes to get better. For ABBV specifically, the global botulinum toxin - which is what Botox is - will reach a valuation of $11.1 billion at year's end. Further, the sector will expand at a compound annual growth rate (CAGR) of 9.8%, boding well for AbbVie.\n\nPros: Thanks to its robust profitability metrics, AbbVie offers a solid dividend yield of 3.84%. Analysts also rate shares a moderate buy with a $172.50 price target.\n\nCons: Admittedly, ABBV hasn't had the best performance this year as one of the bulletproof stocks.\n\nWhat it is: Another company that needs no introduction, Microsoft (NASDAQ:MSFT) is a computer software and hardware giant. While the company over the years has seen its dominance challenged from enterprises like Apple (NASDAQ:AAPL), the reality is that Microsoft owns the professional office application ecosystem. After all, when was the last time you forwarded a Numbers spreadsheet rather than an Excel file?\n\nRelevance: Again, while Microsoft has seen challenges to its digital hegemony, it still dominates in key areas. For example, in terms of desktop operating systems, Microsoft Windows commands a nearly 69% market share. In other words, the brand is practically ingrained in the broader digital space. Also, with Microsoft Office, the company enjoys consistent and predictable revenue growth.\n\nPros: While not the most exciting idea among bulletproof stocks, Microsoft brings to the table strong revenue growth and consistent profitability. As well, analysts peg shares a consensus strong buy with a $422.70 average price target.\n\nCons: MSFT already enjoyed a strong year in 2023 thanks to its initiatives in artificial intelligence. Therefore, it's questionable how much it can rise in 2024.\n\nWhat it is: A supermarket and multi-department store operator, Kroger (NYSE:KR) represents a stalwart in the grocery store industry. Fundamentally, KR attracts investors because of its everyday demand. Unless humans find a way to survive and thrive without convenient access to food and water, Kroger should rank among the stable stocks to buy for 2024.\n\nRelevance: While I don't expect meme traders to clamor over Kroger, the company should benefit no matter what happens with the economy. Let's say we enter a decisive bull market. Fine, people will still need to eat. If instead, we fall into a recession, Kroger should benefit from the trade-down effect. That is, households will likely eschew eating out at restaurants and cook at home, saving money.\n\nPros: One of the main factors favoring KR as one of the bulletproof stocks is the valuation. Trading at 10.14x forward earnings, it's well below the sector median of 15.4x. Also, analysts rate shares a moderate buy with a $51.36 price target.\n\nCons: Since June of last year, KR hasn't moved much so expectations need to be kept in check.",

        "title": "2024 Trends for Securing Your Business Premises: Essential Strategies and Technologies",
        "body": "As you look ahead to 2024, the landscape of physical security is evolving rapidly, with new trends emerging that could reshape how you protect your business premises.\n\nAdvances in technology, such as artificial intelligence, are playing a pivotal role in developing security solutions that are not only more efficient but also more sophisticated and adaptable to the changing threats.\n\nBeing aware of these trends is crucial for staying a step ahead of potential risks. Your security concerns must also take into account the ongoing geopolitical issues that influence the global security climate. This means being prepared for not just local threats but understanding that the actions of state actors and other large ill-intentioned groups can impact your business security as well.\n\nFrom integrating AI to enhance surveillance capabilities to cybersecurity measures that defend your digital interfaces, the coming year will demand a comprehensive approach to securing your assets.\n\nIt's also important to consider how advancements like machine learning can be incorporated into security strategies and what's their long-term potential. These technologies not only bolster defence mechanisms but also streamline the monitoring process, helping you respond to incidents with greater accuracy and speed.\n\nDeveloping a security strategy that leverages the latest trends will be essential in safeguarding your business against the sophisticated threats expected in 2024.\n\nTo fortify your security systems in a way that will protect you from evolving threats, you first need a clear, level-headed overview of the current state of cybersecurity.\n\nIn 2023, we've seen plenty of changes, and by analyzing them, we can come up with a solid estimation as to what the most prevalent attack vectors in 2024 will be.\n\nGenerative AI and machine learning have already transformed various industries -- but they are also becoming potent tools for cybercriminals, enabling them to craft attacks that are more convincing and harder to detect.\n\nYour cyber defences must adapt to these new threats, incorporating advanced AI to recognize threats and respond to such attacks proactively. The deployment of these technologies by adversaries necessitates fortifying your AI security measures to ensure that they remain resistant to manipulation or deception.\n\nRansomware continues to evolve, becoming more targeted and damaging. Expect to see a surge in the prevalence of ransomware that exploits newfound vulnerabilities in software and hardware.\n\nAdditionally, phishing attacks are growing in sophistication, with tactics like Phishing 3.0 leveraging legitimate services to bypass security measures. Your staff must be regularly trained and updated on the latest developments in the field to be able to effectively recognize and respond to these types of social engineering attacks in a timely fashion.\n\nIntegrating IoT devices into business operations expands the attack surface, offering a multitude of new entry points for cybercriminals. Securing your IoT ecosystem by implementing stringent security policies and regular vulnerability assessments will become a top priority in 2024.\n\nConcurrently, the ascent of Web 3.0 introduces new cybersecurity dimensions -- to brace for the impact of this new paradigm, you have to understand the inherent risks of decentralized networks, not just the potential security benefits of decentralization, as well as the importance of robust cryptographic controls to safeguard digital assets.\n\nThe cybersecurity arms race has always been a mad dash where the two parties -- the attacks and the defenders, have been trying to one-up each other. The coming year will be no different, but to stay one step ahead, your business needs to implement the newest best practices as soon as possible\n\nNow, let's take a look at a couple of promising cybersecurity methods and approaches that will allow you to enjoy continued resilience against bad-faith actors in 2024.\n\nZero Trust Architecture (ZTA) isn't just a security trend - it's a necessary shift in how you protect your network. Unlike traditional perimeter security models that trust insiders by default, Zero Trust requires verification from everyone -- inside or outside your network -- before granting access.\n\nIt operates on the principle \"never trust, always verify,\" ensuring that only authenticated users with the necessary permissions can access your data and applications. You'll need to adopt identity and access management paired with least privilege access to effectively apply this model to your security strategy.\n\nThe migration to cloud services offers a myriad of benefits for businesses, so much so that refusing to move to the cloud puts a company at an instant disadvantage in terms of operational efficiency. However, this trend has also unveiled new vulnerabilities, making advanced security approaches such as cloud-based captive portal authentication vital for protecting your assets.\n\nOn top of that, you should look to implement solutions that offer end-to-end encryption and real-time threat detection to safeguard your cloud environment. This applies whether or not your business is digitally focused -- with the data-rich environment of today, even family-owned brick-and-mortar stores and home improvement contractors should focus on cloud data security by leveraging CRM solutions, thereby outsourcing the security and backing up of important customer data.\n\nBy leveraging these technologies, you can maintain visibility and control over your data, regardless of where it resides, thus ensuring cyber resilience. Providers who offer comprehensive security posture assessments should be a part of your adoption strategy to evaluate and fortify your cloud infrastructure -- no matter what industry or sector your business may be in.\n\nWith cyberattacks growing in complexity, Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) are becoming integral parts of a modern security strategy. These technologies can analyze vast amounts of data to identify potential threats more efficiently than traditional methods.\n\nYour defence systems can be trained to detect anomalies and automatically respond to incidents, potentially stopping attacks in real-time. By integrating AI and ML, you're enhancing your defensive technologies with smart solutions that learn and adapt to new security threats as they arise.\n\nBy deploying these strategies, you're not only strengthening your defence but also building resilience into the core of your business.\n\nCybersecurity might be the talk of the town -- but focusing solely on the digital plane leaves businesses exposed in a much more mundane way. Physical security is and always will be both a necessity and a priority -- thankfully, companies can utilize some very interesting and effective new tools in 2024 to mitigate risks.\n\nYour security system's efficacy increases with decentralized solutions. This approach involves a network of surveillance cameras that operate independently, ensuring continuous monitoring even if one camera faces disruption. Leveraging cloud-based technologies, surveillance data can be accessed remotely, allowing you to respond swiftly to any security breach.\n\nAutomatically detecting and alerting security personnel to any suspicious activity in real-time is necessary, and integrating stealth security systems that include motion detectors can cover blind spots, while advanced surveillance cameras can offer real-time monitoring capabilities.\n\nAccess control systems have evolved, and by 2024, biometric technologies such as fingerprint and facial recognition will become even more commonplace.\n\nThese systems offer more than just restricted entry - they provide a comprehensive view of access monitoring, recording each instance an individual enters or exits, enhancing accountability and security within your premises.\n\nThe human element in cybersecurity plays a crucial role -- as it's often the weakest link in security chains. Strengthening this factor involves enhancing employee training and addressing skill shortages.\n\nYou can mitigate risks like social engineering by prioritizing cybersecurity awareness. Implementing continuous employee training programs that are engaging and practical is essential. This ensures that your staff can recognize and respond to cyber threats effectively.\n\nFor example, mock phishing exercises can prepare employees to identify suspicious emails, reducing the risk of breaches. Initiatives like these can prove to be a solid defence against the multitude of digital threats targeting human vulnerabilities.\n\nDealing with talent shortages in cybersecurity means focusing on skill development within your organization. Encouraging employees to develop technical and soft skills can help bridge the gap.\n\nStructured training programs can equip your team with the latest cybersecurity strategies, fostering a proactive security posture. Also, consider investing in courses and certifications that enhance your employees' ability to anticipate and counteract cyber threats. By developing in-house talent, you can lessen the impact of the industry-wide skills shortage and create a resilient security culture.\n\nAs you secure your business premises, understanding and adhering to evolving regulatory compliance and data privacy standards is vital. These safeguard business operations, sensitive data, and consumer trust.\n\nGlobal cybersecurity regulations and frameworks play a crucial role in the governance of how businesses protect sensitive information. The National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) offers guidelines that many international regulations echo.\n\nIntegrating NIST's robust standards helps you align with global expectations, including the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR) and California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA), ensuring that your cybersecurity measures are comprehensive and current.\n\nYour approach to handling sensitive data must include stringent data privacy practices. The Federal Trade Commission (FTC) mandates that businesses protect consumer information. Thus, developing a solid data privacy plan, including third-party risk management, is crucial to compliance and safeguarding your reputation.\n\nIt's important to stay informed about the top cybersecurity threats for employee data as this knowledge is paramount for reinforcing your defense mechanisms against sophisticated cyber attacks.\n\nProper governance, guided by international frameworks and regulations, combined with a focused approach to data privacy, positions your business effectively against the backdrop of increasing cybersecurity challenges.\n\nThe landscape of security is ever-evolving with technology at its core. It's paramount to understand how emerging trends can be leveraged to bolster the safety of your business premises.\n\nUnderstanding security trends that affect your business is the first step in preventing potential breaches. It's not just about technology -- a focus on the human element is also critical. Proper training can turn your employees into the first line of defence against security threats.",

        "body": "WORCESTER, Mass. - Worcester Polytechnic Institute recently announced a new master's program where students can earn a degree in artificial intelligence, and the program will focus on how to create a more ethical and equitable future with the technology while setting prospective graduates up for a career.\n\nWhile AI can feel like a relatively new phenomenon because of the rise of programs like ChatGPT, Elke Rundensteiner, founding head of WPI's new program, said research into machines or computers that can mimic our human behavior or perform tasks we'd usually do dates back decades.\n\n\"But we are in a completely new era where AI has been democratized, and you can see it everywhere now in the news,\" Rundensteiner said. \"So, this is the perfect moment to take on AI and to offer this kind of training for our students.\"\n\nRundensteiner said AI is changing the way we live, how we enjoy entertainment, our work lives, and the kind of jobs that are available to graduates. A strong background in AI could land graduates with careers in health care, game development, robotics, engineering and a wide range of other fields.\n\nCurrently, however, the technology's growing power with little regulation has governments wrestling with its ethical implications. Rundensteiner wants WPI graduates to consider their own responsibility in using the technology for good.\n\n\"Unfortunately, we are just at the very beginning, and we actually do not know all the implications yet - policymakers are trying to figure them out,\" Rundensteiner said. \"It is imperative for us that as we train students to use and invent AI techniques, they also understand the harm they could be doing. It is part of the responsibility of the AI machine learning expert.\"\n\nStudents will have the option to earn three separate credentials in the program. They could obtain a master's degree by completing 30 credit hours of work including a thesis or capstone project if they have earned a bachelor's degree in a related field.\n\nStudents could also pursue a bachelor's in another field and their AI degree at an accelerated pace by double-counting certain courses towards both degrees. Lastly, they could obtain a graduate certificate by completing four thematically related graduate courses in AI.\n\nRundensteiner said she is excited about the project-based aspects of the program, which includes the capstone project.\n\n\"Each single student will work in teams with a partner to solve a real world problem,\" Rundensteiner said. \"So, by the time that the students are graduating, they will already be practitioners because they will already have taken all their skills and applied them to this real world problem.\"",

        "title": "Magic: The Gathering Formally Bans the Use of Generative AI in 'Final' Products",
        "body": "An error in judgement earlier this year -- when a D&D artist confirmed they had used generative AI programs to finish several pieces of art included in the sourcebook Glory of the Giants -- saw Wizards of the Coast publicly ban the use of AI tools in the process of creating art for the venerable TTRPG. Now, the publisher is making that clearer for its other wildly successful game in Magic: The Gathering.\n\n\"For 30 years, Magic: The Gathering has been built on the innovation, ingenuity, and hard work of talented people who sculpt a beautiful, creative game. That isn't changing,\" a new statement shared by Wizards of the Coast on Daily MTG begins. \"Our internal guidelines remain the same with regard to artificial intelligence tools: We require artists, writers, and creatives contributing to the Magic TCG to refrain from using AI generative tools to create final Magic products. We work with some of the most talented artists and creatives in the world, and we believe those people are what makes Magic great.\"\n\nThe statement comes after Wizards of the Coast faced backlash this past August, when it was discovered that the D&D sourcebook Bigby Presents: Glory of the Giants contained multiple pieces of art that had utilized generative AI-created assets to \"polish\" elements of the final work. While in that circumstance Wizards chose to continue working with the artist involved in the pieces, the publisher also established a new set of guidelines \"to make clear that artists must refrain from using AI art generation as part of their art creation process for developing D&D art,\" as well as re-publishing an updated version of Glory of the Giants to replace the AI-assisted pieces with newly commissioned work.\n\nThe wording in the D&D statement is distinctly different to that in the one for Magic: The Gathering, which only says that \"final Magic products\" cannot use generative AI tools, rather than any point of the creative process as addressed by the publisher for D&D. io9 has reached out to Wizards of the Coast for clarification on whether or not generative AI can be used at any point in the creation of work for Magic: The Gathering, such as prompted text edited by a human writer, or early drafts of art that are then finalized by hand, and will update this piece if we hear more.\n\nThe Magic statement also comes in the wake of major layoffs at Wizard's parent company Hasbro. Last week the Wall Street Journal reported that Hasbro plans to lay off 1,100 staff over the next six months across its divisions in a series of cost-cutting measures, with many creatives across Wizard's D&D and Magic teams confirming they were part of the layoffs. Just this week, the company faced backlash for opening a position for a Digital Artist at Wizards of the Coast in the wake of the job cuts, which totaled roughly a fifth of the Hasbro's current workforce across all of its divisions.\n\nThe job description specifically highlights that the role includes having to \"refine and modify illustrative artwork for print and digital media through retouching, color correction, adjusting ink density, re-sizing, cropping, generating clipping paths, and hand-brushing spot plate masks,\" as well as \"use... digital retouching wizardry to extend cropped characters and adjust visual elements due to legal and art direction requirements,\" which critics suggested carried the implication that the role would involve iterating on and polishing art created through generative AI. Whether or not this will be the case considering Wizards' now-publicized stance remains to be seen.",

        "title": "Integrating Fuzzy Logic with Neural Networks: A Python Implementation for Advanced Machine Learning...",
        "body": "Fuzzy neural networks represent an innovative blend of fuzzy logic and neural networks, offering a powerful approach to handle complex, non-linear problems that are hard to model with traditional techniques. This essay will delve into the concept, functionality, and applications of fuzzy neural networks, exploring their significance in the realm of artificial intelligence and machine learning.\n\nWhere precision meets intuition: blending the clarity of neural networks with the wisdom of fuzzy logic.\n\nConceptual Foundation\n\nFuzzy neural networks are a synergy of two distinct yet complementary technologies: fuzzy logic and neural networks. Fuzzy logic, introduced by Lotfi Zadeh in the 1960s, extends traditional binary logic to handle the concept of partial truth, where values range between completely true and completely false. This approach is particularly effective in dealing with imprecise, ambiguous, or subjective information. Neural networks, on the other hand, are inspired by the structure and function of the human brain, designed to recognize patterns and learn from empirical data.\n\nIntegration of Fuzzy Logic and Neural Networks\n\nThe integration of fuzzy logic into neural networks brings the advantage of handling uncertain, noisy, or incomplete data, which is a common challenge in real-world scenarios. In a fuzzy neural network, the learning process is guided not only by numerical data but also by fuzzy rules and membership functions, which define the degree to which an element belongs to a certain set.\n\nLearning and Adaptation\n\nFuzzy neural networks learn in a manner similar to traditional neural networks. They adjust their weights based on the input data and the associated fuzzy rules, improving their performance over time. This learning can be supervised, unsupervised, or reinforced, depending on the application.\n\nArchitecture\n\nThe architecture of a fuzzy neural network typically consists of several layers: an input layer, one or more hidden layers, and an output layer. The input layer receives the raw data, which is then processed through the hidden layers using fuzzy logic operators. The output layer provides the final decision or prediction, often in a fuzzy format that is then defuzzified for practical use.\n\nWide Range of Applications\n\nFuzzy neural networks have been successfully applied in various domains, including control systems, pattern recognition, decision-making, and predictive modeling. For instance, in automotive engineering, they are used for developing advanced driver-assistance systems (ADAS) that require handling uncertain and imprecise information.\n\nAdvantages\n\nOne of the key advantages of fuzzy neural networks is their ability to model complex, nonlinear systems that are difficult to tackle with conventional methods. They are robust to noise and capable of dealing with ambiguity and uncertainty in the data, making them highly versatile and effective in diverse applications.\n\nChallenges\n\nDespite their benefits, fuzzy neural networks face challenges such as determining the optimal number of rules, the risk of overfitting, and the computational complexity associated with training large networks.\n\nFuture Directions\n\nOngoing research is focused on enhancing the efficiency, scalability, and interpretability of fuzzy neural networks. Efforts are also being made to integrate them with other emerging technologies, like deep learning and quantum computing, to further expand their capabilities.\n\nCreating a complete Python implementation of a fuzzy neural network with a synthetic dataset and plots involves several steps. Below, I'll provide a high-level overview and a basic implementation using Python libraries. For simplicity, we'll create a synthetic dataset suitable for a regression task and use a basic fuzzy neural network architecture.\n\nCreating a complete Python implementation of a fuzzy neural network with a synthetic dataset and plots involves several steps.

        "title": "How Creators Can Use AI To Be More Efficient And Still Be Creative",
        "body": "For four weeks in February 2021, Americans streamed 143.2 billion minutes of video content and in February 2022 that number grew to 169.4 billion minutes of video streamed. Americans streamed almost 15 million years' worth of video content in 2021.\n\nBy 2030, the streaming industry is expected to be worth $330 billion. At the same time, the creator economy is expected to double in size -from $250 billion today to $480 billion by 2027.\n\nAs the landscape continues to shift for creators with the onslaught of new technologies like generative artifical intelligence (GAI), creators are finding new challenges in how they are creating.\n\nAccording to Guy Armitage, Founder and CEO of Zealous and author of Everyone is Creative: Seven Easy Steps To UnLock Your Creativity, the AI ecosystem is moving so quickly it is hard for creators to grasp the impact it will have on them.\n\n\"On the one hand, AI will save time on mind-numbingly repetitive tasks - like the dreaded manual rotoscoping -- and speed up early concepts,\" said Armitage. \"Better compression algorithms will speed up the audience's increasing thirst for high-definition experiences and may allow us to become more ecologically friendly in the long term since a staggering 2% of global carbon emissions are from data storage centers.\"\n\n\"On the other hand, AI could steal intellectual property, monetize it, and come for our jobs,\" said Armitage.\n\nGeoffrey Johnston, Product Director at Streamable, said new technologies can help creators stream more efficiently including AI which will save hours in video production, editing and distribution of their content.\n\n\"One of the biggest challenges creators face is the need to come up with fresh and relevant topics constantly,\" said Johnston. \"Creativity of this sort takes time, and lots of it, with we have the capability to identify new and trending topics as they come up and proactively flag upcoming, potentially relevant topics for creators.\"\n\nJohnston says other challenges for creators is editing. \"This may be one of the most boring and tedious parts of the process,\" said Johnston. \"By transcribing the audio, making cuts, pastes, and edits on the corresponding transcript, AI can make video editing feel as efficient as editing a Word document.\"\n\n\"For creators who have already created content in one format, like podcasts, AI helps repurpose and reformat their content for other formats like short form video, which helps expand their reach across multiple platforms and reach more key audiences,\" said Johnston.\n\nJohnston adds that in the end, good creators will use AI to be more creative and bad creators will use AI to push out more generic content. \"The way we're thinking about this is more a question of \"how to use AI to stream content more efficiently without losing your unique voice.\"\n\n\"Preserving the creator's unique voice is AI's greatest challenge,\" he said.\n\nJohnston says that because the creator market is a dynamic market with new technologies emerging rapidly, creators face pressing issues such as platform dependency, intellectual property (IP) and copyright issues, and discovery and visibility.\n\n\"For example, many creators rely on platforms like YouTube, Instagram, TikTok, or Patreon for their livelihoods,\" said Johnston. \"But letting another platform be an intermediary between your audience is risky. Changes in algorithms, policies, or the sudden closure of platforms can significantly impact creators.\"\n\nJohnston says that for example, YouTube has just started cracking down on ad-blockers to force its billions of viewers to be shown ads. \"This has caused quite a reaction among creators, spurred record uninstalls of adblockers, and even caused some to question its ethicality,\" said Johnston.\n\n\"Owning your audience is key - once you start to get traction, it is important, and creators will want to ensure they have control and be more platform independent and focused on connecting with the viewer,\" he said.\n\nRegarding IP and copyright, Johnston says that creators protecting their IP is a growing concern. \"Big content creators have huge legal teams and can take legal action, such as issuing DMCA takedown notices,\" said Johnston. \"Whereas small creators need to protect their intellectual property, but often don't have the resources to do so and are left on their own.\"\n\n\"Five hunderd hours of video are uploaded to YouTube every minute, so with the sheer volume of content being created, getting discovered can be a significant challenge for many creators,\" said Johnston. \"Improving algorithms for content discovery and providing equal opportunities for visibility are ongoing concerns. for creators.\"\n\nData privacy security and regulatory challenges remain some of the most significant issues for creators today. \"Enabling community management and creating sustainable monetization and fair compensation plans also remain key concerns,\" adds Johnston.\n\nArmitage says how the future will pan out depends heavily on critical thinking and regulation. \"Like all technologies, our fate will likely fall within the grey area between Utopians and Dystopians,\" adds Armitage.\n\n\"Current recommendation algorithms have led to an arms race for extreme content which generates engagement, and this has led to creators refusing to join the escalation losing their exposure, audiences viewing increasingly radical media and society becoming angry and polarised,\" said Armitage.\n\n\"However, one thing is sure, just as Smartphones have empowered everyone to take better pictures, AI tools will lower the barrier for those making videos, leading to a flood of new films available online,\" said Armitage. \"Those who have good stories but have lacked the skills and budgets to tell them might finally be able to bring them to life.\"\n\nJohnston echos that good story sentiment. \"More doesn't always mean better and the key is to enable creators to create better content, not just more content,\" said Johnston. \"Better content means higher quality, and when creators produce higher quality content, it benefits consumers by optimizing the impact of time well spent.\"\n\n\"In other words, AI enables augmentation - not just automation. Automation is a big benefit of AI, but only if the quality is there,\" said Johnston.\n\n\"Everyone is creative, and we can have an edge over AI-generated content by developing our unique view of the world,\" said Armitage. \"But we shouldn't shun AI as a tool to support us in bringing ideas to life.\"\n\nArmitage says the exponential generation of content will need us to rethink how we recommend content. \"Artificial intelligence gives us the opportunity to start afresh with balanced micro-customized content,\" he said. \"Giving creators more exposure, audiences better content and (hopefully) creating a more balanced society.\"",

We are excited about the recent successes in our co-location business combined with the growth we have driven in our self-mining business, along with our increased capabilities in our energy management business, as we look to 2024 ahead.\"\n\nDavid Huang, Managing Partner of Krypton Technologies LLC, stated, \"We were impressed with the Mawson facilities and organization, and are looking forward to being a customer of Mawson's co-location business and their platform capabilities. We are looking forward to working with Mawson on a deployment by year-end and potentially extending our relationship further.\"\n\nThe Krypton agreement executed in December further increases Mawson's co-location business in addition to the growth that Mawson's self-mining business has driven in recent months. In October, Mawson signed a customer co-location agreement with a wholly owned subsidiary of Consensus Technology Group LLC (\"Consensus\") for Mawson to provide co-location services for 15,876 miners or approximately 50 MW. The Consensus deployment was completed by Mawson in mid-November, and the Krypton deployment is expected to be completed by the end of December. Mawson anticipates its Midland, Pennsylvania facilities operating at a capacity of 100 MW with the combined potential for self-mining and co-location fleets at its Midland facilities comprising approximately 32,900 miners and 3.6 EH/s. In addition to its facilities at Midland, Mawson has other facilities in Bellefonte, Pennsylvania, which is used entirely for self-mining purposes. As of the end of November 2023, the Bellefonte facility was operating at approximately 8.8 MW of capacity with approximately 2,720 self-miners hashing. With self-mining and the total co-location platforms combined, Mawson's facilities are expected to have a capacity of about 109 MW and about 35,624 miners along with a total hashing capacity of approximately 3.8 EH/s.\n\nAbout Mawson Infrastructure Group\n\nMawson Infrastructure Group (NASDAQ: MIGI) is a digital infrastructure company.

Players obtain these boosters through their physical activities or by purchasing them from other players who follow a distinct gaming strategy and choose to sell their NFT boosters. In essence, daily activities like walking to work or engaging in sports activities such as jogging, swimming, or cardio contribute to SpaceCatch, generating NFT boosters used in the game. It's important to note that NFT boosters cannot be directly bought from SpaceCatch itself; they must be earned through one's own physical activity or acquired from other active players. Once an NFT booster is used, it's burned, generating an ongoing demand for new boosters and ensuring continued player activity. This compels and motivates players to open the app/game during every physical activity and make a contribution to the game via their daily or extra physical activity.",

        "body": "A new blueprint from the global HR research and advisory firm highlights that as artificial intelligence (AI) is predicted to continue making waves in the future of work, organizations that want to remain current must assess their preparedness, identify gaps, and address HR priorities to prepare for AI implementation.\n\nTORONTO, Dec. 19, 2023 /PRNewswire/ - As artificial intelligence (AI) continues to change the way work is done across all industries, organizations that fall behind on implementing policies and trainings to support AI in the workplace are at risk of fallout from shadow AI, according to new research from McLean & Company. The HR research and advisory firm's recent guide, AI Implementation Preparation Guide for HR, has been designed to enable HR teams to proactively prepare for organizational AI implementation.\n\n\"An AI-driven future awaits us, and HR plays a pivotal role in shaping it,\" says Amani Gharib, PhD, director of HR Research & Advisory Services at McLean & Company. \"Employees are using AI, whether organizationally sanctioned or not, so it is imperative to be proactive in preparing the workforce for the integration of AI tools into their workflows.

The firm also reminds HR and organizational leaders that AI effectiveness after implementation relies on clean and consistent data. Enforcing this standard for data is pivotal not only to useful AI outputs and outcomes but for all HR reporting.\n\nFor more information on data governance, please visit Establish Data Governance for HR.\n\nTo access the full guide, please visit AI Implementation Preparation Guide for HR.\n\nIn addition to industry resources, McLean & Company offers workshops to HR professionals to support them in building programs and navigating the nuances of their roles.

        "body": "GAITHERSBURG, Md. -- The U.S. Department of Commerce's National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) has issued a Request for Information (RFI) that will assist in the implementations of its responsibilities under the recent Executive Order on Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence (AI). The order directs NIST to develop guidelines for evaluation, red-teaming and more; facilitate development of consensus-based standards; and provide testing environments for the evaluation of AI systems. These guidelines and infrastructure will be a resource to help the AI community in the safe and trustworthy development and responsible use of AI.\n\n\"President Biden has been clear -- AI is the defining technology of our generation, and we have an obligation to harness the power of AI for good while protecting people from its risks. As part of the president's Executive Order, the Department of Commerce is soliciting feedback across industry, academia, civil society and more so we can develop industry standards around AI safety, security, and trust that will enable America to continue leading the world in the responsible development and use of this rapidly evolving technology,\" said U.S. Secretary of Commerce Gina Raimondo.\n\nThe responses to the request for information will support NIST's efforts to evaluate capabilities relating to AI technologies and develop a variety of guidelines called for in the Executive Order. The RFI specifically calls for information related to AI red-teaming, generative AI risk management, reducing the risk of synthetic content, and advancing responsible global technical standards for AI development.\n\n\"We look forward to strengthening our engagement with the community to advance our understanding of AI measurement and evaluation as we begin to work toward the goals set out in the Executive Order,\" said Under Secretary of Standards and Technology and NIST Director Laurie E. Locascio. \"I want to invite the broader AI community to engage with our talented and dedicated team through this request for information to advance the measurement and practice of AI safety and trust. It is essential that we gather all perspectives as we work to establish a strong and unbiased scientific understanding of AI, which has the potential to impact so many areas of our lives.\"\n\nNIST develops guidance through an open and transparent process that involves a wide range of stakeholders from industry, academia, government and civil society.\n\nOther assignments to NIST in the Executive Order related to cybersecurity and privacy, synthetic nucleic acid sequencing, and supporting agencies' implementation of minimum risk-management practices are being addressed separately from this RFI. Information about NIST's assignments and plans under the Executive Order, along with further opportunities for public input, may be found on the NIST website.\n\nResponses will be accepted until Feb. 2, 2024, and will be posted to www.regulations.gov. The information collected will inform the drafting of guidance that NIST will release for public comment.",

        "title": "TomTom brings AI assistant to cars with Microsft's help",
        "body": "According to Reuters, Dutch digital mapping company TomTom announced an exciting new partnership with tech giant Microsoft on Tuesday to develop an artificial intelligence (AI) powered conversational assistant for vehicles. This assistant utilizes Microsoft's advanced Azure OpenAI service and allows drivers to \"converse naturally with their vehicles,\" interacting through voice with features like infotainment, navigation, and vehicle commands.\n\nAs vehicles become more advanced, automakers have been focused on integrating smart assistant technology into dashboards. Voice-powered assistants like Alexa and Siri have become ubiquitous in our homes and phones, so it's a logical next step to bring similar functionality into our cars to handle tasks while driving. This allows drivers to access useful features while keeping their eyes on the road.\n\nTo create an assistant that can handle natural conversations, vast amounts of data and immense computing power is needed. This is where Microsoft lent its capabilities through Azure OpenAI Service, providing access to the advanced language models created by leading AI research company OpenAI (the maker of ChatGPT). The cutting-edge AI can understand context and hold conversations - perfect for an in-vehicle assistant.\n\nWhile TomTom could have integrated an existing voice assistant like Alexa, it chose instead to custom-build one explicitly optimized for the automotive environment. As a digital mapping pioneer with over 25 years in navigation and location technology, TomTom has the specialized expertise to tailor the AI assistant to handle driving-related requests through voice interactions.\n\nThe conversational assistant can provide quick access to useful in-car features by just using your voice. Ask for directions, queue up your favorite playlist, adjust vehicle settings, and more without ever taking your eyes off the road. This promises a safer and more convenient driving experience. TomTom can integrate the assistant with vehicle infotainment systems across multiple automotive brands.\n\nThis launch builds on an ongoing multi-year partnership between TomTom and Microsoft focused on pushing AI and location technology innovations. TomTom began utilizing Azure cloud tools in 2016 to power its maps and navigation products. With this latest AI assistant, TomTom continues to discover new ways Microsoft's leading AI capabilities can enhance its offerings.",

        "title": "Machine Learning and Random Forest Classification",
        "body": "There has been a lot of hype about generative artificial intelligence (generative AI) and large language models (LLMs). However, there are other types of AI, like machine learning (ML), that are well-suited to powering up your data by using your historical data, stored in Salesforce, Commerce Cloud, Marketing Cloud, or another system, to make predictions.\n\nAs you may already be aware, we are currently working on a low/no-code Model Builder in Einstein Copilot Studio, which will allow you to choose the best AI model for your data and business use case. It's important to understand the types of AI models that exist, so that you can choose the best AI models for your business problem. And this means learning more than just what's available in generative AI and LLMs.\n\nIn this blog post, we'll give you an overview of machine learning, two popular types of ML, and random forest classification, a popular ML model used by data scientists.\n\nMachine learning is a type of artificial intelligence that allows you to make predictions using historical data. Predictive insights from your ML models can help your business to make better decisions and offer better recommendations to your customers. For example, you can use customer data stored in Salesforce, Commerce Cloud, or Data Cloud based on their purchase history to recommend other products that may interest them. You can then use an ML model on that data and make predictions in Einstein Copilot Studio in Data Cloud. In the future, you will be able to use Einstein Copilot Studio's Model Builder to make predictions using limited or no code at all.\n\nYou have likely already encountered machine learning algorithms in your everyday life. For example, if you use Netflix, you might notice that there are sometimes categories that say: \"Because you watched this, we think you may be interested in this.\" Or, after watching a YouTube video, you receive recommendations of other videos and channels that YouTube thinks you may like based on your past watch history.\n\nFully labeled means that each example in the training dataset is tagged with the answer that the algorithm should come up with on its own. For example, a labeled dataset of pictures of colors red, green, and blue, would tell the model which photos had the correct color. When shown a new image, the model compares it to the training examples to predict the correct label (in this example, the correct color).\n\nIn unsupervised learning, an ML model is handed a dataset without explicit instructions on what to do with it. The training dataset instead contains a collection of examples without a specific desired outcome or correct answer. The ML model then attempts to automatically find structure in the data by extracting useful features and analyzing its structure. This is also referred to as clustering.\n\nRandom forest classification is a popular ML model, that uses multiple decision trees to reach a single outcome. Random forest has been widely adopted for solving machine learning problems because of its versatility in handling both classification and regression problems. Random forest classifiers are also effective tools for estimating missing values in data as they maintain accuracy.\n\nImagine that you have a complex problem to solve or a complex question that you need an answer to. You decide to gather a group of experts from different fields to share their opinions on the answer to your question. Each expert provides their individual opinion on the answer based on their expertise and experience. In the end, the experts take a vote to arrive at a final decision.\n\nIn random forest classification, multiple decision trees are created using different random subsets of data and features. Each decision tree acts like an expert, providing its own opinion on how to classify the data. Predictions are then made by calculating the individual prediction for each decision tree and taking the most popular result. Please note: random forest regression problem predictions use an averaging technique instead.\n\nRandom forest classification is used across a wide variety of industries, such as:\n\nRandom forest classification is used in the example scenario in this AWS blog. In the example scenario, demographic data such as gender and state of residence, and behavior data, such as campaign participation and pages visited, are used in a random forest classification ML model to determine products that should be recommended to a customer. Below is an excerpt of the code that was used in the product recommendation ML model in the previously mentioned blog, showing a practical example of how to use random forest classification from sci-kit-learn in your code.\n\nIn this blog, you learned about machine learning and some types of ML models. You also learned about random forest classification, a very popular ML model used by data scientists across a variety of industries that you can even apply to Salesforce industry clouds, such as Financial Services Cloud, Health Cloud, or Commerce Cloud, to make predictions for a variety of different problems. You now have a better understanding of what machine learning is and how you can use it with the power of the Einstein 1 Platform. Now it's time to take your learning even further and start working with some ML models on your own and integrating them with Einstein Copilot Studio!\n\nTrailhead: Artificial Intelligence Fundamentals\n\nTrailhead: Data Fundamentals for AI\n\nTrailhead: Machine Learning Predictions: Quick Look",

        "title": "Bill Gates' predictions for 2024: fewer undernourished kids, more AI",
        "body": "SEATTLE -- Issuing his annual predictions for the year to come on Tuesday, Bill Gates said 2024 will be a \"turning point.\"\n\nGates, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft, said in the 10-page letter that he expects to see more innovations in artificial intelligence, a breakthrough in infant malnutrition, advances in climate change talks and defining elections around the world.\n\nAhead of 2023, Gates projected the world could recover lost ground on polio eradication, AI-powered ultrasounds could help save mothers and their babies, gene therapy could help treat AIDS and better buildings would combat climate change.\n\nWith a $118.5 billion net worth, according to Forbes, Gates is the seventh-richest person on the planet. As former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos settles in Miami, a move he announced last month, Gates will become the richest person in Washington state.\n\nGates and ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, have donated billions of dollars to a variety of causes through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Last year, he announced he would give away virtually his entire fortune through the foundation. \"I will move down and eventually off of the list of the world's richest people,\" he said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nArtificial intelligence\n\nGates' forecast on AI goes beyond last year's ultrasound prediction, asserting that AI progress will broadly improve global health while enabling innovation in developed and developing countries.\n\n\"Artificial intelligence is about to accelerate the rate of new discoveries at a pace we've never seen before,\" Gates wrote.\n\nAI could help communities around the world with combating antibiotic resistant diseases, helping non-English speakers manage high-risk pregnancies and making medical information easier to access for health workers.\n\nStill, he said, \"there is a long road ahead for projects like these.\" Hurdles include scaling the technology without sacrificing quality and ensuring functionality over time.\n\n\"If we make smart investments now, AI can make the world a more equitable place,\" Gates wrote.\n\nWhile no longer CEO, Gates remains an adviser at Microsoft. This year, the tech giant moved aggressively to incorporate generative AI into its products, including the search engine Bing and browser Edge through a partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.\n\nGates predicts the general population in high-income countries is between 18 to 24 months away from wide AI use. Elsewhere, Gates expects that number to be three years.\n\nGlobal health advancements\n\nThe world is near a breakthrough in using gut microbiome supplements to address malnutrition in children, according to Gates.\n\n\"Feeding infants this probiotic helps them move their microbiome into that positive state so they can grow up and achieve their full potential,\" Gates wrote. \"The next step is (hopefully) broader regulatory approval and scaled-up, high quality, and reliable manufacturing.\"\n\nNutritionists can also look toward developing a probiotic supplement for mothers while the child is still in the womb, he continued.\n\nNuclear energy\n\nAccording to Gates, climate change conversations are advancing as more people experience extreme weather.\n\nA lot of the climate change discussions surround clean energy, which increasingly includes nuclear power, said Gates, a longtime backer of nuclear energy.\n\n\"In 2024 and beyond, I predict we will see lots of new innovations coming into the marketplace -- even in very complicated areas like nuclear,\" Gates wrote.\n\nThat is good news for TerraPower, the nuclear energy company he founded in 2008. TerraPower's first plant in Wyoming, which will potentially open in 2030, \"will be the most advanced nuclear facility in the world,\" he said.\n\nAt the COP28 climate change conference in Dubai this year, which Gates attended, he said he was optimistic about the future, based on the rising number of climate technology startups present there compared to eight years ago at the Paris conference.\n\nOverall, Gates wrote, he is optimistic. This decade will be key for upgrading electric grids and improving power transmission to realize the full potential of clean energy, he said. But he added the world still needs to figure out how to get to zero emissions.\n\nElections around the globe\n\nIn 2024, countries that house more than half of the world's population will hold elections, Gates said. Those countries include the United States, India, Indonesia and South Africa.\n\nThe results of the elections will \"shape the future of global health and the climate,\" according to Gates.\n\n\"If I could make one wish for all the people headed to the polls next year -- no matter where they live -- it would be for them to consider elected leaders who understand the importance of investing in human development around the world,\" Gates wrote.\n\nGates listed the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief launched in 2003 by then-President George W. Bush as one of the models of a program that governments should support.\n\nNowadays, climate change is a challenge that needs global attention and support, he added. He also warned the world is not ready for another pandemic similar to COVID-19.\n\n\"I believe the 2024 elections will be a turning point for both health and climate,\" Gates wrote.\n\n(Microsoft Philanthropies and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation underwrite some Seattle Times journalism projects.)\n\n©2023 The Seattle Times.

They have transformed levels within games into assets that players can capture and own. This ownership allows players to earn all the income generated by that level indefinitely until another player captures it from them. This innovative revenue-sharing model is a world first. It signifies a paradigm shift in Web3, emphasizing real economic scalability and sustainability.\n\nOn a quest to revolutionize a trillion-dollar industry, Verasity is globally recognized for bringing trust and transparency to the advertising sector.

By harnessing the power of Web3, LAKE is slowly turning this vision into reality.

Founded by Australian entrepreneur Sergei Sergienko, the platform quickly became the leader in the freelance market and is currently used by over 100,000 freelancers and 2,000 employers.\n\nThe product's innovation lies in the use of digital contracts, which fully automate recruitment and working relationships. Digital escrow allows locking funds once the contract is signed and releasing them upon the work acceptance. Next year, Chrono.tech -- the company behind LaborX -- plans to introduce cryptocurrency payments for full-time employees with automatic hourly, daily, weekly, or monthly compensations.\n\nFreename seeks to transform the way the next generation interacts with the internet since it is one of the rapidly expanding start-ups in the web3 industry.

        "title": "Microsoft: Cloud Leadership Soars (NASDAQ:MSFT)",
        "body": "Strategic partnerships with Oracle, OpenAI, and Salesforce, coupled with the development of custom Arm-based chips, position Microsoft Corporation favorably in the expanding cloud market.\n\nIn our previous analysis, we believed Microsoft Corporation (NASDAQ:MSFT) could benefit from its exclusive partnership with OpenAI as OpenAI's sole cloud provider and stand to gain significant advantages by powering OpenAI's workloads through Azure and integrating the advanced GPT-4 model into its extensive range of products and services. We believed that Microsoft's leadership in Enterprise Software, Application Development Software, and Productivity Software, comprising 77.2% of the market, is attributable to its diverse artificial intelligence (\"AI\") solutions and integration with OpenAI's superior GPT-4, setting it apart from competitors like IBM (IBM). Microsoft's seamless integration of AI-powered solutions throughout its product ecosystem further contributes to its strength. Additionally, we saw Microsoft as a frontrunner in the cloud market for AI, particularly in NLP and Computer Vision, and believed that incorporating GPT-4 into Azure OpenAI Service strengthens its position against competitors such as Amazon's (AMZN) AWS and Google Cloud (GOOG).\n\nFollowing the company's recent fiscal Q1 earnings, we return to cover the company again as Azure cloud revenue growth had bounced back to 29% YoY from the previous quarter after slowing down in FY2023. Thus, we examine whether the company's cloud growth could continue to accelerate further by analyzing the cloud market which had been faced with slowing growth overall throughout the year. Moreover, we also examine Microsoft's partnerships and collaborations to determine how it could impact its cloud business as well as determine whether Microsoft is starting to capitalize on its advantages in AI for cloud.\n\nFirstly, we examined the cloud infrastructure market growth in 2023 by compiling the market growth from Q1 to Q3 2023.\n\nAs seen above, the cloud infrastructure market growth had slowed down in Q3 YTD 2023 with a YoY growth rate of only 19.2%, the lowest for the market in the past 12 years and below our forecast of recovery of the market growth to 33.1% for the full year of 2023. In 2022, although data volume growth decreased slightly, the slowdown of the cloud market was to a larger extent, leading to the Cloud Infrastructure Revenue Growth/Data Volume Growth (\"CRDV\") factor decreasing to 0.95x. Moreover, based on the average 10-year data volume growth as our forecast growth for 2023 (30.4%), we calculated the CRDV factor would decline to 0.63x in 2023 compared to our forecast of 1.09x. In the past 5 years, the highest and lowest data volume growth rate was 56.8% and 24.2% respectively, which would translate to a CRDV factor of 0.34x and 0.79x respectively. Therefore, even in the hypothetical scenario where the data volume growth is the lowest (24.2%), the highest CRDV factor would still be 0.79x, which is lower than in 2022 (0.95x), therefore, we believe the decline of the CRDV factor is the main component that could explain the market slowdown.\n\nWe compiled several factors highlighted by the top cloud companies (AWS, Azure and Google Cloud) affecting their growth in 2023.\n\nBased on the past 3 earnings briefings of the companies, all of them highlighted cloud optimization which continued in Q3 2023, though AWS claimed optimization had slowed down. Cloud optimization involves accurately choosing and allocating resources to a workload or application, ensuring alignment with performance needs and cost-effectiveness. According to AWS and Google, customers optimized their cloud amid macroeconomic uncertainty.\n\nMicrosoft describes the cycle of cloud workloads where new cloud workloads start and get optimized.\n\nThe second thing, of course, is the workloads start, then workloads get optimized, and then new workloads start, and that cycle continues. - Satya Nadella, Chairman & CEO.\n\nMicrosoft further guided that it expects optimization in the cloud to continue in Q2 as well as H2 of FY2024. However, it highlighted the impact of optimization was higher in previous quarters. In the previous earnings briefing, Microsoft also highlighted that during the pandemic, there were \"lots of new project starts\" and its customers postponed optimization until recently as \"catch-up optimization\" which the company expects \"will come down.\"\n\nWe've been very consistent that the optimization trends have been consistent for us through a couple of quarters now. Customers are going to continue to do that. It's an important part of running workloads that is not new. There obviously were some quarters where it was more accelerated, but that is a pattern that is and has been a fundamental part of having customers, both make new room for new workload adoption and continue to build new capabilities. - Amy Hood, EVP & CFO, FQ1 earnings call.\n\nTherefore, we believe that cloud optimization highlights increasing cloud efficiency which we previously determined as a factor for the slowdown of the cloud market in 2022. While companies such as Microsoft expect high levels of cloud optimization to come down, it highlighted it will continue to provide customers with cloud optimization capabilities going forward, thus we believe this could be a negative factor for the CRDV factor.\n\nFurthermore, according to Amazon and Google, another factor highlighted for the cloud market weakness was tough macroeconomic conditions. However, in our previous analysis of Taiwan Semiconductor (TSM), we highlighted the improving outlook of the global economy in 2023 with a higher average revised forecast of 2.55% versus 1.9% based on IMF, PwC, EY and World Bank revised global GDP projections. Therefore, we do not believe macroeconomic conditions to be the main reason for the CRDV factor decline.\n\nIn terms of enterprise IT spending, Gartner forecasts a growth rate of 3.5% for total IT spending this year, higher than 2.9% in 2022. Moreover, IT services growth is forecasted to be fairly in line in 2023 at 7.3% with last year's growth rate of 7.5%. Therefore, we believe IT spending is not a factor in the slowdown in cloud market growth. Additionally, based on the OECD, the ICT capital component of growth in GDP in 2022 was 0.5% and had been very stable in the past 10 years at an average of 0.4%.\n\nIn terms of cloud pricing, we believe this is not a factor for its slowing growth as the top cloud players such as Microsoft (11%) and Google Cloud (25%) had raised their cloud services pricing in 2023. Furthermore, AWS pricing for spot instances has increased by 21% in 2023. According to Liftr, Azure pricing had declined in 2022 by 9.1% but Amazon's cloud prices increased by an average of 23% in the past 3 years with each increase higher each year since 2019. Moreover, Google Cloud previously increased pricing for some of its cloud services by between 50% to 100% in 2022. Therefore, all of the top 3 cloud providers' pricing increases in 2023 are lower compared to the previous year which could indicate it as a factor for the slowdown in the CRDV factor.\n\nThe chart above shows the CRDV factor in a decreasing trend, which we believe is due to cloud optimization.\n\nOverall, we believe the cloud market slowdown in 2023 with the decline in the CRDV factor even in the bull case (0.79x) could be attributed to factors such as cloud optimization and slowing price increase by top cloud providers in 2023. According to the top cloud providers, these cloud optimizations have affected their cloud growth as a headwind but indicated that although cloud optimization will remain as part of the cloud cycle, cloud optimization could moderate is expected to moderate going forward by the top cloud providers as customers delayed optimization during the pandemic period according to Microsoft. Moreover, we find pricing increases that were announced by the top cloud providers to be lower than in 2022, which could further contribute to the slowdown.\n\nAll in all, we see 2023's CRDV factor declining significantly to 0.63x based on the 10-year data volume growth average which we continue to use as our assumption through 2027 and CRDV factor in 2024 based on a 3-year average of 0.81x, an increase compared to 2023 as we expect the market to improve as cloud optimization moderates, but tapering down by a 5-year average of 6.4% per year. In total, we forecasted the cloud market growth 5-year average of 23%, which is lower compared to our previous forecast of 38.1% due to the lower Revenue Growth/Data Volume Growth factor (1.25x previously) as we expect cloud optimization to continue impacting cloud market growth.\n\nRecently, Microsoft announced several cloud partnerships it had secured with partners such as Oracle and Salesforce. We examined Microsoft's cloud partnerships by compiling a value chain of its partners in the chart below.\n\nAt the start of the value chain, the first group of partners to Microsoft's cloud are semiconductor companies such as server GPU makers Nvidia (NVDA) and AMD (AMD), CPU makers Intel (INTC) and AMD, memory chipmaker Micron (MU) as well as foundries such as TSMC and GlobalFoundries (GFS). Chips in the cloud are vital for processing data, facilitating virtualization, supporting efficient networking, and providing security features, collectively enhancing the performance and capabilities of cloud computing services. These chips are incorporated in cloud infrastructure equipment such as servers which include server makers Dell (DELL), HPE (HPE) and Lenovo (OTCPK:LNNGY). Servers act as the backbone of computing infrastructure, hosting and executing applications, storing data, and facilitating communication between different components. Both semiconductor and server maker partners are suppliers to Microsoft and represent a significant share of capex spending by Microsoft cloud.\n\nMicrosoft Azure has several IT consulting company partners such as Accenture, Capgemini (OTCPK:CAPMF) and Infosys (INFY). IT consulting companies assist organizations with the strategic adoption and migration of cloud computing technologies from developing comprehensive cloud strategies and managing migrations to ensuring security and providing ongoing support. Thus, these firms are sales partners to Microsoft, helping it promote the adoption of its cloud services to its customers.\n\nFinally, the value chain concludes with Microsoft serving enterprise customers, offering scalable infrastructure, development tools, and advanced services, enabling efficient application development, global accessibility without the need for extensive physical infrastructure investment. For example, it includes Financial companies like Moody's (MCO) and UBS (UBS) enabling the modernization of financial operation platforms. In the Industrials sector, customers like Siemens (OTCPK:SIEGY) and Lockheed Martin (LMT) leverage Azure for the development of industrial AI solutions such as Siemens Industrial Copilot and GEMS technology catering to automotive and military customers respectively enhancing operational efficiency and innovation in industries such as manufacturing and aerospace.\n\nWithin Software, Microsoft has several exclusive partnerships such as with Oracle, Salesforce and OpenAI. We examined how each of these exclusive partnerships benefits Microsoft.\n\nOracle Database Partnership\n\nIn 2023, Microsoft announced that it had secured a partnership with Oracle to be the:\n\n\"only cloud provider other than Oracle Cloud Infrastructure (ORCL) to host Oracle services, including Oracle Exadata Database Service and Oracle Autonomous Database on Oracle Cloud Infrastructure in Azure datacenters.\"\n\nMicrosoft highlighted this will enable Oracle's database customers, including 97% of Fortune 100 companies who use Oracle databases, to migrate to the cloud. Additionally, Oracle stated that its database solution can be purchased by customers on Azure Marketplace, which could provide an opportunity for them to capture Azure customers.\n\nWe believe this partnership benefits Microsoft as Oracle is one the leading database management software companies, at 3 place according to Gartner, trailing behind Microsoft and AWS. That being said, Oracle has been faced with increasing competition from Microsoft. Based on the chart, Oracle is one of the top DBMS companies but has lost its longstanding market leadership with the rise of cloud-based DBMS providers such as Microsoft, AWS and Google which had been growing faster than the overall DBMS market as highlighted previously.\n\nSpecifically, Oracle database users who choose Azure will be able to access various products offered in Microsoft's cloud.\n\nOracle Database@Azure customers can migrate existing databases to OCI and deploy in Azure, enhance security by keeping apps and data on a single network, gain optimal performance with the same fully managed Exadata Database Service that runs in OCI, and then innovate with the comprehensive services offered in the Microsoft cloud. - Microsoft.\n\nTherefore, we believe this would enable Microsoft to capitalize on Oracle's database customers' cloud migration and enable cross-selling revenue opportunities by providing customers with access to Microsoft's cloud solutions.\n\nOnce we announced that the Oracle databases are going to be available on Azure, we saw a bunch of unlock from new customers who have significant Oracle estates that have not yet moved to the cloud because they needed to rendezvous with the rest of the app estate in one single cloud. And so we're excited about that. So in some sense, even the financial services sector, for example, is a good place where there's a lot of Oracle that still needs to move to the cloud. - Satya Nadella, Chairman & CEO.\n\nOracle OCI\n\nBesides that, Microsoft also recently signed an agreement with Oracle Cloud to collaborate on using Oracle OCI for its Bing AI service amid a shortage of Nvidia's server GPUs. Oracle Cloud features thousands of top-range Nvidia H100 and A100 GPUs. Therefore, we believe this partnership would allow Microsoft to utilize Oracle for services such as Bing AI which does not monetize and utilize capacity saved in its data centers to cater to AI cloud service customers such as its Azure OpenAI. However, Oracle is only a small player in the cloud market with a 2% market share in 2022. Furthermore, Microsoft Azure also utilized Nvidia's H100 chips with the next-gen H200 planned to be used by Azure next year according to Nvidia.\n\nOpenAI\n\nFurthermore, as highlighted previously, Microsoft has a partnership with OpenAI where it is the exclusive cloud provider to the company, powering OpenAI's workloads \"across research, products and API services\". In addition, Microsoft promised to increase its investments in \"the development and deployment of specialized supercomputing systems to accelerate OpenAI's groundbreaking independent AI research\" as well as build out Azure infrastructure to integrate and deploy OpenAI's AI applications globally. For example, this includes its Azure OpenAI Service which allows customers to build AI applications supported by OpenAI's models. This follows after the company announced its multiyear partnership with OpenAI with plans to further increase its investments in the company. Overall, we believe this partnership could benefit Microsoft's cloud growth as OpenAI not only has the top LLM with GPT-4 based on parameters as analyzed previously, but also magnificent growth. According to SimilarWeb, OpenAI's ChatGPT web visits reached 1.5 bln in September 2023, a 143% growth rate since January 2023.\n\nSalesforce\n\nFurthermore, within the CRM market, Microsoft's partnership with Salesforce (CRM) began as its public cloud provider for Salesforce Marketing Cloud as well as enabling various integrations between Salesforce's CRM platform and Microsoft's products such as Teams. As covered previously, Salesforce has an agnostic AI model approach for its AI CRM solutions. This means that its customers could choose other AI models besides their own such as OpenAI, which benefits Microsoft as its sole cloud provider. However, that said, Salesforce's approach also allows competitors to integrate with its solutions such as Amazon Sagemaker and Google Vertex AI. Overall, we believe Salesforce's partnership with Microsoft could benefit its growth as Salesforce has been consistently the CRM market leader with a 23% market share and we previously forecasted a strong growth outlook supported by AI CRM with a 5-year forward average growth of 18%.\n\nMicrosoft In-House Arm-based Chips\n\nMoreover, Microsoft had announced new custom Arm-based chips to be featured in its data centers including its Colbalt 100 CPU and Maia 100 GPU, launching next year in 2024. This comes amid a supply shortage of Nvidia's top-range server GPUs including A100 and H100.\n\nDemand for Nvidia's A100 and H100 chips has far outstripped supply over the past year, with even Microsoft tapping rival cloud providers such as Oracle for extra GPU capacity to support its own AI services. In another sign of computing capacity constraints in AI, OpenAI -- which is backed by Microsoft and relies heavily on its infrastructure -- was forced on Tuesday to \"pause\" new sign-ups to its ChatGPT Plus service after a \"surge in usage\". - Financial Times.\n\nTherefore, we believe Microsoft's move towards custom chip development could benefit the company to scale its cloud infrastructure and support its rapid cloud growth and not be constrained as it had been such as with OpenAI's premium ChatGPT.\n\nBesides that, according to Microsoft, its custom chip development could enable it to benefit customers in terms of speed, cost and quality. Generally, Arm-based processors are recognized for fast instruction execution, promoting efficient performance and high energy efficiency.\n\nWe think this gives us a way that we can provide better solutions to our customers that are faster and lower cost and higher quality. - Scott Guthrie, executive vice president of Microsoft's cloud and AI group.\n\nMoreover, Microsoft's custom chip developments come after its top competitors Microsoft and Google had been in custom Arm-based server chip development. For example, Amazon launched its latest Trainium server GPU in 2021 following the release of its first-gen Inferentia GPU in 2019. In CPUs, Amazon first launched its Graviton processors in 2018. Whereas Google (GOOG) developed its custom chip called a TPU designed for AI inferencing and training.\n\nWe compared the company's GPU in the table below with Nvidia's H100, Amazon Trainium and Google's TPU v4 to determine whether it has any performance advantage against these companies.\n\nSource: Microsoft, Nvidia, Amazon, ArXiv, Khaveen Investments.\n\nAs seen in the table, Microsoft's Maia 100 GPU will be built using a TSMC 5nm process, trailing behind Nvidia which uses a 4nm process but is more advanced than Amazon's Trainium and Google's TPU. Despite that, Microsoft's GPU has the highest transistor count at 105 bln compared to Nvidia, Amazon and Google. Though, Microsoft's GPU has lower memory capacity and bandwidth compared to Nvidia but higher than Amazon and Google. Overall, this could indicate Microsoft GPU edges out Amazon and Google but is unlikely to outperform Nvidia's H100. Moreover, Nvidia's next-gen H200 chip is planned to be released in 2024 and could be even stronger than Microsoft's.\n\nFurthermore, in terms of CPU, Microsoft has not provided many details about its Colbalt 100 CPU but stated that it is a 64-bit 128-core chip. For comparison, AMD's 4 gen EPYC server CPUs also include up to 128 cores while Intel's Xeon CPUs have up to 56 cores.\n\nThe 64-bit 128-core chip represents performance improvements of up to 40% over current generations of Azure Arm servers. - Microsoft.\n\nBesides performance, in terms of costs, while Microsoft had not indicated how much customers could save with its custom chips, management indicated that the use of its own custom silicon could enable it to provide cheaper cloud models for customers using its chips.\n\nAzure's end-to-end AI architecture, now optimized down to the silicon with Maia, paves the way for training more capable models and making those models cheaper for our customers. - Scott Guthrie, executive vice president of Microsoft's cloud and AI group.\n\nAccording to Amazon, the company claims that migrating to cloud instances based on Amazon Graviton2 processors provides up to 20% cost savings to customers. Thus, we believe the company's move towards custom Arm-based CPUs could allow it to pass on cost savings to customers to increase its competitiveness in the cloud market. Notwithstanding, Microsoft's management will continue to obtain chips from Nvidia to diversify and provide choices to customers.\n\nAt the scale we operate, it's important to optimize and integrate every layer of the stack to maximize performance, but it's also important to diversify and give our customers choices. - Rani Borkar, corporate vice-president for Azure Hardware Systems and Infrastructure\n\nOutlook\n\nOverall, Microsoft has partnerships with various companies including semiconductors, server makers and IT consulting firms in cloud. Microsoft has several key partnerships which we believe could support the competitiveness of its cloud business. This includes its partnership with Oracle for integrating its database services with Microsoft Azure, allowing the company to capitalize on Oracle's customers' migration to the cloud as the only cloud partner to Oracle. Besides that, Microsoft has signed an agreement with Oracle to utilize its data center capacity equipped with high-end Nvidia GPUs for some of Microsoft's AI services such as Bing AI, which could allow it to use its capacity to cater to other AI cloud services. Moreover, we believe Microsoft's partnership with OpenAI and Salesforce (CRM market leader) as their exclusive cloud provider for OpenAI's AI workloads and Salesforce Marketing Cloud CRM platforms.\n\nSource: Company Data, Khaveen Investments.\n\nFurthermore, we expect Microsoft's custom development of Arm-based CPUs and GPUs to be significant to Microsoft, allowing it to compete with other competitors such as AWS and Google Cloud which already have custom Arm chips in their data centers with benefits such as cost-effectiveness. For example, based on the table above of our updated compilation of cloud pricing, Microsoft has the highest pricing among competitors. Assuming it achieves a 20% saving with its custom Arm-based chips and passes the cost savings to customers, similar to Amazon, its cloud pricing would be lower than AWS, Google and Alibaba, increasing its competitiveness in the cloud market.\n\nWe examined Microsoft's cloud growth compared to its competitors and determined whether it is already realizing its advantage which we believed it has due to its wide breadth of AI solutions and integration with OpenAI's GPT-4 models.\n\nIn Q3 2023, Microsoft's Azure revenue growth had improved (29% YoY) following its slowing growth. According to Microsoft, in its latest earnings briefing, \"higher-than-expected AI consumption contributed to revenue growth in Azure.\"\n\nSource: Synergy Research, Company Data, Khaveen Investments.\n\nWe compiled the market share and revenue performance of the top cloud providers in Q3 YTD 2023 above. As seen, Microsoft's cloud growth was the highest at 27.6% followed by Google and Amazon.\n\nIn our previous analysis, we found Microsoft has the most AI cloud solutions which is reflected by it having the highest growth rate. However, Google has a higher growth rate than Amazon despite having fewer AI-related cloud solutions.\n\nSource: Company Data, Khaveen Investments.\n\nWe updated our comparison of the top cloud providers from our previous analysis of pricing (based on 2 core CPUs and 8GB of RAM), total availability zones and number of cloud services. Compared to our previous analysis, the average cloud pricing had decreased by 10% which we believe could be due to the impact of cloud optimization. In terms of availability zones, Google continues to lead with the highest followed closely by Microsoft. Additionally, Google has overtaken Microsoft with more cloud products with AWS trailing behind.\n\nSource: Company Data, Khaveen Investments.\n\nBased on our updated comparison, we ranked each company by each metric and derived their average ranking and factor score. As seen Google Cloud ranked the highest is ahead of Microsoft, which is placed second, due to its stronger positions across all metrics.\n\nOutlook\n\nNotwithstanding, despite its leading ranking in our analysis, in Q3 2023 YTD, Microsoft had outperformed Google Cloud with a higher growth rate, indicating other factors that we had not accounted for. One of the factors could be due to AI where we determined that Microsoft leads all cloud competitors in terms of number of AI-related cloud services.\n\nSource: Company Data, Khaveen Investments.\n\nComparing the number of total cloud AI solution rankings with their Q3 2023 YTD growth, Microsoft had outperformed all competitors except for Oracle which growth had surged in 2023 following the partnership with Microsoft for its Bing AI on Oracle Cloud.\n\nSource: Company Data, Khaveen Investments.\n\nThus, we factored in the number of AI cloud services in our cloud revenue projections for each company. We included the ranking of cloud AI solutions and derived a new average and factor score. However, our model continues to show Microsoft having the second-highest factor score as we weighed each metric equally. Based on our updated factor scores, we forecast each company's growth rate by multiplying each of their factor scores with our cloud market projections and deriving our cloud market share projections as seen below. Overall, we expect Microsoft's market share to continue rising and challenging market leader AWS. Additionally, we see Google's share rising rapidly as well but remaining below Microsoft in third place as its market share is much smaller (0.53x) than Microsoft.\n\nDespite Microsoft's current lead in cloud for AI based on its number of services related to AI, we believe one of the risks to the company is competition from top competitors who are also aggressively expanding in space. Notably, market leader AWS is investing $4 bln in OpenAI's competitor, Anthropic and will depend on AWS as its primary cloud provider as well as pursue joint development of AI models for AWS customers. Furthermore, Amazon is reportedly building an LLM called \"Olympus\" which supports 2 tln parameters, making it more advanced than OpenAI's GPT-4 model. Besides Amazon, Google is also developing a next-gen AI model named \"Gemini\" which could launch in 2024 and challenge OpenAI. Therefore, we believe these developments by Microsoft's competitors could threaten its position as the top cloud AI company and affect its growth outlook in the cloud.\n\nSource: Company Data, Khaveen Investments.\n\nWe updated our revenue projections for Microsoft by segments from our previous analysis with its full-year FY2023 results, we also updated our projections for its cloud revenue growth with a forward average of 28.5% under its Server Products segment. In total, we forecasted Microsoft's forward 3-year average of 17.2%, including our previous estimate of Activision's revenue contribution following the completion of the deal.\n\nBased on a discount rate of 9.3% (company's WACC) and terminal value based on its 5-year average EV/EBITDA of 22.19x, our model shows an upside of 20.3% for the company.\n\nIn summary, the anticipated slowdown in the cloud market for 2023 is attributed to factors like cloud optimization and lower price hikes by major providers. As we foresee the influence of cloud optimization moderating in line with Microsoft's expectations, we have revised our cloud market projections, indicating a 5-year average growth of 23%, driven primarily by the growth in data volume. Regarding Microsoft's cloud growth prospects, we believe its strategic partnerships with Oracle, OpenAI, and Salesforce position it favorably to capitalize on the expanding cloud market. Also, we believe the development of custom Arm-based chips to generate cost savings for customers, bolstering Microsoft's competitiveness.\n\nIn our updated analysis comparing top cloud providers, Microsoft stands out as a leading company in terms of data center presence, the breadth of cloud services, and AI-related offerings. We believe this positions Microsoft to continue gaining market share, with our projected factor score 1.14x higher than our market growth projections, resulting in a forward average growth of 28.5%, supporting overall company growth.\n\nHowever, based on our revised discounted cash flow analysis, we have established a lower price target of $448.14. This adjustment is driven by a reduced total forward growth of 15.9%, compared to the previous 19.2%, reflecting the impact of lower cloud market growth projections factoring in cloud optimization. All in all, we rate Microsoft Corporation stock as a Buy.",

        "title": "Evaxion Announces Business Update and Third Quarter 2023 Financial Results - Evaxion Biotech (NASDAQ:EVAX)",
        "body": "COPENHAGEN, Denmark, Dec. 19, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Evaxion Biotech A/S EVAX (\"Evaxion\" or the \"Company\"), a clinical-stage TechBio company specializing in developing AI-Immunology™ powered vaccines, today provided a business update and announced its third quarter 2023 financial results.\n\nChristian Kanstrup, Evaxion's CEO, reports, \"It has been a great pleasure to join Evaxion, and the first three months have confirmed my belief in a world-class organization and business with strong potential for addressing significant unmet needs within cancer and infectious diseases. Our AI-Immunology™ platform offers unique opportunities in this connection. A key focus for the first months has been to refine the Evaxion strategy with a strong focus on execution and value realization.\n\n\"I am pleased to be able to share the refined strategy in a simple, straightforward overview below. The core of our strategy lies in our pioneering AI-Immunology™ platform, which has been continuously refined and validated over the past many years. This platform holds the potential for generating one new target every 24 hours, is delivery modality agnostic, and is easily adaptable to partner needs. Based on the unique multi-disciplinary capabilities built around our different AI prediction models, we focus on value realization via Targets, Pipeline and Responders. We have already seen substantial progress within each of these three areas: two partnerships announced within Targets and encouraging initial EVX-01 Phase 2 data showcase significant progress in our Pipeline. Within Responders, we have obtained proof-of-principle for our checkpoint inhibitor responder model.\n\n\"The refined strategy also means reduced focus on Evaxion-driven clinical trials, significantly reducing the cash burn. Combined with a stronger focus on value realization based upon our AI-Immunology™ platform, we have the ambition of being able to generate full-year 2024 business development income equal to our cash burn in 2024, excluding financing activities. We believe we are set for strong business execution based on our refined strategy.\"\n\nChristian Kanstrup continued, \"I am also very pleased with the bridge financing round we just priced. It is an important element in our long-term financing strategy. The investor base in the round consists of existing investors, management, and the board of directors, as well as new investors. The largest new investor is MSD Global Health Innovation Fund (MSD GHI), the corporate venture capital arm of Merck & Co., Inc., Rahway, NJ, USA, accounting for some 25% of the private placement. I am looking very much forward to be working with the capable team from MSD GHI. We believe this financing round shows strong confidence in our future business outlook.\n\n\"We are also excited to see that the validation of the AI-Immunology™ platform has continued. The EDEN™ AI prediction model has been validated for B-cell antigen discovery across seven different pathogens and formed a central component of the two important partnerships Evaxion entered into during the third quarter. One of these partnerships brings together AI-discovered antigens and mRNA technology - a first in the Evaxion pipeline. EDEN™ and the T-cell epitope discovery model, RAVEN™, are pivotal components of the other partnership forged with a leading pharmaceutical company to discover and develop vaccines against a pathogen with high unmet medical need for which no vaccines are available. Evaxion plans to build on this momentum and leverage our AI-Immunology™ platform to pursue new partnerships for novel vaccine targets within infectious diseases.\n\n\"This quarter has also seen significant developments in our cancer portfolio and capabilities. A comprehensive clinical update on the EVX-01 Phase 2 trial shared at the SITC conference confirms the encouraging Phase 1 immune profile seen for our lead personalized cancer vaccine asset. This achievement solidifies our confidence in the potential AI-Immunology™ holds at becoming a new treatment paradigm for metastatic melanoma.\n\n\"Another truly exciting element in the AI-Immunology™ platform is the ObsERV™ model, which is unique to Evaxion and allows us to harness a new source of tumor-specific antigens in oncology patients. With ObsERV™, we hope to expand the therapeutic reach of personalized cancer vaccines to patients with high mutational burden tumors but low numbers of high-quality neoantigens and patients with low tumor mutational burden who would otherwise not qualify for many of the treatment options available today. One exciting possibility we are currently looking into is whether we could use ObsERV™ to identify shared cancer antigens in particular cancer subtypes. This would hold the promise to develop the first precision cancer vaccines targeting indications with no equivalent treatment option to date. Details on this principle were shared at ASH in December this year.\n\n\"With the recent development within cancer and infectious diseases, we have been seeing a further confirmation of our approach and are looking forward to discussing partnering opportunities across all parts of our strategy and associated with our three-pronged business model: Targets, Pipeline, and Responders.\"\n\nChristian Kanstrup Leads Evaxion's AI Strategy as CEO\n\nEvaxion appoints Christian Kanstrup as CEO, emphasizing his unique leadership and strategic development skills.

The collaborative effort highlights Evaxion's dedication to harnessing AI for innovative vaccine design.\n\nEvaxion and Afrigen Join Forces for Gonorrhea mRNA Vaccine\n\nEvaxion Biotech partners with Afrigen Biologics to develop an mRNA vaccine against gonorrhea, utilizing EDEN™-discovered targets. The collaboration, leveraging mRNA technology from the WHO and Medicines Patent Pool, aims to address the global medical need for a gonorrhea vaccine. Evaxion CEO Christian Kanstrup sees this collaboration as a strategic step to bring AI-designed vaccines to market, emphasizing the importance of identifying the right partners.\n\nEvaxion's EVX-01 Phase 2 Trial Shows Promise in Personalized Cancer Treatment\n\nEvaxion Biotech reports encouraging Phase 2 data for its personalized cancer vaccine, EVX-01, confirming earlier Phase 1 findings. Notably, a metastatic melanoma patient with initial progressive disease showed significant and continuous tumor reduction after EVX-01 treatment. CEO Christian Kanstrup highlights the potential of their AI-Immunology™ platform to revolutionize oncology.\n\nWebinar: Evaxion Shares Insights on EVX-01 Phase 2 Clinical Data\n\nEvaxion Biotech hosted an online webinar on November 8 featuring KOL Professor Adnan Khattak, one of the principal investigators of the EVX-01 Phase 2 clinical trial. The 30-minute event explores malignant melanoma, summarizes Phase 1 results, and details the Phase 2 update.\n\nEvaxion Introduces AI Model for Predicting Cancer Immunotherapy Responses\n\nEvaxion unveils its AI model at the Biomarkers & Precision Oncology Europe conference, aiming to predict patient responses to cancer immunotherapy.

        "title": "Bill Gates 'optimistic' about role AI could play in solving global challenges in education, health and more",
        "body": "Earlier this year, Microsoft co-founder Bill Gates warned emerging artificial intelligence tools were poised to fundamentally reshape the most popular uses of the internet, potentially killing off powerhouses like Google and Amazon and may eventually power a new wave of worker-droids.\n\nBut multi-billionaire Gates, who stepped away from Microsoft day-to-day operations in 2008 to engage in full-time philanthropic endeavors, focused on more optimistic potentials for AI in his annual year-end letter released Tuesday.\n\nAt a May artificial intelligence conference hosted by financial giant Goldman Sachs and Silicon Valley venture firm SV Angel, Gates said he believed a yet-to-be-developed AI-driven personal assistant is likely to take over humdrum human tasks like searching the internet, shopping and even engaging with online productivity tools. That's because the new digital helpers will be keyed-in to users' needs in a way that will obsolesce many of the current, mainstay uses of the internet.\n\n\"Whoever wins the personal agent, that's the big thing, because you will never go to a search site again, you will never go to a productivity site, you'll never go to Amazon again,\" Gates said in May.\n\nHe also suggested that, in the future, AI-powered humanoid robots will become more affordable than human laborers and begin replacing blue collar workers.\n\nGates chose, however, to focus on more altruistic potentials for artificial intelligence in a year-in-review posting Tuesday on his \"Gates Notes\" blog.\n\nGates said putting innovation to work has been a core motivator throughout his life and was the impetus behind Microsoft as well as the philanthropic organization, the Gates Foundations, he and his ex-wife Melinda Gates founded in 1994.\n\nGates believes AI-powered innovations will begin fundamentally re-shaping the world and he sees opportunity for the new technology to help abate some of the most critical issues facing humanity.\n\n\"In a world with limited resources, you have to find ways to maximize impact,\" Gates wrote. \"Innovation is the key to getting the most out of every dollar spent. And artificial intelligence is about to accelerate the rate of new discoveries at a pace we've never seen before.\"\n\nHere are some of the pressing questions Gates believes may be addressed by emerging AI tools:\n\nCan AI combat antibiotic resistance?\n\nGates notes the work of Nana Kofi Quakyi from the Aurum Institute in Ghana who is working on an AI-powered tool that helps health workers prescribe antibiotics without contributing to antimicrobial resistance. The tool will comb through all the available information -- including local clinical guidelines and health surveillance data about which pathogens are currently at risk of developing resistance in the area -- and make suggestions for the best drug, dosage, and duration.\n\nCan AI bring personalized tutors to every student?\n\nGates is impressed with a number of new education-focused AI tools that are approaching the challenge by tailoring lessons to the needs of individual users while also incorporating culture-specific customization. Gates cites Khanmigo, MATHia and Somanasi as platforms that are showing positive outcomes with this approach.\n\nCan AI help treat high-risk pregnancies?\n\nGates notes that, across the globe, a woman dies in childbirth every two minutes. Gates said he met earlier this year with researchers from ARMMAN, who hope to use artificial intelligence to improve the odds for new mothers in India. ARMMAN's large language model is being developed to act as a copilot for health workers treating high-risk pregnancies. It can be used in both English and Telugu, and automatically adjusts to the experience level of the person using it -- whether you're a brand-new nurse or a midwife with decades of experience.\n\nCould AI make medical information easier to access for every health worker?\n\nGates wrote about Maryam Mustafa's team, working on a voice-enabled mobile app that would make it a lot easier for maternal health workers in Pakistan to create medical records. It asks a series of prompts about a patient and uses the responses to fill out a standard medical record. Arming health workers with more data will hopefully improve the country's pregnancy outcomes, which are among the worst in the world.\n\nGates wrote in his year-end posting that \"it's clearer than ever how AI can be used to improve access to education, mental health, and more\" and pledged to support emerging AI-driven technologies aiming to better the world.\n\n\"It motivates me to make sure this technology helps reduce -- and doesn't contribute to -- the awful inequities we see around the world,\" Gates wrote. \"I've always been a firm believer in the power of innovation to offer every child an equal chance to survive and thrive. AI is no exception.\"",

        "title": "CFOs must take an ROI-centered approach to global expansion",
        "body": "To access top talent in new markets, finance chiefs need to keep their focus on value creation and ROI, CFO Simone Nardi advises.\n\nHiring skilled, local talent is key for businesses looking to establish a global footprint, but it's important for business leaders to understand that different markets come with their own cultural, social and regulatory distinctions.\n\nIn that vein, \"when we talk about global expansion, we're not talking about one solution that fits all,\" said Simone Nardi, CFO of SaaS provider Globalization Partners. \"We're talking about solutions that need to be tailored and compliant.\"\n\nThe remote-first company provides a global growth solution which helps firms manage their global workforce through one platform. Nardi has served as G-P's CFO since May of 2022, according to his LinkedIn profile, joining from live TV streaming platform FuboTV. His previous roles include an eight-year tenure at NCBUniversal, where he served in various positions including as SVP and CFO, NBC Universal Networks, and he started his career at General Electric.\n\nThe CFO has an important role to play in establishing a global expansion strategy. When considering when and how effective it will be to hire international talent or enter new markets, \"at the end of the day, the opportunity for a CFO is to kind of ensure that the company finds the best solution, the best opportunity for it to expand and grow,\" Nardi said.\n\nFinding global talent can provide benefits for CFOs, tasked with ensuring they are creating the most effective pathway to growth -- for one, it can help finance chiefs access skills or talents they may not be able to find domestically as they face talent shortages in areas like accounting. For another, hiring local talent can be beneficial from a return-on-investment perspective, acting as a bridge to \"understand the market better as an insider, as a local player\" who can help them perfect their expansion strategy, Nardi said.\n\nBringing that ROI perspective to global expansion is key on the part of CFOs as the executives which \"want to ensure that we optimize value creation for the company,\" Nardi said.\n\n\"Typically, what that means is being the enabler to see what the company is trying to achieve, and how the teams are running the day-to-day operation for the business, to find the best solution,\" he said of how finance chiefs think of value creation.\n\nHowever, as finance chiefs come to play a greater strategic role in such decisions, it's also important to understand that each market comes with its own individual quirks; \"everyone knows there are multiple markets, but not everyone appreciates, straightaway, the diversity, and complexity\" of each new market.\n\nOne crucial distinction that does tend to be top of mind for CFOs and other executive leaders when looking to expand is compliance. Businesses need to juggle a host of regulations that come into play when setting up shop in a new market, not just when it comes to tax or payment regulatory requirements for employees but in crucial areas like cybersecurity -- an area where lawmakers worldwide have begun to pay closer attention.\n\nAttempting to balance each market's distinct regulatory requirements for employment, payments and other standards can be cumbersome -- and not to mention, costly -- for businesses, in some cases eliminating some of the benefits from hiring global talent.\n\nBeing able to understand the labor laws in each country and learning how to properly manage them is critical for businesses to \"mitigate any concern about the ability to operate properly, how to get to the right level,\" Nardi said.\n\nEmerging technologies such as artificial intelligence can aid CFOs with this compliance juggling act. AI is built into G-P's platform and helps \"across the board\" in helping to provide information about compliance with the various tax, financial, cybersecurity and employment regulations companies need to properly operate in global markets, Nardi said.\n\nIt's important to shine a light on the database behind AI, however; G-P's AI tool is drawing upon the company's collective knowledge of these compliance areas, enabling it to provide the key insights businesses need, as \"ultimately, to have a compelling AI solution, you need to have a compelling data set,\" Nardi said. \"Because AI is as smart as the data and the knowledge base it has.\"",

As former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos settles in Miami, a move he announced last month, Gates will become the richest person in Washington state.\n\nGates and ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, have donated billions of dollars to a variety of causes through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Last year, he announced he would give away virtually his entire fortune through the foundation. \"I will move down and eventually off of the list of the world's richest people,\" he said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nArtificial intelligence\n\nGates' forecast on AI goes beyond last year's ultrasound prediction, asserting that AI progress will broadly improve global health while enabling innovation in developed and developing countries.\n\n\"Artificial intelligence is about to accelerate the rate of new discoveries at a pace we've never seen before,\" Gates wrote.\n\nAI could help communities around the world with combating antibiotic resistant diseases, helping non-English speakers manage high-risk pregnancies and making medical information easier to access for health workers.\n\nStill, he said, \"there is a long road ahead for projects like these.\" Hurdles include scaling the technology without sacrificing quality and ensuring functionality over time.\n\n...continued",

Mack, .\n\nIn this clip, Mack speaks with Technology Tools for Today (T3) Conference Producer Joel Bruckenstein just a few months before a major conference milestone of his own: From Jan. 22-25, the T3 conference celebrate its 20th anniversary in Las Vegas, Nevada, carrying forward the vision Bruckenstein and co-producer David Drucker first brought to life two decades ago.\n\nThe theme of the special T3 is the past, present and future of the financial services industry, and how emerging technologies and artificial intelligence/machine learning will change the landscape.\n\nAt Future Proof 2023, Bruckenstein was tapped into the conversations happening on the ground and found a couple of recurring themes dominating much of the beachside chatter.\n\n\"Clearly it's about mass personalization, right? And getting more efficient and being able to serve more clients and serve them better. And obviously, everybody's talking about AI,\" he said. But you know, in my opinion, it's very early in the game with AI. There's a lot of experimentation going on, there's a few products that have come to market. But even the products that have come to market I think are a fraction of what you're going to see over the next couple of years.\"\n\nHe added that Future Proof's vision is one that stands up once you get a chance to make your way through the hype and take part in it yourself.\n\n\"This is very different from the typical industry conference. It's sort of gratifying to see that it's attracting a new demographic that I don't think typically goes to conferences. So I think that's cool,\" Bruckenstein said. \"I just think the whole vibe, it's so different than anything else that the industry has ever done before. And it's kind of refreshing.\"\n\nCheck out the full interview below.\n\nFuture Proof, an event billed as the first wealth festival, is making its return next summer and dates for Future Proof 2024 have already been announced. The event is slated to return to Huntington Beach Sept. 15-18, 2024.\n\nFuture Proof is also expanding in the new year with the addition of Future Proof Retreat, an additional event for wealth management leaders that will take place March 24-27 in Colorado Springs.",

        "title": "Why Engagement Capabilities Will Define The Future of Media and Entertainment",
        "body": "Streaming media has undergone rapid growth and evolution over the past few years, with ad-supported models gaining traction - evidenced by the success of Netflix's \"Basic With Ads\" tier now counting 15 million monthly active viewers just one year after launch. However, there appears to be a ceiling to how much consumers are willing to pay in total subscription costs. As major players like Netflix, Hulu, and Amazon look to diversify revenue streams, one area offering significant untapped potential is user engagement.\n\nHeading into 2024, new engagement-focused offerings that move beyond ads to unlock new revenue opportunities will be a crucial element in expanding free, ad-supported TV (FAST) channels. Players in the media and entertainment industry that can successfully introduce creative features and gain viewers' active involvement in content stand to benefit tremendously.\n\nThere are a few ways engagement capabilities can be integrated into existing content to expand revenue streams, the most obvious of which is content gamification. Adding gamified elements into programming incentivizes viewers to watch for longer, and even to make purchases. These microtransactions linked to interactive games, trivia, polls that precede or overlay popular shows can add up quickly across a large subscriber base. For instance, by facilitating just $1 in extra monthly purchases per customer, a provider with 10 million subscribers could boost annual revenue by $120 million on the back of engagement-driven micropayments.\n\nLive commerce and novel applications of artificial intelligence present similar opportunities for entertainment providers to convert fan enthusiasm into revenue via real-time engagement. Shoppable programming, for example, enables the seamless purchase of on-screen products unlocking increased e-commerce sales for advertisers. AI integrations like interactive chatbots, on the other hand, can provide a concierge-style purchasing experience - converting engaged viewers into buyers through hyper-relevant promotions and offers that are native to the viewing experience.\n\nThese types of innovative and multi-faceted engagement strategies enhance entertainment offerings, enabling the active involvement of modern audiences. Media companies that creatively involve audiences in what they watch stand to gain significant advantages in three critical areas:\n\nInnovative integrations of interactive components into programming, like the NFL's augmented Toy Story broadcast, demonstrate new avenues to lengthen viewing sessions by entertaining hard-to-captivate demographics without compromising core fans. As consumer taste continues fragmenting amid endless entertainment choice, customization and personalization will be key. Platforms that allow fans to tailor viewing experiences, such as selecting specialized avatars and camera angles for live events, stand to gain an edge in retaining fickle modern audiences.\n\nPrioritizing investments in mobile-first engagement strategies also promises to pay dividends moving forward. With younger demographics increasingly consuming content predominantly on internet-connected devices, providers need to meet this cohort where they already live. Social media and messaging integrations that tap into digital-native viewing habits can drive higher engagement levels, view times, and, crucially, subscription loyalty.\n\nIntegrating social features directly into streaming apps provides an opportunity to foster brand affinity by facilitating authentic fan-to-fan and fan-to-star interactions. Two-way interfaces enable platforms to build owned communities centered around beloved talent and programming, where like-minded fans intermingle in real-time. This community-building promises to boost meaningful engagement, turning casual viewers into vocal brand champions, while also allowing providers to gain direct access to invaluable first-party data on superfans for informing content decisions.\n\nBuilding superior user engagement capacities promises tremendous upside for media companies that are able to execute it successfully. Features that facilitate meaningful engagement between viewers and content can drive real business results by cultivating an enthusiastic and loyal subscriber base.",

        "title": "CIA's AI efforts focus on training, monitoring, augmenting human analysts | Federal News Network",
        "body": "The intelligence community has to be very careful about the ways it implements artificial intelligence, because of the stakes of its work and its proximity to policy. That makes it even more important to have humans in the loop to evaluate AI inputs and outputs, and why AI chatbots like ChatGPT won't replace human analysts at the CIA any time soon.\n\n\"It's very important that when we're using AI systems to help our officers and to start to move to collaborate with our officers, we need to make sure that their tradecraft is incorporating this new sometimes novel technology that they might not have already used, or they've been using it for a while and things are shifting,\" Lakshmi Raman, chief artificial intelligence officer at the CIA, said on Federal Monthly Insights - AI/ML Systems. \"Augmenting training for AI all the way from our general workforce to our senior leaders so they understand how it can help them do their jobs is also a huge focus of the work we're doing at the agency.\"\n\nRaman said generative AI and large language models really \"caught the intelligence community by storm\" in late 2022, when its potential to augment human analysts became clear. And that's precisely what the CIA wants to do: Augment its human analysts, not replace them, in order to enable the agency's mission.\n\nOne of the top opportunities Raman sees, particularly for generative AI, is the sheer scale of the CIA's data collection.\n\n\"It's always been a challenge for our officers to sift through all of that information to find the relevant pieces of information they need,\" she told the Federal Drive with Tom Temin. \"And so we've made really significant progress in using [large language models] to help that workforce manage the open source data they collect. So they're using it to cluster search and summarize events, which in turn makes it easier to identify important information and to delve deeper when needed.\"\n\nBut the CIA certainly isn't starry-eyed about these new technologies; Raman said the agency is prioritizing supply chain risk management, systems security monitoring, and other security processes in their adoption and implementation. One of the biggest risks she said the CIA is concerned with is data poisoning, where attacks seed malicious data into the training sets used by AI in order to bias or otherwise undermine the results delivered.\n\nRaman said to mitigate this risk, CIA is implementing monitoring beyond just the usual application programming interface endpoints, with a focus on the outputs of their AI models.\n\n\"We're ensuring that we are accounting for those specific needs,\" she said. \"How are we governing all of this? How are we ensuring that we are looking at the appropriate levels of risk mitigation at every portion of that process that I just described? And it also is about how do we make sure that we have the right training, tooling and our officers have the right tradecraft to understand what this looks like and what this means.\"\n\nBecause the AI models CIA uses are more probabilistic than other software, which is usually more deterministic, that training is important to determine when changes in quality of the outputs are occurring. She said model drift is a function of data drift over time, so it's important that governance is built into the agency's AI governance plan, but also continuously evaluated.\n\nAnd that's where the training comes in: Many federal agencies are having a difficult time competing with the private sector for talent in the data science field. Upskilling current employees is one solution that many are exploring to help ease that challenge. Raman said CIA is also extending its partnerships with academia, national labs, and within the IC itself. One example of that is an IC AI model exchange, which allows them to share capabilities and encourages trust and transparency between intelligence agencies. But there's still plenty of work to go around.\n\n\"The talent bottleneck is a huge challenge for us, and we at the agency have an incredibly talented AI practitioner workforce: data scientists, analytic methodologies, business analysts,\" Raman said. \"They are really top of the line. But boy, does the demand for their services exceeds the supply.\"",

        "title": "China, Russia, Iran and Cuba all tried to meddle in 2022 US congressional elections, intelligence assessment finds - WSVN 7News | Miami News, Weather, Sports | Fort Lauderdale",
        "body": "(CNN) -- Foreign government efforts to target the 2022 US midterm elections appeared to grow compared with the 2018 elections, according to a declassified intelligence assessment released Monday, with a \"diverse and growing group of foreign actors\" participating.\n\nThere was no known order from any foreign leader to \"undertake a comprehensive, whole-of-government influence campaign\" like the one Russia carried out in 2016, according to the report. But the assessment found that China, Russia, Iran and Cuba all tried to meddle in congressional elections in 2022.\n\nThe intelligence community assesses with high confidence that China \"tacitly approved efforts to try to influence a handful of midterm races involving members of both US political parties\" - likely as part of a broad series of directives by Chinese Communist Party leaders since 2020 to \"intensify efforts to influence US policy and public opinion in China's favor.\"\n\nChina intensified its efforts to heighten sociopolitical divisions, according to the assessment, but still focused more on efforts to support or undermine a small number of specific candidates based on whether Beijing perceived their policy positions to be in its favor. Party leaders \"repeatedly have instructed officials to focus on Congress because Beijing is convinced that Congress is a locus of anti-China activity,\" according to the report.\n\nStill, \"Beijing almost certainly viewed the US midterm elections as an opportunity to portray the US democratic model as chaotic, ineffective, and unrepresentative, and frequently directed [People's Republic of China] messaging to highlight US divisions on social issues, such as abortion and gun control.\"\n\nUS intelligence agencies' conclusion that China has been more active in election influence activities aligns with reports from tech firms. Suspected Chinese operatives have used images made by artificial intelligence to mimic American voters online and provoke discussion on divisive political issues, Microsoft analysts warned in September.\n\nChinese officials likely had freer rein to conduct influence operations because they believed they were under \"less scrutiny during the midterms\" and that the risk of any US retaliation was lower than in 2020, the US intelligence report said.\n\nRussia, meanwhile, sought \"to denigrate the Democratic Party before the midterm elections and undermine confidence in the election, most likely to undermine US support for Ukraine,\" the intelligence community assessed, also with high confidence.\n\nThe intelligence community found that the Kremlin \"conducted extensive research and analysis of US audiences,\" identifying key demographics, narratives and platforms that it believed would be effective in amplifying Russia's message. Among those targeted audiences were \"US constituencies that they believed were more sympathetic to Russia's emphasis on 'traditional values,'\" according to the assessment, which describes the findings as some of the \"most explicit reporting to date on Russia's US-focused influence operations.\"\n\nThe assessment also confirms that Russian military officials proposed delaying the Russian withdrawal from the Ukrainian city of Kherson until the day after the 2022 midterms \"to avoid giving a named US political party a perceived win before the election.\"\n\nRussian actors also generally sought to weaken confidence in Western democratic institutions, the assessment found, by \"[casting] aspersions on the integrity of the midterm elections, including by claiming that voting software was vulnerable, Americans expected cheating to undermine the midterm elections, and Democrats were stealing the elections.\"\n\nThe assessment also detailed Iran's influence activities during the midterms, finding that Tehran sought to exploit perceived social divisions and undermine confidence in US democratic institutions - but that its efforts were limited by competing priorities, including the need to manage internal unrest.\n\nBroadly, intelligence officials found, foreign actors shied away from technically challenging efforts to change literal votes and instead sought to influence US elections by damaging the public perception of the integrity of their results.\n\nThe intelligence community also observed that other countries - including Cuba - engaged in more narrow efforts to support or undermine specific candidates, apparently predicated on the candidate's willingness to advance policies that aligned with that country's interest.\n\nThe assessment did not study the impact the influence campaigns may have had on the outcome of the 2022 elections.\n\nCNN's Sean Lyngaas contributed to this report.\n\nThe-CNN-Wire\n\n™ & © 2023 Cable News Network, Inc., a Warner Bros.

        "body": "Large-cap growth ETFs have been on fire this year. One fund stands apart from the crowd, however.\n\nLarge-cap growth stocks have been soaring this year, driven by the strong demand for artificial intelligence and cutting-edge weight loss drugs. Consequently, several exchange-traded funds (ETFs) that focus on these themes have delivered impressive returns this year. Perhaps most importantly, though, this trend is likely to continue in the coming years as AI becomes more pervasive and more next-generation weight loss medicines hit the market.\n\nHow can investors choose the best large-cap growth ETF to take advantage of this trend? To answer this question, I compared three of the most popular funds in this category. Keep reading to find out more.\n\nOne of the best ways to invest in large-cap growth stocks is through ETFs that track this segment of the market. Among the most popular ETFs in this category are the iShares S&P 500 Growth ETF (IVW 0.35%), the Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF (SCHG 0.36%), and the Vanguard Growth Index Fund (VUG 0.41%).\n\nThese funds are all designed to replicate the performance of a benchmark index of large-cap growth stocks. They also have low fees, consistently strong returns over the prior 10 years, and exposure to key growth themes like AI and obesity care.\n\nThe table below outlines each fund's key metrics and compares them to the Vanguard 500 Index Fund (VOO 0.48%), which tracks the S&P 500.\n\nAlpha and betas refer to the ETF's performance relative to the S&P 500 over the past 36 months. Total returns assume the dividend was reinvested and taxes were deferred over the theoretical holding period.\n\nAll of these large-cap growth ETFs handily outperformed the benchmark S&P 500 over the past 10 years. However, one of them stands out from the rest in terms of performance and cost efficiency. The SCHG, offered by Charles Schwab, has delivered the highest total returns among the trio, and it matches the Vanguard Growth Index Fund on the expense ratio front.\n\nFor investors who prioritize liquidity, though, the IVW might be a better choice, as it has the highest average daily volume of the three ETFs at around 1.97 million shares traded over the past three months. This feature makes it more suitable for active trading strategies. That being said, the other two funds are also highly liquid, making them suitable for most lay investors, especially those with a long-term outlook.\n\nAlthough all three of these large-cap growth ETFs may be worth buying as part of a diversified portfolio, the Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF is arguably the best choice if you can only buy one of these supercharged funds. It offers extremely low fees and superior returns compared with its immediate peers in the same category.",

Salesforce now predicts BOPIS usage will surge during Christmas Week (Dec. 18-25), with one-third of online orders fulfilled via BOPIS as holiday ground shipping deadlines close.\n\nIn addition, analysis of hopping data from over 1.5 billion consumers across the Salesforce Customer 360 platform indicates the percentage of returns more than doubled in the week following Cyber Monday and has remained high since. Salesforce now predicts over $131 billion worth of online orders purchased this holiday season will be returned in the next year.\n\nOther interesting online holiday sales figures from Salesforce include:\n\n\"Seamless fulfillment and easy returns will be key strategies for retailers looking to increase loyalty and profitability through the remainder of the holiday,\" said Rob Garf, VP and GM of Retail and Consumer Goods, Salesforce. \"Retailers that are efficiently fulfilling online orders from physical stores, especially during these peak shopping days, can extend their shipping cutoff date and win market share.\"",

        "body": "Bluebird Network - a communications infrastructure provider and operator of more than 11,000 miles of fiber and two data centers - recently announced that it has received $285 million of five-year Senior Secured Credit Facilities. The proceeds from the Credit Facilities were used to refinance Bluebird's existing indebtedness and will fund ongoing capital expenditures, including network upgrades, expansion into new markets, and an awarded Middle Mile grant build. TD Securities acted as the Lead Left Arranger on the financing and is the Administrative Agent for the Credit Facilities.\n\nEven though interest rates remain high, tightened and scrupulous lending by financial institutions has put new sights on the global digital infrastructure market. And the confidence in Bluebird's business model is a testament to the company's ability to execute on its plans. With an existing rise in digital infrastructure needs and the expected meteoric rise in bandwidth demand driven by Artificial Intelligence, the value of the global AI infrastructure market is projected to reach $309.4 billion by 2031 (Allied Market Research).\n\nIn the past year, Bluebird has built over 360 new route miles of fiber and expanded into several additional markets throughout Missouri, Illinois, and Iowa. And this new financing provides Bluebird with the capital to execute development plans in accordance with the company's strategic vision to have a fiber presence in 80 percent of cities with a population of 10,000 people or more across its 11-state footprint in the Midwest.\n\nBeyond market densification projects, in 2024, Bluebird is planning more long-haul fiber routes and recently completed an underground river crossing in St. Louis, traversing the Mississippi River and adding a new, diverse route to its network offerings. In 2023, the company was awarded a grant as part of the U.S. Department of Commerce's Enabling Middle Mile Broadband Infrastructure Program. And the grant will be used to build a highly desirable route connecting St. Louis and Tulsa, which is expected to be completed over the next four years.\n\nKEY QUOTES:\n\n\"We're thrilled to announce the closing of this refinancing. It's a point of pride that we're viewed by lenders as a trustworthy company to work with.\"\n\n\"The upsized credit facilities will enable us to execute goals we've laid out for 2024 and beyond. This includes growing our fiber network and continuing to take advantage of strategic opportunities as they may arise.\"",

The SCHG, offered by Charles Schwab, has delivered the highest total returns among the trio, and it matches the Vanguard Growth Index Fund on the expense ratio front.\n\nFor investors who prioritize liquidity, though, the IVW might be a better choice, as it has the highest average daily volume of the three ETFs at around 1.97 million shares traded over the past three months. This feature makes it more suitable for active trading strategies. That being said, the other two funds are also highly liquid, making them suitable for most lay investors, especially those with a long-term outlook.\n\nAlthough all three of these large-cap growth ETFs may be worth buying as part of a diversified portfolio, the Schwab U.S. Large-Cap Growth ETF is arguably the best choice if you can only buy one of these supercharged funds. It offers extremely low fees and superior returns compared with its immediate peers in the same category.\n\nShould you invest $1,000 in Charles Schwab right now?\n\nBefore you buy stock in Charles Schwab, consider this:\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Charles Schwab wasn't one of them.

        "title": "Regulation Could Shape AI in 2024, With Big Tech Best Poised To Gain, Experts Say",
        "body": "Big tech companies could be best poised to gain from regulation, according to Goldman Sachs research, with a Wedbush Securities analyst indicating that Microsoft Corp. leads the pack.\n\nAfter President Joe Biden issued an artificial intelligence (AI)-focused executive order in 2023, experts suggest it's only the beginning of AI regulation in the U.S.\n\nWith more AI regulation anticipated in 2024, tech giants, like Microsoft Corp. (MSFT), could be best positioned to gain while regulators work to keep up with the emerging technology.\n\nAs advancing AI tech is further integrated into people's lives, regulation has become a growing priority intended to limit the risks associated with the tech.\n\n\"Privacy, safety, security, transparency, avoiding bias and discrimination, and accountability,\" are common themes considered in AI regulation, Duane Pozza, a lawyer at Wiley in Washington, D.C., who's focused on legislation involving emerging tech, told Investopedia.\n\nPresident Biden took the first steps toward widespread AI regulation in 2023.\n\nBefore issuing an executive order outlining general safeguards for AI use, Biden enlisted voluntary agreements from major companies leading the development of the tech including Google parent Alphabet Inc. (GOOGL), Facebook parent Meta Platforms Inc. (META), Amazon.com Inc. (AMZN), Microsoft (MSFT), OpenAI Inc. and Nvidia Corp. (NVDA).\n\n\"One thing is clear: To realize the promise of AI and avoid the risks, we need to govern this technology,\" President Biden said, noting he considers the executive order \"the most significant action any government anywhere in the world has ever taken on AI safety, security, and trust.\"\n\n\"AI policy is like running a decathlon,\" White House special advisor for AI, Ben Buchanan, told Investopedia. Buchanan, who was involved in the creation of the executive order, said that \"from [the] thicket of AI and civil rights to the intersection of AI national security, AI and workers' rights, and consumers,\" the president is prepared to address \"all the different ways in which AI can affect our society.\"\n\nCompanies across the world are working on AI but regulation in the U.S. specifically could serve as an international standard.\n\n\"Right now, it's an American technology,\" Haim Israel, head of global thematic research at Bank of America, said, telling Investopedia that AI regulation is something his firm is monitoring in 2024.\n\nBiden's executive order is a step toward widespread regulation but is not the only way that the government is working to implement AI guidelines.\n\nThe \"Biden executive order is going to have a lot of impacts throughout what agencies are doing in the government, but has very limited ability to require private companies to do certain things,\" Wiley's Pozza said, highlighting that the executive branch of the federal government isn't alone in exploring regulation.\n\nSector-specific agencies, like the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Food and Drug Administration (FDA), work in industries that are already heavily regulated where there is \"no AI exemption from [existing] policies,\" Pozza noted, as opposed to some areas where the law is less clear.\n\nSome state governments are considering AI-focused laws, with California being \"the state to watch in 2024,\" Pozzo said, as state legislators consider proposals that would require companies to do mandatory risk assessments.\n\nA major difficulty that those creating AI policies face is keeping up with the rapidly evolving technology.\n\nBiden's 2023 executive order provides flexibility for adjustments, according to White House special advisor Buchanan, \"as time goes on because we know that technology might move in ways that we don't expect.\"\n\n\"Self-regulation by the tech industry around AI will be key,\" Dan Ives, a tech analyst at Wedbush Securities told Investopedia, saying that \"regulators are going 25 mph in the right lane while AI tech and Big Tech are in a Ferrari going 100 mph in the left lane.\"\n\nIves indicated that the firm isn't expecting robust AI regulation until 2024 or even 2025, as AI emerges as \"the biggest tech transformation since the start of the Internet.\"\n\nTech giants could be poised to benefit disproportionately from wide-reaching regulation, experts suggest.\n\n\"The impulse toward early regulation of AI technology may also favor large, well-capitalized companies,\" Goldman Sachs research found.\n\n\"Regulation typically comes with higher costs and higher barriers to entry,\" Eric Sheridan, senior equity research analyst at Goldman, said in a report, noting that the \"larger technology companies can absorb the costs of building these large language models, afford some of these computing costs, as well as comply with regulation.\"\n\nIn 2023, big tech company shares experienced a rally that outpaced the market at large, which may reflect \"investors recognizing the potential such players have to develop transformative AI applications,\" Goldman's research said.\n\nIves, the Wedbush analyst, echoed a similar sentiment, saying that the \"lack of consensus\" in Washington \"makes Big Tech the winner for now, led by Microsoft.\"",

        "title": "In search of the missing piece of generative AI: Unstructured data",
        "body": "Enterprises have long wrestled with unstructured data. Now, they have another reason to pursue it -- to support and be supported by AI.\n\nIn recent years, the spotlight has been on unstructured data -- text, graphics, documents, IoT streams -- all streams of data that hold tremendous, untapped value. The database industry underwent a continent-size shift to better accommodate and hopefully surface these assets.\n\nAlso: What is generative AI and why is it so popular? Here's everything you need to know\n\nOften, a lack of awareness of truly hidden unstructured data sources or assets frustrated these efforts. While it is estimated that 90% of the information across enterprises is unstructured data, only 46% of organizations have made efforts to extract its value, according to an IDC survey.\n\nNow, technology and business leaders have another reason for pursuing and surfacing unstructured data: The rise of generative artificial intelligence.\n\nThe companies and IT professionals that pushed themselves forward with unstructured data in recent years may find themselves in a better position to take advantage of generative AI -- and, conversely, employ AI to dig deeper into data stores.\n\nIt's time for enterprises to step up \"management of unstructured data from sources such as IoT, as well as knowledge documents -- PowerPoints, text, Excel spreadsheets,\" says Matt Labovich, US data, analytics, and AI leader at PwC. \"They all contain valuable institutional knowledge about business operations and hold insights that can be harnessed using gen AI.\"\n\nWhile structured data strategies have traditionally received the majority of attention, it's time to turn attention to \"the significant role of unstructured data in the advancement of gen AI,\" Labovich urges.\n\nWhile previous AI initiatives had to focus on use cases where structured data was ready and abundant, \"the complexity of collecting, annotating, and synthesizing heterogeneous datasets made wider AI initiatives unviable,\" according to a recent global survey published in MIT Technology Review Insights, underwritten by Databricks.\n\n\"By contrast, generative AI's new ability to surface and utilize once-hidden data will power extraordinary new advances across the organization,\" writes the report's author, Adam Green.\n\nAlso: AI is growing into its role as a development and testing assistant\n\nThe ability to capture and pull value from such data is considered more critical than ever. Almost 70% of the survey's participating technology executives agree that data problems are the most likely factor to jeopardize their AI and machine learning goals. \"Text-generating AI systems, such as the popular ChatGPT, are built on large language models,\" Green says. \"LLMs train on a vast corpus of data to answer questions or perform tasks based on statistical likelihoods.\"\n\nAI applications \"rely on a solid data infrastructure that makes possible the collection, storage, and analysis of its\n\nvast data-verse,\" Green adds. \"Even before the business applications of generative AI became\n\napparent in late 2022, a unified data platform for analytics and AI was viewed as crucial by nearly 70% of our survey respondents.\"\n\nMore than two-thirds of survey respondents agree that unifying their data platforms for analytics and AI is crucial to their enterprise data strategies. The generative AI era requires a data infrastructure that is flexible, scalable, and efficient. The key is to \"democratize access to data and analytics, enhance security, and combine low-cost storage with high-performance querying.\"\n\nPulling together unstructured data for today's AI is no overnight task. \"Mergers and acquisitions have resulted in fragmented IT architectures. Important documents, from research and development intelligence to design instructions for plants, have been lost to view, locked in offline proprietary file types,\" Green points out in the MIT report.\n\nAlso: The promise and peril of AI at work in 2024, according to Deloitte's Tech Trends report\n\n\"Could we interrogate these documents using LLMs? Can we train models to give us insights we're not seeing in this vast world of documentation?\"\n\nAccording to Andrew Blyton, vice president and chief information officer of Incyte, and former VP of DuPont Water & Protection, \"We think that's an obvious use case. Language models promise to make such unstructured data much more valuable.\"\n\nBringing data owners, analysts, and users into the process from across the business is also key to data success with gen AI. \"It's not solely the responsibility of the CIO,\" says Labovich. \"Business leaders must take charge, while the CIO enables and supports the process. Operational readiness and change management are key, which involves having executives across the business actively participating in the identification of critical data, embedding into workflows, and assuming the role of change champions to foster widespread adoption.\"",

        "title": "2024 healthcare services outlook: Challenges and opportunities",
        "body": "Healthcare services comprise a range of organizations, from technology companies and financial sponsors to pharmacies, that focus on the payer and health systems markets. Over the past decade, each of these segments has rapidly grown in number of stand-alone entities and total profit pools. We summarize our views on what 2024 holds for these key segments below.\n\nThree areas stand out in terms of opportunities and challenges:\n\nData analytics and artificial intelligence (AI). Generative AI has aroused interest in health services and technology but use case development and deployment are in their early days.Wider adoption of AI could lead to savings of 5 to 10 percent in US healthcare spending, or about $200 billion to $360 billion annually in 2019 dollars. For more, see David M. Cutler, Nikhil Sahni, George Stein, and Rodney Zemmel, The potential impact of artificial intelligence on healthcare spending, National Bureau of Economic Research, September 2022. Payers and health systems that have already invested in data analytics (as well as related infrastructure and governance) are beginning to differentiate themselves from competitors. We anticipate a greater focus on use cases that enable clear, near-term operational value -- for example, AI that supports more rapid throughput of imaging equipment. Overcoming history, especially with health systems for which investment in technology has underwhelmed in terms of productivity gains, will be essential for health services to fulfill AI's promise.\n\nOutsourcing. Strategic players, especially not-for-profit health systems and payers, are facing financial headwinds. While many are reticent to outsource given the impact on employees locally, the combination of the financial value proposition, rising gaps in capabilities, and the inability to otherwise access required talent is increasingly compelling. Outsourcing transactions often involve legacy processes that benefit from scale and automation (for example, transactional functions such as human resources and finance), but we are also seeing more point solutions and adoption in critical healthcare-specific business functions such as revenue cycle management.\n\nProgrammatic M&A. Many healthcare services and technology companies have seen substantial reductions in their most recent valuations. Several have had to shut down or seek alternatives despite cutting R&D spending and loss-leading customer acquisition programs. Strategic and PE investors now have an opportunity to add both talent and capabilities by acquiring these entities on favorable terms; advantageous refinancing for not-for-profit health systems through 2021 may enable not-for-profit health systems to diversify as opportunities arise.\n\nGlobal private equity deal volume in healthcare rose about 8 percent annually from 2017 to 2022. This period includes a material pull-back in 2022, when deal volume fell 37 percent year over year.McKinsey Global Private Markets Review: Private markets turn down the volume, McKinsey, March 21, 2023. Nevertheless, healthcare-focused fundraising remained resilient, with first quarter of 2023 fundraising posting the second highest first-quarter total on record.Louise Fordham, \"Chart: Fundraising for healthcare-focused private equity is in good shape,\" Private Equity International, July 3, 2023.\n\nWe see the following trends in 2024, especially as industry expectations of valuations and anticipated rates of return continue to reset:\n\nCarve-outs. As healthcare organizations have reduced R&D spending and completed portfolio evaluations in 2023, these strategic players have shown increasing interest in divesting business units that are further away from the core. Simultaneously, private equity (PE) firms and PE-backed assets have expressed interest in segments with attractive profit pools.\n\nPublic-to-private deals. Reduced valuations have increased the potential for opportunistic buying, especially from public assets for which PE has a strong value creation thesis. We expect an increasing number of these proposals to include partnerships between PE and strategic investors.\n\nThe pharmacy market has undergone major changes in recent years, including from the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic, establishment of partnerships across the value chain, and the introduction of new pharmacy models. Pharmacy dispensing revenue increased by 9 percent in 2022, to $550 billion, and is projected to grow at a 5 percent CAGR, reaching $700 billion in 2027.Adam J. Fein, The 2023 Economic Report on U.S. pharmacies and pharmacy benefit managers, Drug Channels Institute, March 2023; This measure excludes rebates and discounts paid by manufacturers to pharmacy benefit managers and plan sponsors. It includes pharmacy benefit drugs only.\n\nContinued pressure on the retail pharmacy. Retail pharmacies will continue to face reimbursement challenges, labor shortages, inflationary pressures, and a plateauing of generics dispensing rates. To address these headwinds, we expect that chains will:\n\nGrowth in specialty pharmacy. Specialty pharmacy is one of the fastest-growing subsegments within pharmacy, with revenue rising more than 9 percent annually.The 2023 Economic Report on U.S. Pharmacies and Pharmacy Benefit Managers, 2023. This is due to continued growth in utilization and pricing as well as expansion of the treatment pipeline (for example, cell and gene therapies and oncology and rare disease therapies). The growth is expected to be offset partially by pressure on reimbursements, specialty generics, and increased adoption of biosimilars. Additionally, margins among specialty pharmacy players have been affected by manufacturer contract pharmacy pressures, creating headwinds for larger central fulfillment specialty pharmacies and tailwinds for some health system-owned pharmacies.\n\nEvolving regulatory landscape. The pharmacy segment has seen increased calls from regulators to increase transparency of drug prices and improve affordability. Under the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022, the Medicare prescription drug Part D benefit is being redesigned through 2024-25. The redesign comprises a new beneficiary out-of-pocket spending cap of $2,000 and a substantial increase in plan liability (from 15 percent to 60 percent) in the catastrophic phase of coverage, increasing plans' imperative to manage high-cost drugs. Additionally, the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services (CMS) is set to require pharmacy rebates under Medicare be shared with consumers at the point of sale; it also announced that price transparency rules will apply to prescription drugs. There are several bipartisan bills in Congress that would mandate increased transparency requirements for pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) in addition to potentially banning spread pricing and PBM-retained rebates.\n\nLast, CMS has announced the first ten drugs covered under Medicare Part D selected for negotiation. The negotiations with drug companies will occur in 2023 and 2024; any negotiated prices will become effective in 2026.",

        "title": "OPINION: Why artificial intelligence holds great promise for improving student outcomes - The Hechinger Report",
        "body": "The Hechinger Report is a national nonprofit newsroom that reports on one topic: education. Sign up for our weekly newsletters to get stories like this delivered directly to your inbox.\n\nThe recent rise of ChatGPT and other generative artificial intelligence tools has inspired growing anxiety on college campuses while fueling a national conversation about faculty attempts to thwart students from using the tools to cheat.\n\nBut that prevalent narrative around AI and cheating is overshadowing the technology's true potential: Artificial intelligence holds great promise for dramatically enhancing the reach and impact of postsecondary institutions and improving outcomes for all students.\n\nLast month, President Biden issued a sweeping executive order aimed at better mitigating the risks and harnessing the power of artificial intelligence, while also arguing for the need to \"shape AI's potential to transform education by creating resources to support educators deploying AI-enabled educational tools.\"\n\nBiden's call to action could not have been more timely.\n\nThe question now is not whether generative AI can positively transform educational access and attainment, but whether higher education is ready to truly democratize and personalize learning with these tools.\n\nRelated: Future of Learning: Teaching with AI, part 1\n\nAI's transformational potential is perhaps greatest at community colleges, minority-serving institutions and open-access universities. These schools' diversity necessitates a broader set of supports. Dedicated faculty and staff not only serve a very broad range of students -- including first-generation and low-income learners, returning adults, those for whom English is a second language and those balancing academic pursuits with family and work responsibilities -- but they do so with fewer resources than instructors at elite and flagship institutions. Generative AI tools can augment critically needed services such as advisers, tutors and coaches.\n\nExploring the possibilities of AI is not cheap, however. While some low-cost or free tools can make a difference, the largest impacts will be achieved through more advanced -- and costly -- tools that are developed with specific learner populations in mind and blend academic material with students' sociocultural and language contexts rather than providing generic solutions.\n\nChallenges around cost and availability could further disenfranchise the very learners who could gain the most from AI tools by denying them access to the experts, resources and development opportunities they need to benefit from them. Institutions may struggle to bring the true power of AI to bear on addressing their students' needs.\n\nSimilarly, too often, the datasets and algorithms behind AI tools reflect historical inaccuracies and intrinsic biases that only further disenfranchise learners. This will continue to be the case until we collectively confront the inequitable ways that AI systems are designed and resources are distributed.\n\nThat's why we need to think about AI differently, shifting our focus from debates about academic integrity and concerns about cheating to how we can leverage artificial intelligence in equitable ways that will boost college completion for all students.\n\nRelated: How college educators are using AI in the classroom\n\nLet's focus on how AI advances could provide all learners with the kinds of high-touch support already offered to students who attend wealthier institutions. AI tools could have a transformative effect on access, progression and completion for learners who were previously constrained by limitations of time, space and resources.\n\nImagine if generative AI tutors could provide 24/7 individualized support, along with AI-powered virtual reality tools that would widen access to experiential learning opportunities. What about having adaptive learning tools enabling students to learn at a pace that best suits their level of preparation? And personalized learning materials that reflect their backgrounds and lived experiences?\n\nSuch steps could augment engagement and outreach efforts to lower the barriers that prevent students from underserved communities from earning degrees.\n\nThis is not a speculative vision of a not-too-distant future, but an emerging reality on some campuses. Arizona State University, for example, has assembled a team of engineers and data scientists to develop AI tools to enhance learning and improve student outcomes.\n\nFor now, such experimentation is limited to colleges and universities with the resources for scaling the benefits of the technology and developing the guardrails necessary for mitigating risks to learners.\n\nRelated: OPINION: The world is changing fast. Students need data science instruction ASAP\n\nAccording to a new report from the Brookings Institution, many of the nation's most selective and affluent colleges and universities are clustered in the same coastal metro areas long home to Big Tech -- and now to AI innovation and job growth.\n\nThat's unfortunate. Access to new technology -- and the ability to play a role in shaping its design -- should not be limited by geography or institutional type. A technology that has incredible potential to help expand access to the many benefits of higher education should not become a mechanism through which inequity is exacerbated.\n\nThat's why the newly convened Complete College America Council on Equitable AI plans to bring together organizations representing over 1,000 access-focused two-year and four-year colleges and universities in January. We hope to influence and initiate policies and practices to encourage equitable engagement of AI technologies.\n\nWe hope that college leaders, policymakers and technologists will join us to make sure that AI helps to realize, rather than hinder, higher education's promise as an engine of equity, prosperity and hope.\n\nYolanda Watson Spiva is president of Complete College America.",

        "title": "Navigating Energy Challenges This Year and Beyond",
        "body": "Earlier this month, nearly 200 countries came together at the global climate conference COP28 in Dubai, UAE, agreeing to transition away from fossil fuels. At the same conference, more than 20 countries agreed to triple nuclear energy capacity by 2050, and more than 100 countries agreed to triple the world's renewable energy capacity by 2030. As countries and companies navigate an ever-changing energy landscape where ambitious clean energy targets need to be balanced with affordable and reliable transitions, it's clear collaboration will be the key to ensuring a successful clean energy transformation.\n\nAs 2023 ends, the past 12 months have highlighted the rapidly changing energy sector and that only by navigating the changing energy landscape together will we successfully tackle future challenges and opportunities. This year, we have seen growing extreme weather and climate, surging European energy costs due to the war in Ukraine, increasing inflation in the U.S. and elsewhere, and the far-reaching impact of the first year of the Inflation Reduction Act (IRA) and the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law. These and many other issues have certainly made an impact on the global energy sector and will require everyone's collective efforts. EPRI has been at the forefront of these and many other issues, and is aggressively working toward finding technology solutions that will ultimately benefit society.\n\nFor example, as the energy sector continues to decarbonize, there will be even more renewables and electrification, driving even more demands on the grid and requiring more complex planning. All this requires more complex solutions, including storage, planning, transmission, and clean technologies. Energy storage in particular will continue to play a key role as part of a reliable, resilient clean energy future. This year, EPRI, the U.S. Department of Energy, the Edison Electric Institute's Institute for the Energy Transition, and the Long Duration Energy Storage Council signed a memorandum of understanding to accelerate the commercialization of long-duration energy storage. While shorter-duration energy storage is being installed to support current renewable energy generation, long-duration storage technologies can enable grid operators to utilize stored energy to help manage seasonal fluctuations in electricity demand. Cheaper and more efficient storage can make it easier to capture and store renewable clean energy for use when energy generation is unavailable, playing an increasingly important role as part of a reliable decarbonized grid.\n\nMeantime, advanced nuclear energy and hydrogen both received a significant amount of attention this year, recognizing the potential to assist as part of the clean energy transition. In May, EPRI and the Nuclear Energy Institute jointly released an advanced reactor deployment roadmap, which outlined an achievable path for the successful deployment of advanced reactors. Among its contents, the roadmap discussed seven enablers for large-scale deployment -- and established ownership and implementation targets for 46 key actions that could help deliver advanced reactors into the market. The roadmap's first phase focused on North America, and additional phases will focus on other global regions.\n\nAs for hydrogen, this fall DOE named seven recipients of a combined $7 billion in funds from the Bipartisan Infrastructure Law to establish regional hydrogen hubs. This year, EPRI continued to collaborate with various companies on blending demonstrations, testing the technology to assist in powering natural gas-fired engines. Hydrogen has tremendous potential to help companies and countries achieve net-zero targets but needs time to be commercially viable. The shared learnings from these demonstrations will be invaluable on the road to commercialization.\n\nAdditionally, more electric vehicles (EVs) are expected on roads over the next few years. Can the grid handle the increased usage and is the EV infrastructure ready to support this increase? In August, EPRI launched a new, three-year initiative -- EVs2Scale2030™, collaborating with more than 500 stakeholders including Amazon, the U.S. Department of Energy, and leading electric companies to ready the grid in support of the accelerated development of EV charging infrastructure. Its first major deliverable has already been issued--eRoadMAP™--a free, publicly available interactive online resource that allows users to explore how quickly EVs are expected in different regions and identifies energy needs across the U.S. at the individual feeder level. The tool is intended to help electric power companies and industry stakeholders plan for the power and infrastructure needed to serve EVs.\n\nAnother issue trending this year was the increasing role of artificial intelligence (AI). As EPRI Senior Technical Executive Jeremy Renshaw testified before Congress this fall, AI provides a powerful tool for energy companies. For more than a decade, EPRI has been studying AI and its potential impacts on the energy sector, and in the last five years, the institute has accelerated its activities around AI and data science. To date, EPRI has been involved in more than 70 projects related to AI applications in the energy sector. As EPRI research found, AI can help energy companies improve efficiency of existing assets, assist with wildfire risk evaluation and early-stage detection, aid vegetation management and storm recovery, and optimize energy usage, among other benefits.\n\nThroughout the year, EPRI research continued to highlight that a successful clean energy transition will require careful planning and shared learning. A broad set of low-carbon technologies -- including hydrogen, nuclear, wind, and solar -- underpins a reliable, affordable transformation, whether in the U.S. or around the globe.\n\nAs Henry Ford said, \"Coming together is the beginning, staying together is progress, and working together is success.\" By EPRI and other key energy stakeholders collectively working together, we can have a reliable, affordable, equitable clean energy transition for all.",

        "title": "Secure cloud fabric: Enhancing data management and AI development for the federal government",
        "body": "A secure cloud fabric is a powerful tool that can help the federal government meet its evolving data management and processing needs.\n\nIn recent years, government agencies have increasingly turned to cloud computing to manage vast amounts of data and streamline operations. While cloud technology has many benefits, it also poses security risks, especially when it comes to protecting sensitive information. To address these challenges, agencies are turning to a secure cloud fabric that can ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of their data in the cloud. In addition to being a solution that can be leveraged today, it is designed to grow with an agency's cloud consumption and mission focus.\n\nCurrent challenges with cloud data\n\nThe US government generates and collects a massive amount of data each year - everything from census information to intelligence gathering. It is unclear exactly how much data is collected each year, but in a recent interview with Government Technology Insider, Scott Anderson, Federal Solutions Architect, Verizon Business Group, said the federal government can easily collect a petabyte of data within three days. While this data can be incredibly valuable for making informed decisions and protecting national security, it also presents significant challenges in terms of management and protection against cyberattacks.\n\nOne major challenge is ensuring that the data is transmitted securely between different government agencies and stakeholders. With so many parties involved in managing and analyzing government data, it's essential to have a secure, private connection that can ensure the confidentiality and integrity of the data as it's shared. However, establishing and maintaining such connections can be a complex and costly process, especially as the volume of data being transmitted continues to grow. Similarly, connecting to data lakes presents both privacy and security concerns. To prepare the data stored in these lakes for analysis and use, data scientists and analysts need protected access.\n\nSecure, private multi-cloud connectivity environment\n\nA secure cloud fabric provides secure, private multi-cloud connectivity through software-defined circuits. Anderson explained agencies aren't getting their own private cloud, but rather access to existing commercial cloud providers. That comes with the ability to create a storage infrastructure-or even create their own private cloud - that can be used going forward like a private cloud for each agency. The circuit itself can be created in less than eight hours, which allows for substantial changes to the system essentially by the end of a business day. Once established, the secure cloud fabric becomes the support infrastructure for cloud migration and cloud portability. \"Agencies can have the ability to move workloads between clouds easily, as well as having the ability to manage their Docker or Kubernetes environment in a simple structured environment. This all allows for true cloud portability,\" Anderson said.\n\nWith a secure cloud fabric, government agencies can create a non-bifurcated infrastructure that allows for a secure, private connection between their different cloud environments, regardless of whether they are hosted on public or private clouds. This means that data can be transferred between different cloud environments without having to go through the public internet, which is vulnerable to bad actors. A secure cloud fabric allows for agencies to connect to other federal agencies that can connect to other state agencies, as well as connecting to various commercial partners easily and effectively within the system.\n\nSupport for data lake connectivity\n\nIn addition to creating a secure, private multi-cloud connectivity environment, agencies also benefit from the ability to connect easily and securely to data lakes. Data lakes store raw data that can be used for various purposes, mostly focused on analytics, machine learning, and data visualization. Using a secure cloud fabric to connect to a data lake offers agencies the advantages of maintaining control over their data while leveraging cloud-based storage's scalability and cost-effectiveness. This is especially important for government agencies, which often have strict security and privacy requirements that need to be met when handling sensitive information.\n\nA secure cloud fabric can also help government agencies to optimize their data management practices by enabling them to easily move data between different cloud environments, regardless of whether they are hosted on public or private clouds. This can help agencies to take advantage of the unique capabilities of different cloud providers, while still maintaining a unified view of their data. With these capabilities, they are able to create massive data lakes and ingest data sources from many different sources.\n\nSupport for future AI development\n\nSecretary of State Antony J. Blinken recently stated, \"A global technology revolution is now underway. The world's leading powers are racing to develop and deploy new technologies like artificial intelligence and quantum computing that could shape everything about our lives - from where we get energy, to how we do our jobs, to how wars are fought. We want America to maintain our scientific and technological edge, because it's critical to us thriving in the 21st century economy.\" It's imperative that the US government keep pace, if not lead the charge on the investment in and advancement of AI to maintain its global influence. Government agencies are implementing AI to enhance customer experiences, optimize workloads, and fulfill their missions. Along with all its other uses, a secure cloud fabric infrastructure can be built out to support AI.\n\n\"If you think about artificial intelligence, it's applying structural intelligence to data collected by the federal government,\" Anderson said. It's already been established that the government collects an incredible amount of data. With a secure cloud fabric, agencies can build a framework to deploy and augment their future AI infrastructure.\n\nConclusion\n\nA secure cloud fabric is a powerful tool that can help the federal government meet its evolving data management and processing needs. It provides a secure and private multi-cloud connection that supports both data lakes and AI infrastructure. By leveraging this technology, government agencies can unlock the full potential of cloud-based resources, while still maintaining the security, privacy, and compliance requirements that are essential to their mission. Because of this, secure cloud fabric is likely to play an increasingly important role in the federal government's digital transformation efforts in the years to come.",

The ratio had tightened to eight-to-one by 1960, and reached five-to-one in 1980 due to the passage of civil rights legislation in the 1960s, including the Civil Rights Act of 1964, the Voting Rights Act of 1965, the Fair Housing Act of 1968 and changes to the federal minimum wage set under the Fair Labor Standards Act. However, since 1980, the racial wealth gap has increased by about 0.1% a year due to a difference in capital gains -- or previously owned wealth and the interest earned on that wealth -- the Federal Reserve found. The unemployment rate for Black Americans is also twice as high as it is for white workers, according to a 2017 study from the Center for Economic and Policy Research.\n\nWhy The Racial Wealth Gap Hasn't Shrunk Since MLK's Death: A Look At The Numbers (Forbes)",

        "body": "Roughly one year after ChatGPT's oxygen-sucking public debut, the retail and consumer goods industry is grappling with a host of evolving challenges in the use, adoption, and scaling of artificial intelligence. While AI isn't new, the thrust of generative AI into the hands of just about anyone changed the game.\n\nTech leaders and practitioners across myriad industries gathered in New York last week for the annual AI Summit to share experiences, best practices, cautionary tales, and more. Among the takeaways for business leaders:\n\nDon't waste your time with mere lip service when it comes to the ethical considerations for responsible AI. From a business standpoint, sustainable success hinges upon it: Skip obtaining buy-in at all levels and kiss your scalable dreams goodbye.\n\nToday's companies require constructs that will lead to trustworthy AI, stressed Inderpal Bhandari, Walgreens Boots Alliance board of directors member and the former global chief data officer of IBM. This includes not just ethics and governance boards but also a slew of mechanisms to monitor, measure, and audit aspects like fairness and transparency.\n\nEngage with your peers and learn more about Building the Future of Unified Intelligence at Analytics Unite, held May 1-3 in Chicago. Register here.\n\nThere are also considerations surrounding the environmental impact for some generative AI tools, said Taha Mokfi, associate director of data science at HelloFresh. \"You don't want to spin up the GPU to ask what is the capital of the U.S. That's really costly as opposed to searching on Google, which is much less.\"\n\nThese are both top-down and bottom-up mandates -- lacking trust from senior leadership means poor resource allocation, while lacking trust from the rank-and-file promises poor adoption rates.\n\n\"If they're concerned about losing their job -- if they're concerned about AI essentially picking up the knowledge they have, encapsulating that in software, and then it being shipped out to some vendor -- it's not going to happen,\" Bhandari noted.",

        "title": "GinsGlobal Index Fund Managing Director sees strong tailwinds for Cloud and Tech ETF's",
        "body": "Anthony Ginsberg, CEO of GINSGLOBAL Index Fund joined Steve Darling from Proactive to an overview of the performance and trends in its Cloud Technology ETF and the Tech Megatrend ETF for 2023. For the Cloud Technology ETF, Ginsburg highlights a strong year with returns exceeding 41%. He attributes this success to the growth of artificial intelligence (AI), which is driving increased spending on cloud services. Cloud providers like Microsoft and Google are integrating AI chips into their platforms, making them major beneficiaries of this trend. The continued prevalence of remote work has also led to substantial mergers and acquisitions in the cybersecurity sector linked to cloud services. Turning to the Tech Megatrend ETF, Ginsburg notes that it has seen a robust performance, nearly reaching a 40% increase.\n\nLower interest rate forecasts and the Federal Reserve's pause have favored growth stocks. The integration of AI and digital technologies across various industries has been a significant driver of growth. Ginsburg highlights Microsoft's acquisition of Activision for $75 billion as an example of the convergence of social media, cloud, and digital gaming, all powered by AI. The gaming industry has surpassed Hollywood in size, driven by AI advancements and mobile device gaming. Looking ahead to 2024, Ginsburg expects the growth in these sectors to continue. Cloud spending is projected to increase by nearly $1 trillion by 2028, with AI-related expenditures reaching around $2 trillion by the end of the decade.\n\nThis growth will benefit both major cloud providers and mid-cap and large-cap companies. Ginsburg emphasizes that we are in the midst of the Fourth Industrial Revolution, with AI and the outsourcing of data processing playing a central role, and cloud technology positioned to facilitate this transformation. In conclusion, Ginsburg anticipates further growth and exciting opportunities for both cloud technology and the broader tech megatrend in 2024. These trends underscore the importance of AI and digital integration across industries and promise a dynamic year ahead in the world of technology investments.",

        "title": "Bill Gates' predictions for 2024: fewer undernourished kids, more AI",
        "body": "Issuing his annual predictions for the year to come Tuesday, Bill Gates said 2024 will be a \"turning point.\"\n\nGates, the billionaire co-founder of Microsoft, said in the 10-page letter that he expects to see more innovations in artificial intelligence, a breakthrough in infant malnutrition, advances in climate change talks and defining elections around the world.\n\nAhead of 2023, Gates projected the world could recover lost ground on polio eradication, AI-powered ultrasounds could help save mothers and their babies, gene therapy could help treat AIDS and better buildings would combat climate change.\n\nWith a $118.5 billion net worth, according to Forbes, Gates is the seventh richest person on the planet. As former Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos settles in Miami, a move he announced last month, Gates will become the richest person in Washington.\n\nGates and ex-wife, Melinda French Gates, have donated billions of dollars to a variety of causes through the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation. Last year, he announced he would give away virtually his entire fortune through the foundation. \"I will move down and eventually off of the list of the world's richest people,\" he said in a post on X, formerly known as Twitter.\n\nTrending nowLoading... Artificial intelligence\n\nGates' forecast on AI goes beyond last year's ultrasound prediction, asserting that AI progress will broadly improve global health while enabling innovation in developed and developing countries.\n\n\"Artificial intelligence is about to accelerate the rate of new discoveries at a pace we've never seen before,\" Gates wrote.\n\nAI could help communities around the world with combating antibiotic resistant diseases, helping non-English speakers manage high-risk pregnancies and making medical information easier to access for health workers.\n\nStill, he said, \"there is a long road ahead for projects like these.\" Hurdles include scaling the technology without sacrificing quality and ensuring functionality over time.\n\n\"If we make smart investments now, AI can make the world a more equitable place,\" Gates wrote.\n\nGet Clark County news and more delivered straight to your inbox. Sign up for our newsletters today.Sign up\n\nWhile no longer CEO, Gates remains an adviser at Microsoft. This year, the tech giant moved aggressively to incorporate generative AI into its products, including the search engine Bing and browser Edge through a partnership with ChatGPT-maker OpenAI.\n\nGates predicts the general population in high-income countries is between 18 to 24 months away from wide AI use. Elsewhere, Gates expects that number to be three years.\n\nGlobal health advancements\n\nThe world is near a breakthrough in using gut microbiome supplements to address malnutrition in children, according to Gates.\n\n\"Feeding infants this probiotic helps them move their microbiome into that positive state so they can grow up and achieve their full potential,\" Gates wrote. \"The next step is (hopefully) broader regulatory approval and scaled-up, high quality, and reliable manufacturing.\"\n\nNutritionists can also look toward developing a probiotic supplement for mothers while the child is still in the womb, he continued.\n\nNuclear energy\n\nAccording to Gates, climate change conversations are advancing as more people experience extreme weather.\n\nA lot of the climate change discussions surround clean energy, which increasingly includes nuclear power, said Gates, a longtime backer of nuclear energy.\n\n\"In 2024 and beyond, I predict we will see lots of new innovations coming into the marketplace -- even in very complicated areas like nuclear,\" Gates wrote.\n\nThat is good news for TerraPower, the nuclear energy company he founded in 2008. TerraPower's first plant in Wyoming, which will potentially open in 2030, \"will be the most advanced nuclear facility in the world,\" he said.\n\nAt the COP28 climate change conference in Dubai this year, which Gates attended, he said he was optimistic about the future, based on the rising number of climate technology startups present there compared to eight years ago at the Paris conference.\n\nOverall, Gates wrote, he is optimistic. This decade will be key for upgrading electric grids and improving power transmission to realize the full potential of clean energy, he said. But he added the world still needs to figure out how to get to zero emissions.\n\nElections around the globe\n\nIn 2024, countries that house more than half of the world's population will hold elections, Gates said. Those countries include the United States, India, Indonesia and South Africa.\n\nThe results of the elections will \"shape the future of global health and the climate,\" according to Gates.\n\n\"If I could make one wish for all the people headed to the polls next year -- no matter where they live -- it would be for them to consider elected leaders who understand the importance of investing in human development around the world,\" Gates wrote.\n\nGates listed the United States President's Emergency Plan for AIDS Relief launched in 2003 by then-President George W. Bush as one of the models of a program that governments should support.\n\nNowadays, climate change is a challenge that needs global attention and support, he added. He also warned the world is not ready for another pandemic similar to COVID-19.\n\n\"I believe the 2024 elections will be a turning point for both health and climate,\" Gates wrote.\n\nMicrosoft Philanthropies and the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation underwrite some Seattle Times journalism projects.",

        "body": "Beyond the more well-known recent AI developments of the past year and their associated models, there are other, less known, but very interesting and profound projects being done in artificial intelligence.\n\nOne such fascinating project is Meta's CICERO, which could have an extremely beneficial impact if its core competency (diplomacy) is understood and appreciated.\n\nCICERO represents a significant advancement in AI, being the first to achieve human-level performance in the strategy game Diplomacy through its ability to negotiate, persuade, and cooperate effectively with human players.\n\nGames like chess, Go, and poker have previously been used as platforms for AI development, but CICERO advances beyond mere strategic gameplay to mastering negotiation and persuasion.\n\nIn Diplomacy, a game requiring understanding of human motivations and strategic communication, CICERO ranked in the top 10% of players on webDiplomacy.net, demonstrating its proficiency in human-like negotiation.\n\nUnlike deterministic games like Chess and Go, Diplomacy requires understanding of human behaviors and intentions, making it a more complex challenge for AI development.\n\nCICERO combines strategic reasoning and natural language processing, enabling it to plan and communicate effectively with human players, understanding their perspectives and intentions.\n\nThis development paves the way for more sophisticated human-AI interactions, with potential applications in various fields where natural language and strategic reasoning are crucial.\n\nThe insights gained from a deep understanding of the art of diplomacy, is that it is most successful when everyone benefits, and that trust is the currency of collaboration. CICERO could be used as a strategic partner in creating more beneficial and long-lasting negotiations where \"win-win\" is the ultimate result.\n\nI encourage you to watch the video (the link is below the image) and then follow the second link to Meta's CICERO page, which goes into more detail about the project.\n\nDiplomacy is not only a powerful tool for the geo-political domain but also the business and personal domains as well.\n\nLink to CICERO's Meta page\n\nI hope you have enjoyed this article and found it useful. If you made it down to the bottom here, please like and follow. It helps get me motivated to do more articles like these. Thanks!\n\n#artificialintelligence, #ai, #generativeai, #cicero",

        "body": "Generative artificial intelligence (AI) dominated the retail technology landscape in 2023 and is poised to continue doing so in 2024.\n\nBased on machine learning (ML), generative AI can create new content and ideas, including conversations, stories, images, videos, and music. The November 2022 public debut of the ChatGPT AI platform, which interacts with users in a conversational style that mimics human interaction and uses ML to continually refine and improve its responses, marked the arrival of leading-edge generative AI as a mainstream retail solution.\n\nSince then, generative AI has rapidly built momentum in retail that should only accelerate in 2023. Here are three retail enterprise workflows the leading-edge technology shows particular promise to transform.\n\nCustomer engagement\n\nGenerative AI first came to prominence in retail as a sophisticated engine for supporting human-like chatbot interactions, and certainly many retail organizations deployed the technology in chatbot solutions.\n\nOne example is Instacart, which offers Ask Instacart, an AI-based chatbot that utilizes the ChatGPI API, as well as its own AI models and proprietary catalog data, to provide customers with product recommendations that are intuitively organized, as well as additional relevant information about food preparation, product attributes, and dietary considerations.\n\nBut generative AI-based customer engagement tools range well beyond chatbots. Online consumer electronics retailer Newegg introduced generative AI customer solutions throughout the year, including a number of chatbots as well automated summaries of customer reviews and automated accuracy checks of product descriptions.\n\nIn addition, eBay provides generative AI-based features that enable sellers to add in a title and category for a listing, with the rest of the listing automatically filled in; as well as to take or upload a photo in the eBay app and have generative AI fill in item information details, including titles and descriptions.\n\nProprietary technology development\n\nAmazon and Walmart are both actively developing their own in-house generative AI platforms. Amazon Web Services (AWS), the cloud services platform of Amazon, offers generative AI model called Bedrock, and is in a strategic collaboration with San Francisco-based generative AI developer Anthropic that includes investing up to $4 billion in the company and holding a minority ownership position.\n\nMeanwhile, Walmart offers employees the Walmart GenAI Playground, an early-stage internal tool where they can explore and learn about the technology. The discounter also includes a generative AI assistant in a new employee app.\n\nWalmart is additionally developing generative AI tools to assist customers with search and complex purchases, researching how the technology can aid consumer decision-making, and experimenting with a tool that would integrate the technology into its recently upgraded augmented reality (AR)-based View in Your Home feature and virtual try-on solutions.\n\nEmployee augmentation\n\nDirect-to-consumer intimate apparel retailer Adore Me is testing Duet AI for Google Workspace, which embeds generative AI across Google communication and collaboration apps including Gmail, Calendar, Drive, Docs and Meet, with employees.\n\nAs a result, Adore Me hopes to reduce manual workload on its employees and provide corporate teams with more time to focus on creativity and innovation.",

        "title": "HHS finalizes significant changes to the ONC Health IT Certification Program focusing on AI transparency and interoperability",
        "body": "On December 13, 2023, the US Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), via the Office of the National Coordinator for Health Information Technology (ONC), finalized the Health Data, Technology, and Interoperability: Certification Program Updates, Algorithm Transparency, and Information Sharing (HTI-1)rule. The final rule builds on the proposed HTI-1 rule released in April 2023, which attracted significant public comment.\n\nAlong with new interoperability and enhanced information blocking requirements, the HTI-1 final rule establishes groundbreaking transparency requirements for artificial intelligence (AI) and other predictive algorithms in certified health IT. The algorithmic transparency requirements specify the provision of baseline algorithm information, designed to allow clinical users to evaluate algorithm fairness, appropriateness, validity, effectiveness and safety (FAVES). ONC is eager to adopt this approach, promoting responsible AI in ONC-certified health IT - IT which ONC reports supports care delivery by more than 96 percent of hospitals and 78 percent of office-based physicians in the US.\n\nGiven the growing importance and promise of AI in healthcare, this alert focuses on summarizing the new algorithmic transparency requirements for certified health IT included within the 916-page final rule.\n\nHTI-1 rule and algorithm transparency\n\nThe HTI-1 final rule implements statutory[1] provisions and Executive Order[2] directives, designed to advance interoperability, health equity, and transparency in health system IT. The final rule makes numerous updates to the ONC Health IT Certification Program, a program which includes various standards, implementation specifications, and certification criteria for health IT developers and health IT modules. As such, the changes will be of great interest to IT developers who have certified a health IT module under the ONC Health IT Certification Program.[3]\n\nNotably, the final rule does not apply to healthcare providers (ie, health systems) that self-develop health IT not offered to others.\n\nWhile many of the finalized rule's provisions reflect a steady evolution of the Health IT Certification Program, the decision support intervention (DSI) provisions, setting out algorithm transparency requirements, are a significant regulatory development. Developers of certified health IT will be required to comply with the DSI requirements by the end of 2024.\n\nThe algorithm requirements in the finalized rule only apply to certified health IT (as opposed to software used in healthcare more generally), but, even with this tailored scope, a broad patient population will be impacted by these changes.\n\nDSI certification criterion\n\nThe final HTI-1 rule adopts a DSI certification criterion as a revised version of the clinical decision support (CDS) certification criterion. This includes establishing a new definition for Predictive DSIs (namely \"technology that supports decision-making based on algorithms or models that derive relationships from training data and then produce an output that results in prediction, classification, recommendation, evaluation, or analysis,\" which notably is not tied to technology risk level or intended use) and expanding the set of required source attributes (categories of technical performance and quality information) in connection with evidence-based and Predictive DSIs.\n\nKey requirements include:\n\nThe finalized rule does not include requirements for how to present source attribute information to users, other than mandating the availability of complete and up-to-date plain language descriptions of source attribution information.\n\nThe proposed rule suggested that certified health IT modules enable a user to review source attribute information \"at a minimum via direct display, drill down or link out\" from a health IT module. This language does not appear in the final rule, in consideration of comments stating that including too much information in the direct display can negatively impact usability, user adoption, and could unintentionally inhibit innovative user interfaces. The finalized rule does, however, require that certified health IT modules must enable a limited set of identified users to access, record, and change source attribute information for DSIs.\n\nOther notable updates\n\nThe final rule revises certain information blocking definitions and exceptions and adds a new exception to encourage secure, efficient, standards-based exchange of electronic health information under the Trusted Exchange Framework and Common Agreement℠ (TEFCA).\n\nIn addition, the final rule adopts the United States Core Data for Interoperability (USCDI) Version 3 as the new baseline standard within the ONC Health IT Certification Program as of January 1, 2026.\n\nFurther, the final rule implements provisions of the 21 Century Cures Act's requirement to adopt a condition of certification for developers of certified health IT to report certain metrics as part of their participation in the Certification Program. Referred to as the \"Insights Condition,\" these metrics are intended to provide greater insight into how certified health IT is used in support of healthcare delivery.\n\nImpact on health IT developers and healthcare providers\n\nThese requirements are not only important for certified health IT developers to understand and implement. Under the final rule, the DSI certification criterion will become the criterion required for healthcare providers with health IT that meets the Base Electronic Health Record (EHR) definition. This is significant for providers who intend to use Certified EHR Technology for the purposes of participating in certain Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services programs.\n\nWhile the final rule spaces out many of the new requirements over one, two, three, and four years to allow developers and the industry to implement changes over time, algorithmic transparency was identified as a key priority, and, accordingly, the DSI provisions have a one-year compliance mandate. Developers of AI/ML tools used within certified health IT will need to be aware of the DSI requirements and the one-year timeline for compliance.\n\nAdditional resources\n\nThe full text of the HTI-1 final rule and accompanying fact sheets are posted here, and ONC will host information sessions on the final rule in the new year.",

        "title": "The 10 Billionaires Who Gained The Most Wealth In 2023",
        "body": "or many of the ultra-rich, 2023 was a year of getting ultra-richer. With stock markets around the world rallying, more than half the planet's 2,568 billionaires are wealthier than they were on New Year's Day -- some to the tune of billions, tens of billions and even, for one lucky X man, more than $100 billion.\n\nOf course, some billionaires are more fortunate than others. The year's ten biggest gainers added a combined $490 billion to their wealth, through December 15, 2023, according to Forbes' estimates.\n\nSeven of the ten are technology billionaires. If 2022 was a year of reckoning for big tech, 2023 was a year of rebound, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq Composite jumping by 42%, nearly doubling the broader S&P 500's 23% rise. And shares of the \"magnificent seven\" -- Apple, Microsoft, Alphabet, Amazon, Nvidia, Tesla and Meta -- all far outpaced the market, helping propel the billionaires behind them to even greater wealth.\n\nNo one got richer this year, in sheer dollar terms, than Elon Musk (who Forbes categorizes as an automotive billionaire because most of his wealth comes from carmaker Tesla). Musk began 2023 as the world's second richest person, worth an estimated $146.5 billion after losing more money in 2022 than anyone else. He ends the year back on top, having added more than $108 billion to his net worth amid a remarkable U-turn in Tesla stock.\n\nJust two of this year's ten top gainers hail from outside the U.S.: Indonesia's petrochemicals and energy tycoon Prajogo Pangestu, the year's largest gainer in percentage terms (at more than 900%), and the Spanish mogul behind fashion retailer Zara, Amancio Ortega.\n\nMusk spent his first full year in charge of Twitter, which he renamed X in July, mostly lighting his investment on fire one controversial tweet at a time. Yet Musk still managed to get richer than anyone else in the world over the past 12 months, thanks largely to two of his other ventures. Shares of his electric carmaker Tesla, which began delivering Cybertrucks last month, are up more than 100%. And his rocket business SpaceX, which has carried out more than 90 successful launches this year, skyrocketed to a valuation of $150 billion this July, and is now said to be in the process of selling shares at a $180 billion valuation.\n\nAfter an especially rough 2022 -- with a collapsing share price, crumbling profits and significant fourth-quarter layoffs -- Zuck has come roaring back, adding some $75 billion in wealth as stockholders have cheered his \"year of efficiency.\" Shares of Facebook parent company Meta are up 178% through December 15, on pace for their best year ever.\n\nBezos gave away stock worth $700 million, mainly to combat homelessness and climate change, and pledged $100 million to wildfire relief relief in Maui, where he has a home. Bezos can afford such gifts and more: Amazon stock is up 79% in 2023, giving Bezos -- who also took possession of a new super yacht and got engaged to former TV anchor Lauren Sanchez this year -- nearly $65 billion new reasons to celebrate.\n\nThe Indonesian mogul amassed a fortune in timber and petrochemicals. He took a coal mining business public in March and, in October, listed on the Indonesian Stock Exchange a renewable energy company that owns the country's largest geothermal producer; shares have since jumped by more than 200%.\n\nStock in Google parent company Alphabet are up 50% this year, as investors await the tech giant's Gemini AI software in 2024. Alphabet, which Page cofounded with Sergey Brin in 1998, launched AI chatbot Bard in March.\n\nShares of the Spanish fast-fashion pioneer's Madrid-listed Inditex, known for its Zara stores, have risen 57% in 2023, to record highs, amid strong demand and record profits. Good news for Ortega, who owns around 60% of the company and sits on its board alongside daughter Marta Ortega Perez, who has been non-executive chair since 2022.\n\nBrin, who along with Page stepped back from Google's daily operations in 2019, returned to the company in his most hands-on role in years in 2023, working on the business' AI efforts.\n\nIt was a good year for Ballmer's two major investments, the Los Angeles Clippers NBA team -- which is worth 19% more than a year ago -- and Microsoft -- where Ballmer, who was CEO from 2000 to 2014, remains a shareholder. The stock is up 55%, largely thanks to Microsoft's lucrative, $10 billion investment in Chat GPT-developer OpenAI.\n\nGenerative AI-driven demand for data center services has helped push up shares of Oracle, the software giant Ellison cofounded in 1977, by 26% this year. That's made Ellison, who's Oracle's chief technology officer, more than $30 billion richer, even after a recent selloff.\n\nNo one embodies the AI boom better than Huang, the cofounder and CEO of Nvidia, which designs more of the chips used for artificial intelligence systems than anyone. The stock has rocketed by more than 230% in 2023, pushing Nvidia's market capitalization to $1.2 trillion and making Taiwan-born Huang -- who has the company logo tattooed on his arm -- one of the 20 richest Americans.",

ADTH, a machine-learning pioneer and industry leader using privacy-forward solutions to deliver measurable value for programmatic advertisers, today announced the results from a study with Advertiser Perceptions, the leading provider of research-based strategic market intelligence to the media, advertising, and ad tech industries.

        "body": "Agree Realty is a dividend play that can pay its own way while you go for it in AI stocks, too.\n\nStocks in companies that are part and parcel of the artificial intelligence (AI) revolution attract intense investor attention, as they should.\n\nThey include both the generationally successful blue chip technology companies like Alphabet and upstarts like C3.ai that may or may not prove to be on the same long-term trajectory.\n\nCertainly, do not ignore the investment treasure that potentially lies among the growing pantheon of AI players. These are companies at the forefront of innovations that can profitably disrupt existing industries while creating new markets, and that could well be the case for years to come.\n\nIn the meantime, don't get so caught up as to neglect the enduring value of diversification as an insurance policy against the vagaries of a high-flying market sector. (Remember the dot-com implosion a mere 20 years ago?)\n\nKeeping some cash in proven dividend stocks is a great way to diversify and buttress your portfolio. These companies tend to be in mature industries with established business models, and predictable cash flows both to their own coffers and to yours.\n\nThe effect is cumulative and enduring. According to a new study by Hartford Funds, reinvested dividends -- through the magic of compounding -- have accounted for 69% of the total return of the S&P 500 index since 1960.\n\nWhile it hasn't been around that long, a good stock to consider for this part of your investing strategy is Agree Realty (ADC 1.42%), a real estate investment trust (REIT) that, since going public in 1994, has produced an average annual total return of 11.3%. In the past 10 years, Agree has posted an annualized dividend growth of 5.9%, powering its total return past that of the big index over that time, as the chart below shows.\n\nAs a REIT, Agree Realty is obligated by tax law to return at least 90% of its taxable income each year to shareholders in the form of dividends. This suburban Detroit firm does so comfortably with a growing portfolio that currently comprises about 2,100 properties in 49 states.\n\nOne of the industry's leading retail REITs, Agree has diversity within its own holdings, with nearly 70% of its rent coming from investment-grade tenants led by Walmart at 6.2% of the rent roll but no other retailer accounting for more than 5%. By industry, grocery and home improvement stores account for 9.7% and 8.6% of the rent roll, respectively, Agree said in its third-quarter earnings report.\n\nAgree pays out monthly, making it perhaps a bit more agreeable to passive-income investors, and it currently is yielding about 4.9% at a share price of about $61. Analysts give it a consensus target price of $67.69, an upside of about 10% that adds to its attractiveness and stability.\n\nDividend stocks like Agree Realty and more volatile issues from AI start-ups both have their place in a balanced portfolio. That mix is highly individual, depending on such factors as your desire for investment income, timeline to retirement, and tolerance risk.\n\nWhile it's probably more assurance than insurance, investing in a proven performer like Agree Realty can help provide some confidence around your portfolio's overall performance while you probe the market for big scores in the explosive, emerging sector of AI investing.",

        "body": "Welcome to Part 8 of our Decoding AI: A government perspective learning series! In our previous blog, we re-introduced a technique that can help us achieve better boundary conditions and quality outputs: Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with GAI. In this module, we wrap up with a culmination of all our learnings till date, and how they can benefit the US government and the public. We will also share some of the best practices and tips for using generative AI, and how to avoid or mitigate some of the potential risks or challenges. -- Kent Cunningham, Miri Rodriguez, Siddhartha Chaturvedi\n\nWhy generative AI matters for the US Government\n\nGenerative AI, particularly in its applications through platforms like Azure Open AI and Copilot, stands at the forefront of innovation in artificial intelligence, offering transformative possibilities for federal civilian agencies. Its capacity to enhance various government functions extends beyond the realms of proposal management and content creation. For instance, in the realm of public service, generative AI can revolutionize how agencies interact with citizens, offering more streamlined and efficient access to benefits and services. It can profoundly improve call center operations, not only in terms of efficiency but also by elevating customer satisfaction through more responsive and personalized support.\n\nThe application of generative AI in automating and refining the processes of drafting proposals, reports, and official documents is another area where its impact is deeply felt. By employing advanced natural language generation and summarization techniques, these AI tools can significantly reduce the time and resources spent on document creation, allowing agencies to focus more on strategic decision-making and mission-critical tasks. Additionally, generative AI can aid in data analysis and decision-making processes, providing insights and recommendations that are based on comprehensive data evaluation, thus enabling better-informed decision-making and program delivery.\n\nHowever, the deployment of AI and Large Language Models in government sectors brings with it the imperative of adhering to stringent standards of data privacy, ethics, and quality. In the context of government operations, where data sensitivity and accuracy are paramount, it's essential to ensure that the use of generative AI aligns with these principles. To this end, federal agencies must adopt a responsible and trustworthy approach towards the application of generative AI. This involves embracing robust data governance practices and frameworks, ensuring that the technology is not only effective and efficient in enhancing mission delivery but also compliant with the highest standards of data integrity and ethical considerations. In doing so, agencies can leverage the full potential of generative AI while maintaining public trust and ensuring the safeguarding of sensitive information.\n\nYour data governance practices are crucial to set clear limits and safeguards, and use generative AI with your data in a responsible and efficient way.\n\nHow to use generative AI responsibly and effectively\n\nIn this learning series, we have covered some of the key concepts and techniques that can help government agencies to use generative AI responsibly and effectively, such as:\n\nEverything starts with Data\n\nAs we have discussed previously, generative AI is often at its most effective when it's firmly rooted in reliable and trustworthy organizational data, finely tuned to deliver optimal results for specific outcomes. We can think of generative AI not as an entirely new technology, but more like a highly adaptable version of an existing tool that, when properly nurtured, becomes an integral part of the business fabric. As always was true in the past, this new adaptation and integration process involves a blend of critical data governance and grounding in relevant data to be most effective.\n\nStrong data governance is the bedrock of this process. Just as a new puppy in your home needs the right care and environment to thrive, generative AI requires high-quality, well-governed data to function effectively. It's not just about feeding it any data; it's about feeding it the right data. This is where the traditional data governance practices which have been in place for many years really begin to shine; by ensuring that the data used is not only accurate and reliable but also ethically sourced and compliant with applicable regulations. Without this critical foundation which has always been in place for enterprise ready applications, the potential of generative AI (or any AI/ML) in mission-critical settings can be severely compromised.\n\nNow, let's talk about tuning and grounding. Generative AI, when grounded in an organization's specific (and well governed) data, becomes more than a general-purpose tool; it transforms into a customized solution that knows the facts and terminology of your organization. By tuning it to the nuances of the organization's data and desired outcomes, generative AI becomes more aligned with the business goals, yielding more relevant and impactful results. This tuning is about making the AI system responsive to the unique demands and context of the business.\n\nMeta-prompting is another key aspect. It's about guiding the generative AI with precise instructions, ensuring it generates content that's not just creative but also aligned with specific business objectives. Much like how you would give specific commands to a pet to elicit certain behaviors, meta-prompting in generative AI steers the creative process in a direction that's beneficial for the organization as it builds responses from the accessible data.\n\nIn a nutshell, generative AI in a mission-critical setting is a symphony of well-governed data, tuning, relevant grounding on that data, and strategic meta-prompting. It's a technology that, with the right care and guidance - much like nurturing a new pet - can bring about transformative results. All of this starts with the well-managed data governance practices have long been the driving force behind successful mission applications. These time-tested practices form the cornerstone upon which the efficacy of AI, including generative AI, is built. Maintaining and enhancing these traditional data governance methodologies remains crucial in unlocking the full potential of AI technologies across the organization as well.\n\nThe future of generative AI for the US Government\n\nGenerative AI is not a futuristic or hypothetical technology, but rather a present and practical one, that can help the US government to achieve its mission and vision, and to serve the public better and faster. Generative AI is not a replacement or a threat, but rather a complement and a partner, that can augment the human capabilities and enhance the human outcomes. Generative AI is not a black box or a magic wand, but rather a complex and dynamic system, that requires careful design, implementation, monitoring, and evaluation.\n\nWe hope that this learning series has helped you to understand the basics and the benefits of generative AI, and to get started with your own generative AI projects and experiments. The possibilities and opportunities of generative AI are vast, but it is important to use it responsibly and effectively for the US government and the public.\n\nHere below, we've provided links to the earlier modules in this learning series, however, we encourage you to sign up here to stay up to date on the latest news and announcements on AI for the US Government.",

        "title": "Use Technology to Support Your Clinicians",
        "body": "Health system and hospital CMOs are adopting a range of technology solutions to support clinicians.\n\nThey're focused on technology aimed at clinical documentation and other administrative burdens, which have been linked to clinician burnout and clinician dissatisfaction.\n\n\"Technology can help clinicians be more efficient, more compliant, and more integrated in our documentation, which allows us to provide coordinated care for our patients,\" says Carolyn Kloek, MD, chief medical officer of OU Health in Oklahoma. \"Technology can become a huge enabler to allow doctors to put patients as the primary focus in their care and not always thinking about the documentation with half of their minds.\"\n\n\"When you are talking about documentation and technology, it is essential for patient quality and safety, which is a key part of what I do as chief medical officer,\" she says. \"I also see technology as a way to help clinicians do their work more effectively and more efficiently. Technology can decrease clinician burnout and help clinicians to take better care of patients.\"\n\nTechnology is an intractable part of the modern care delivery model and needs to be on the CMO's agenda, says Benjamin Mansalis, MD, senior vice president and chief digital and information officer, at IU Health in Indiana.\n\n\"Technology can be both an enabler and a source of friction,\" he adds. \"A CMO who engages deeply in working with their technology partners will help shift the balance toward enablement and accelerate the value to both patients and caregivers.\"\n\nOU Health recently implemented Epic as the health system's integrated electronic health record, Kloek says. That will be the base on which many new technologies and tools will be built.\n\n\"We are looking at AI and the clinical intelligence around automated documentation,\" she says. \"There is also clinical decision support in AI that you can lay on top of your electronic medical record. There are algorithms that can help clinicians more efficiently interpret the EMR. These algorithms can present the more pertinent information -- they can cull through the EMR and present information to the clinicians.\"\n\nOU Health is putting building blocks in place to prepare for adoption of AI technology that will be designed to support clinicians, she says. They include Dragon and Nuance, which are specific to the idea of ambient clinical intelligence, which focuses on taking speech and turning it into electronic text.\n\n\"We have leaned into that aspect of Epic,\" Kloek says.\n\nCMOs should be focused on technology that reduces documentation burdens on clinicians, Mansalis says.\n\n\"We have seen that technology has become more and more a part of the delivery of healthcare as we create documentation for necessary reasons for healthcare claims for the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services and commercial payers,\" he says. \"Creating a record of the healthcare interaction has become an important part of our billing and payment cycles. The art of medicine and the time and space that clinicians need to create therapeutic relationships has been at odds with the need to create documentation of what happens between a patient and a clinician.\"\n\nTechnology that supports documentation is a key component of establishing a therapeutic relationship by removing the burden on clinicians as much as possible. This includes leveraging generative artificial intelligence and large language models, which are particularly good at summarizing and creating clinical documentation that meets the requirements for payments and billing, Mansalis says.\n\n\"We are seeing a lot of advancements,\" he says. \"We went from scribes in the exam room typing what the doctor says to create a note to leveraging generative AI models that create the note. A human checks the AI model notes for quality assurance. Now, we have fully automated solutions that provide documentation support for clinicians, so they can focus on the most important aspect of their work, which is creating a therapeutic relationship with their patients.\"\n\nIU Health has made improving the EMR to make it more user friendly for clinicians a top priority, Mansalis says. As part of this effort, the health system has invested $50 million in digital transformation technology.\n\nIn 2024, IU Health will be expanding a SWAT team program, consisting of a small group of analysts and chief medical information officers, to focus on the health system's Cerner electronic health record.\n\n\"The SWAT team will go to ambulatory primary care sites and hospital units,\" Mansalis says. \"They will ... talk with the physicians, nurses, frontline registration staff, and other care team members about the utilization of our Cerner electronic health record. They will coach ... optimal use of the technology ... [and] ask clinicians and other care team members about what they would like to see changed in the EHR to make it work better for them and their patients. We will take that information and use it to make modifications to make the EHR work better for the care teams.\"\n\nAn example of how the SWAT team has already improved the EHR can be found at the Riley Hospital for Children's Pediatric Intensive Care Unit. The SWAT team noticed that it was hard for clinicians and nurses to quickly identify when a PICU patient was deteriorating. They noted that important information contained in the monitoring equipment, such as data on arterial lines and ventilators, wasn't getting to the clinicians and the nurses through the EHR.\n\n\"We worked with a company to integrate information in the PICU's monitoring equipment using a tool to capture the monitor information at a high level of granularity,\" Mansalis says. \"The tool runs a machine learning model on the information to determine whether the patient is getting better or the patient is getting worse based on about 20 parameters. It allows nurses to triage patients more effectively and bring in clinicians quicker when a patient is deteriorating.\"\n\nIU Health is using several technological solutions to support clinicians beyond documentation.\n\nFor example, Rad AI, an imaging prompting tool, helps radiologists comb through massive queues of X-rays, mammograms, and other medical images.\n\n\"These kinds of products scan the images, look for things that the radiologist would typically document, then create a prompt and a note for the radiologist based on what would be commonly written to describe the findings in the image,\" Mansalis says. \"This is an assistive capability. Sometimes we find that these imaging tools have a greater sensitivity than a clinician alone. So we are providing greater sensitivity and specificity in our imaging assessments. We are also able to move through more images, so our productivity increases.\"\n\nThe health system is also using Artisight video camera technology in operating rooms.\n\n\"We are using this computer vision tool to look at surgeries as they are occurring with an AI capability that helps train physicians in new procedures,\" Mansalis says. Artisight can evaluate the surgery and provide documentation on open and close time. It helps our physicians who are training residents to learn new procedures and to have feedback to help them achieve the best practice.\"",

        "body": "At Microsoft we want to empower our customers to harness the full potential of new technologies like artificial intelligence, while meeting their privacy needs and expectations. Today we're sharing key aspects of how our approach to protecting privacy in AI - including our focus on security, transparency, user control, and continued compliance with data protection requirements - are core components of our new generative AI products like Microsoft Copilot.\n\nWe create our products with security and privacy incorporated through all phases of design and implementation. We provide transparency to enable people and organizations to understand the capabilities and limitations of our AI systems, and the sources of information that generate the responses they receive, by providing information in real-time as users engage with our AI products. We provide tools and clear choices so people can control their data, including through tools to access, manage, and delete personal data and stored conversation history.\n\nOur approach to privacy in AI systems is grounded in our longstanding belief that privacy is a fundamental human right. We are committed to continued compliance with all applicable laws, including privacy and data protection regulations, and we support accelerating the development of appropriate guardrails to build trust in AI systems.\n\nWe believe the approach we have taken to enhance privacy in our AI technology will help provide clarity to people about how they can control and protect their data in our new generative AI products.\n\nKeeping data secure is an essential privacy principle at Microsoft and is critical to ensuring trust in AI systems. Microsoft implements appropriate technical and organizational measures to ensure data is secure and protected in our AI systems.\n\nMicrosoft has integrated Copilot into many different services including Microsoft 365, Dynamics 365, Viva Sales, and Power Platform: each product is created and deployed with critical security, compliance, and privacy policies and processes. Our security and privacy teams employ both privacy and security by design throughout the development and deployment of all our products. We employ multiple layers of protective measures to keep data secure in our AI products like Microsoft Copilot, including technical controls like encryption, all of which play a crucial role in the data security of our AI systems. Keeping data protected and secure in AI systems - and ensuring that the systems are architected to respect data access and handling policies - are central to our approach. Security and privacy are principles that are built into our internal Responsible AI standard and we are committed to continuing to focus on privacy and security to keep our AI products safe and trustworthy.\n\nTransparency is another key principle for integrating AI into Microsoft products and services in a way that promotes user control and privacy, and builds trust. That's why we are committed to building transparency into people's interactions with our AI systems. This approach to transparency starts with providing clarity to users when they are interacting with an AI system if there is risk that they will be confused. And we provide real-time information to help people better understand how AI features work.\n\nMicrosoft Copilot uses a variety of transparency approaches that meet users where they are. Copilot provides clear information about how it collects and uses data, as well as its capabilities and its limitations. Our approach to transparency also helps people understand how they can best leverage the capabilities of Copilot as an everyday AI tool and provides opportunities to learn more and provide feedback.\n\nTo help people understand the capabilities of these new AI tools, Copilot provides in-product information that clearly lets users know that they are interacting with AI and provides easy-to-understand choices in a conversational style. As people interact, these disclosures and choices help provide a better understanding of how to harness the benefits of AI and limit potential risks.\n\nCopilot also provides information about how its responses are centered, or \"grounded\", on relevant content. In our AI offerings in Bing, Copilot.microsoft.com, Microsoft Edge, and Windows, our Copilot responses include information about the content from the web that helped generate the response. In Copilot for Microsoft 365, responses can also include information about the user's business data included in a generated response, such as emails or documents that you already have permission to access. By sharing links to input sources and source materials, people have greater control of their AI experience and can better evaluate the credibility and relevance of Microsoft Copilot outputs, and access more information as needed.\n\nMicrosoft provides tools that put people in control of their data. We believe all organizations offering AI technology should ensure consumers can meaningfully exercise their data subject rights.\n\nMicrosoft provides the ability to control your interactions with Microsoft products and services and honors your privacy choices. Through the Microsoft Privacy Dashboard, our account holders can access, manage, and delete their personal data and stored conversation history. In Microsoft Copilot, we honor additional privacy choices that our users have made in our cookie banners and other controls, including choices about data collection and use.\n\nThe Microsoft Privacy Dashboard allows users to access, manage and delete their data when signed into their Microsoft Account\n\nMicrosoft provides deeper information about how we protect individuals' privacy in Microsoft Copilot and our other AI products in our transparency materials such as M365 Copilot FAQs and The New Bing: Our Approach to Responsible AI, which are publicly available online. These transparency materials describe in greater detail how our AI products are designed, tested, and deployed - and how our AI products address ethical and social issues, such as fairness, privacy, security, and accountability. Our users and the public can also review the Microsoft Privacy Statement which provides information about our privacy practices and controls for all of Microsoft's consumer products.\n\nAI systems are new and complex, and we are still learning how we can best inform our users about our groundbreaking new AI tools in a meaningful way. We continue to listen and incorporate feedback to ensure we provide clear information about how Microsoft Copilot works.\n\nComplying with current laws, and supporting advancements in global data protection regulation\n\nMicrosoft is compliant today with data protection laws in all jurisdictions where we operate. We will continue to work closely with governments around the world to ensure we stay compliant, even as legal requirements develop and change.\n\nCompanies that develop AI systems have an important role to play in working with privacy and data protection regulators around the world to help them understand how AI technology is evolving. We engage with regulators to share information about how our AI systems work, how they protect personal data, the lessons we have learned as we have developed privacy, security and responsible AI governance systems, and our ideas about how to address unique issues around AI and privacy.\n\nRegulatory approaches to AI are advancing in the European Union through its AI Act, and in the United States through the President's Executive Order. We expect additional regulators around the globe will seek to address the opportunities and the challenges that new AI technologies will bring to privacy and other fundamental rights. Microsoft's contribution to this global regulatory discussion includes our Blueprint for Governing AI, where we make suggestions about the variety of approaches and controls governments may want to consider to protect privacy, advance fundamental rights, and ensure AI systems are safe. We will continue to work closely with data protection authorities and privacy regulators around the world as they develop their approaches.\n\nAs society moves forward in this era of AI, we will need privacy leaders within government, organizations, civil society, and academia to work together to advance harmonized regulations that ensure AI innovations benefit everyone and are centered on protecting privacy and other fundamental human rights.",

        "title": "The 10 Bet Sci-Fi Movies of 2023, Ranked",
        "body": "2023 has been a rather interesting year for movies. With numerous outstanding works of art being released and audiences finally starting to flock to theaters again after the hiatus brought on by the pandemic, things are looking good for cinema. Though there has been some outstanding work across multiple genres, one stands out among the most prolific this year: Science fiction.\n\nCOLLIDER VIDEO OF THE DAY SCROLL TO CONTINUE WITH CONTENT\n\nSome of the year's best sci-fi films are gems of animation, such as Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem. Others, like Asteroid City, are auteurial works of art more akin to arthouse sensibilities. The realm of sci-fi is one of infinite possibilities, filled with fascinating concepts like alien invasions, scientific experiments, and futuristic societies. If there's anything 2023 has proved, it's that sci-fi movies are just as great as they've always been.\n\n10 'Infinity Pool'\n\nDirector: Brandon Cronenberg\n\nBrandon Cronenberg, son of legendary Canadian auteur David Cronenberg, is a notable example of a filmmaker following their father's footsteps. However, it's thanks to movies like Infinity Pool, where a couple uncovers a perverse subculture of hedonism in an idyllic resort, that Brandon has proved that he's his own artist with a distinct style and thematic concerns.\n\nWith its relentless style (which initially garnered an NC-17 rating that forced edits to bring it down to an R rating) and the Cronenberg name attached, Infinity Pool had a lot of weight on its shoulders, and it mostly delivered. Creative, disturbing, and with a fantastic pair of tragically underrated performances by Alexander Skarsgård and Mia Goth, Infinity Pool is a sci-fi thriller with sharp and bloodthirsty teeth. It may not be quite as worthy of praise as some of the year's most popular sci-fi films, but it sure does deserve more recognition.\n\nInfinity Pool\n\nCast Alexander Skarsgard , Mia Goth , Cleopatra Coleman , Jalil Lespert Rating R Runtime 117 minutes Release Date January 27, 2023\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\n9 'No One Will Save You'\n\nDirector: Brian Duffield\n\nAlien invasion horror thrillers are so abundant that they tend to blend together. So, when one as special as No One Will Save You comes along, it stands out even more. Starring Kaitlyn Dever as an anxiety-ridden homebody, it sees its protagonist having to battle an alien who has found its way into her home. With pretty much no dialogue, the movie is practically a modern silent film, something audiences don't see too often nowadays.\n\nDespite its simplicity and its rather messy third act, No One Will Save You packs in a bunch of set pieces that will inevitably have viewers holding their breath and a few profound themes under the surface. Dever carries the whole thing on her shoulders without speaking more than a single line of dialogue, and director Brian Duffield clearly has a lot of fun twisting the alien invasion and home invasion genres on their heads.\n\nNo One Will Save You\n\nCast Kaitlyn Dever , Ginger Cressman , Zack Duhame , Geraldine Singer Rating PG-13 Runtime 93 minutes Release Date September 22, 2023\n\nWatch on Hulu\n\n8 'M3GAN'\n\nDirector: Gerard Johnstone\n\nCampy horror is hard to nail, but when it's done right with a good balance between silliness and scares, it can be really memorable; that's precisely what M3GAN achieves. A techno-horror thriller about an engineer who builds a lifelike robot doll that begins to take on a life of its own, M3GAN makes clever use of camp to enhance its eerie story of grief and parenthood.\n\nThe movie is mostly a teen horror flick, so its scares are tame enough that younger viewers will be able to enjoy them while also keeping the adults engaged. Just as frequently as it elicits chuckles from its audience, M3GAN can be a truly spine-chilling experience. Its commentary on technology will probably only be even more relevant as time goes on, ensuring that it remains a timeless classic for future horror buffs to enjoy.\n\nM3GAN\n\nCast Allison Williams , Violet McGraw , Ronny Chieng , Amie Donald Rating PG-13 Runtime 102 minutes Release Date January 6, 2023\n\nWatch on Amazon Prime\n\n7 'They Cloned Tyrone'\n\nDirector: Juel Taylor\n\nOn repeated occasions, Netflix has proved to be king when it comes to streaming sci-fi television projects. They are not to be underestimated when it comes to sci-fi films either, as this year's exceptional dark comedy They Cloned Tyrone proves. In it, a series of eerie events thrust an unlikely trio onto the trail of a sinister government conspiracy.\n\nDelightfully pulpy, hilariously satirical, and full of winks to the most influential Blaxploitation movies, They Cloned Tyrone never lets its intelligent use of sci-fi tropes trump its focus on themes like marginalization and forced assimilation. It's both intellectually provocative and endlessly stylish, benefiting from a razor-sharp sense of humor and a phenomenal cast led by John Boyega.\n\nThey Cloned Tyrone\n\nCast Jamie Foxx , John Boyega , Teyonah Parris , Kiefer Sutherland Rating R Runtime 122 minutes Release Date July 21, 2023\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\n6 'The Creator'\n\nDirector: Gareth Edwards\n\nShot on location on a modest budget and with many behind-the-scenes technological innovations, The Creator is the kind of sci-fi film that could make any movie fan say, \"They don't make them like this anymore.\" It tells the story of a hardened ex-special forces agent who, amid a war between humans and artificial intelligence, is recruited to hunt down and kill the elusive architect of humanity's enemies.\n\nThough it may not have fully lived up to the sky-high expectations surrounding it prior to its release, it's hard to fault the movie. The Creator is such an exquisitely creative, passionately made product of pure movie magic. A pioneer in what will surely be a new wave of sci-fi movies about A.I., The Creator is so fun, visually striking, and emotionally stirring that it's easy to overlook its flaws.\n\nThe Creator\n\nCast Ralph Ineson , Allison Janney , Gemma Chan , John David Washington , Ken Watanabe Rating PG-13 Release Date September 29, 2023\n\nWatch in theaters\n\n5 'Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3'\n\nDirector: James Gunn\n\nAfter a notoriously difficult production for an MCU project, Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 finally came out in 2023 to the excited acclaim of critics and fans. It sees Peter Quill rallying his team to defend the universe and one of their own, a mission that could prove to be the end of the Guardians if unsuccessful. Without a doubt the best entry in the franchise since Avengers: Endgame, Guardians 3 is an emotional roller coaster the likes of which Marvel cinema has never seen.\n\nWith a thrilling story of found family and friendship, Vol. 3 closes off some of the best character arcs in the MCU. It's a technical marvel with colorful visuals and great-as-ever music, but Guardians 3's main attraction is the deeply compelling story that shifts and twists the whole team dynamic in the most entertaining possible ways. The film is the epitome of a sci-fi adventure with striking visuals and a poignant story that won't leave a dry eye in the house.\n\nGuardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3\n\nCast Zoe Saldana , Dave Bautista , Vin Diesel , Bradley Cooper , Karen Gillan , Pom Klementieff , Elizabeth Debicki , Chris Pratt Rating PG-13 Runtime 150 minutes Release Date May 5, 2023\n\nWatch on Disney+\n\n4 'Asteroid City'\n\nDirector: Wes Anderson\n\nThe iconic Wes Anderson was probably the busiest filmmaker in 2023, having released not only four short films on Netflix based on Roald Dahl's stories but also one of the best features of his career. Asteroid City is an eccentric sci-fi dramedy following a writer in his famous fictional play about a grieving father traveling to a small rural town, where his world view is disrupted forever.\n\nThe film has the same kind of quirky Andersonesque style that fans of the director are more than familiar with while also adding some unexpected but profoundly welcome spice to the artist's formula. Immaculately meta and very subdued with its use of sci-fi elements, Asteroid City is a powerful celebration of the importance of art and dreams with a healthy dose of retro-futuristic charm that makes it a sci-fi classic in the making.\n\nAsteroid City\n\nCast Hong Chau , Hope Davis , Tom Hanks , Margot Robbie Rating R Runtime 105 minutes Release Date June 23, 2023\n\nWatch on Amazon Prime\n\n3 'Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem'\n\nDirector: Jeff Rowe\n\nFans of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles haven't exactly been treated to many exceptional silver-screen adaptations of the iconic reptile action team; Mutant Mayhem came to change that. With highly stylized animation reminiscent of the Spider-Verse movies, it follows the titular turtle brothers as they work to earn the love of New York City while facing an army of mutants.\n\nHighly energetic and visually unique, the film is both a visual treat and pure family-friendly fun with a clear love for its characters and source material. Simultaneously paying homage to its roots and freshening things up with lots of modern elements, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem presents a future for the franchise that's more exciting than ever before.\n\nTeenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Mutant Mayhem\n\nCast Rose Byrne , Seth Rogen , Giancarlo Esposito , Jackie Chan , Paul Rudd Release Date August 2, 2023\n\nWatch on Paramount+\n\n2 'Godzilla Minus One'\n\nDirector: Takashi Yamazaki\n\nThere have been a few successful Hollywood adaptations, but, at the end of the day, Godzilla is a concept tightly tied to Japan's cultural identity; thus, the King of Monsters is usually at his best when in his country of origin. Godzilla Minus One sees everyone's favorite gigantic city-destroyer attacking post-war Japan at its lowest point, forcing a surviving Kamikaze pilot to come to terms with his guilt to save his country.\n\nPerhaps one of the best kaiju movies of all time, Godzilla Minus One is just as much of a surprisingly well-written character drama as it is an explosive monster flick full of suspenseful action set pieces. The film takes things back to basics, with Godzilla embodying everything that he's come to represent: Nuclear paranoia, distrust of the government, raw, unchecked power, and how tragedy brings communities together. It's really powerful stuff, embellishing what might be the best Godzilla film since the original.\n\nGodzilla Minus One\n\nCast Ryûnosuke Kamiki , Minami Hamabe , Yûki Yamada , Sakura Andō Rating PG-13 Release Date December 1, 2023\n\nWatch in theaters\n\n1 'Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse'\n\nDirectors: Joaquim Dos Santos, Kemp Powers, Justin K. Thompson\n\nSince the moment it came out, Spider-Man: Into the Spider-Verse was hailed as one of the best animated movies of the 21st century, and rightfully so. Thus, a lot of pressure was on its sequel's shoulders. Not only did Spider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse live up to expectations, but it greatly surpassed them, even improving on a lot of elements of its predecessor. It continues Miles Morales's story as he catapults across the multiverse, clashing with a team of Spider-People charged with protecting reality itself.\n\nThe film has some of the most eye-popping animation that the medium has ever seen and a gripping, empowering story about constructing one's fate. Examining everything the character of Spidey represents, Across the Spider-Verse is far and away one of the Wall-Crawler's best films, putting together everything that made 2023 sci-fi great. In short, the film is a masterpiece that proves superhero cinema is far from dead.\n\nSpider-Man: Across the Spider-Verse\n\nCast Shameik Moore , Hailee Steinfeld , Oscar Isaac , Jake Johnson Genres Animation , Superhero , Action , Adventure Release Date June 2, 2023 Rating PG\n\nWatch on Netflix\n\nNEXT: The Best Movies of 2023",

        "title": "Answers: Navellier's \"AI Blueprint\" Stocks",
        "body": "\"For the First Time in Over 40 Years...\n\n\"Wall Street's 'King of Quants' Reveals His Secret $6 BILLION\n\nAI Blueprint\n\n\"'If you apply my \"Secret Blueprint\" to the red-hot AI market, the next 12 months could be extremely lucrative... even if you've only got $500 to start with!'\"\n\nNavellier is one of many who says he sees an \"explosion in new wealth\" coming from AI, and he's selling his Growth Investor newsletter by promising a few \"special reports\" that highlight his favorites in this space. And this letter has gotten inexpensive now, they've cut the sale price to $29, so presumably it's being pushed as a feeder subscription to get more folks into the marketing funnel (Navellier's name is attached to half a dozen \"upgrade\" letters and packages at InvestorPlace, including the Power Portfolio ($1,799) and AI Revolution ($2,799) projects that combine picks from Luke Lango, Eric Fry and Navellier).\n\nAnd there's a long sales pitch about how artificial intelligence is going to be the next great tech revolution, mirroring the growth of the internet, or of mobile computing, and maybe exceeding the growth of those... which is essentially the same as the big-picture spiel we get from almost everybody, though in Navellier's case, at least, we have a pundit who was around for the first internet boom and was picking growth stocks in the 1990s.\n\nBut what we're interested in, of course, are the \"secret\" stocks he hints at... so let's skip ahead and get to those clues.\n\nThe main \"special report\" he's peddling is called \"Three Incredible AI Stocks... for a Six-Figure Payday\" ... and he drops a few hints about those three stocks, so let's put the Thinkolator to work...\n\n\"... there are over 6,000 companies that trade on the major stock exchanges...\n\n\"Only a few hundred of these are pure AI plays...\n\n\"And I've run every single one of these AI companies through my eight-part filtering system...\n\n\"Based on my stringent eight-part assessment of the companies in the AI industry, I've pinpointed exactly three AI stocks that meet all eight criteria for explosive growth potential...\"\n\nI don't know what he means by a \"pure\" AI play, but I'd say there are only a couple dozen of those, at most -- and none of them are making money exclusively from AI, so the \"purity\" varies. But certainly there are hundreds of stocks who are interested in AI, or building something using AI, or trying to convince people that they're \"AI pure plays\".\n\nWhat's the first one? Hints:\n\n\"The 'Stealth' Firm Securing America's AI Dominance....\n\n\"Remember, the heart of the AI Revolution comes in the form of computational power.\n\n\"In order to make AI a reality, you need very powerful computers.\n\n\"And that power boils down to one thing... highly specialized computer chips.\n\n\"This is exactly why companies producing groundbreaking computer chips have been exploding over the past few years.\n\n\"Nvidia began skyrocketing last year shortly after unveiling its 144-core CPU Superchip. Shares are up roughly 1,000% as a result.\n\n\"There's not enough supply to meet demand.\n\n\"It's the same story with the semiconductor firm Advanced Micro Devices (AMD), whose share price has been going vertical over the past few years. They recently unveiled their most powerful AI chip to date... called the MI300x....\n\n\"According to McKinsey, specialized memory for AI has 4.5X the bandwidth than does traditional memory. Customers are willing to pay a pretty penny for that type of performance upgrade -- about $25 per gigabyte versus $8 for regular memory chips.\n\n\"Profit margins are 'off the charts' for the semiconductor companies that can produce chips with enough memory and storage capacity to handle the enormous data sets needed to advance AI technology.\"\n\nThat's hit or miss at this point, mostly because most chipmakers make more than one kind of chip, for more than one market. NVIDIA has record profit margins right now, which is also a risk for this company, since they seem destined to come back down at some point... but Micron (MU), for example, which provides some of the memory chips for some AI chipsets, has unusually weak margins in recent quarters, largely because demand has dipped for other kinds of electronics (laptops, smartphones, etc.). Not every market moves at the same speed, and a lot of companies were caught a little flat-footed by how fast the demand for AI chips grew this year.\n\nThen some more specifics...\n\n\"And on Page 2 of my newest AI report, you'll get the full details of a semiconductor company that is set to challenge Nvidia and AMD for AI chip supremacy.\n\n\"In fact, it's the only company of this type accredited by the U.S. Department of Defense as a Trusted Supplier in the AI chip sector....\n\n\"Its tools are so powerful that the government recently shut down China's access to them.\n\n\"Not only that, but large amounts of money have been flowing into this companies coffers lately.\n\n\"In fact, they are expecting revenue to top $4 billion for 2023.\n\n\"I wouldn't be surprised if this little-known AI firm becomes the next trillion-dollar Wall Street darling in the years to come as the AI Revolution unfolds.\"\n\nOur best bet there? This is very likely to be Marvell (MRVL), which I believe is the only accredited semiconductor supplier for the Defense Department that's also got an AI-related business (though there are almost no real \"pure play\" AI companies just yet), has fallen under some of the China export restrictions, and which has revenue somewhere in the neighborhood of $4 billion.\n\nThose clues are somewhat limited and vague, it's true, so we should hesitate to say this is a 100% certain match... but it's as good as we get for the Thinkolator today. The only other stock that's fairly close to being a match on revenue is Cadence Design Systems (CDNS), but they don't really sell or design chips, they just sell the chip design systems and software. You could also stretch and make Skyworks Solutions (SWKS) fit some of the clues, but they're really not even a side play on AI at this point and the match is a bit of a stretch in most ways -- SWKS is still primarily dependent on the volume of iPhones sold, which has been both a blessing and a curse over the past decade, depending on the year.\n\nFor what it's worth, Louis Navellier isn't just a pundit, he also runs a money management business, there are separate accounts under his name, and those accounts are quite large so he his firm has to file 13F updates each quarter. That means we do get a little bit of an idea, beyond the newsletter recommendations and teaser picks and free articles that are everywhere attached to his name, about what his firm is actually buying and selling for its investors (he doesn't manage mutual funds anymore -- he did for a long time, but my recollection is that they were pretty consistently terrible, since his system takes such huge hits in down markets, and have faded away).\n\nMarvell hasn't made that list of Navellier & Associates holdings in any of the quarters so far this year, so it is not among the top 300 or so stocks that his firm recommends owning to its own investors. The only companies that might be described as offering AI \"hardware\" in some way that are in the latest 13F filings for Navellier's managed accounts are NVIDIA (NVDA), server maker Super Micro Computer (SMCI), Microsoft (MSFT), diversified chipmaker Broadcom (AVGO), data center switchmaker Arista Networks (ANET)... some of those have been reduced of late, though, so the ones he's been buying as of the last quarter (ending September 30, reported on the mid-November 13F) are MSFT, SMCI and AVGO. None of those come close to matching the clues here, that's just an FYI.\n\nSo what's the story with Marvell? They do have a nice business building chips for the high-end servers that are in demand for AI work, and that is expected to grow dramatically over the next year... but it was slower to spool up than expected in the first couple quarters of this year, and it's balanced by the much weaker industrial and consumer electronics businesses at the moment. Here's the quote from the CEO in the last quarterly press release that pretty well sums it up:\n\n\"Marvell delivered third quarter fiscal 2024 revenue of $1.419 billion, growing 6% sequentially, above the midpoint of guidance. Revenue from our datacenter end market grew over 20% sequentially in the third quarter, and we expect growth of over 30% sequentially in our fourth quarter. The diversification of our portfolio is serving us well, with strong growth from AI and cloud carrying us through a softening demand environment in other end markets. These dynamics are reflected in our forecast for overall revenue to be flat sequentially in the fourth quarter at the midpoint of guidance.\"\n\nTo parse through that word salad, the summary is, \"AI is growing fast, but everything else is shrinking, and that means revenue will be about the same this quarter as it was last quarter.\"\n\nIn numbers terms, MRVL is in the same situation as a lot of companies who surged with the electronics hardware demand of the work-from-home years -- their earnings are going to fall this year from last year, but the expectation is that AI and other factors (but mostly AI, and mostly big buying to beef up data centers for AI, specifically) will get them back to earnings growth next year. In adjusted earnings terms, that means MRVL posted $2.12 in earnings per share last year, is expected to have $1.51 this year, and will get to growing again from this base, to $2.02 in 2025 and $2.78 in 2026. Those are all adjusted numbers, and MRVL has always had a huge stock-based compensation number so the \"adjustment\" is big -- over the past four quarters, MRVL had a GAAP net loss of $556 million, so it's mostly just by ignoring the non-cash expense of $585 million in stock-based compensation that they can report an \"adjusted\" profit.\n\nSo if we live with that \"adjusted\" nature of those earnings, as we often have to with tech companies, then that means MRVL is in the middle of a period when adjusted earnings will grow by about 10% per year, on average ($2.12 to $2.78 in three years). If we just accept the new starting point of $1.51 in earnings this year, then it's far more dramatic growth of 36% per year... you can make those numbers tell whichever story you like, but they should, at least have good growth from here. For that, the current valuation today is just under 30X next year's estimated adjusted earnings.\n\nIt might work out, but by those measures NVDA, at about 25X next year's forecast for adjusted earnings, is actually quite a bit cheaper than Marvell. There is some potential upside for Marvell when it comes to ASIC production for AI, I think -- it seems likely that we'll transition to a world where not every AI project needs big and overpowered GPUs like NVIDIA's that can do everything, but that many AI inferencing or processing tasks will end up using customized ASIC hardware. Marvell makes those custom ASICs for AI, and that could become a surprisingly huge business, faster than we think... but it's not yet a big deal. I guess that's the area where analysts are most likely to underestimate the potential, if you're looking for a surprise... but moving to custom ASICs and building out new kinds of hardware like that for new applications often takes a long time, so it might not happen quickly (and there is, of course, no guarantee that Marvell will dominate in custom ASICs for AI).\n\nInteresting company, I don't think I understand the breadth of their portfolio well enough to go much deeper than that, but at 30X forward earnings there's clearly a high AI expectation built in -- maybe they can exceed that, maybe not, it's going to be an interesting year. As of November, Marvell gets a \"B\" in Navellier's public PortfolioGrader system.\n\nWhat's next? The clues get even thinner for the next two...\n\n\"... an AI company that currently boasts a portfolio of 1,250 issued patents and 251 pending patents.\n\nThey're based in Silicon Valley and provide unified security solutions that can be deployed over digital networks to protect users against malware, spam and network intrusions.\n\n\"Even though very few people know about this company yet, they entered the AI space a few years ago through the unveiling of a new cybersecurity system that automatically examines billions of code \"features\" in order to determine if unknown files are legitimate or malicious.\n\n\"They've quickly managed to ship more security solutions than any other cybersecurity firm worldwide.\n\n\"And the money is flowing in BIG TIME.\n\n\"This company is still in the early stages of growth. I wouldn't be shocked to see share prices surge by 500% or more over the next few years.\"\n\nThis could be several of the big cybersecurity firms, many of which are based in Silicon Valley... most of them are highlighting their AI chops these days, talking up the ways in which they're using machine learning to improve the fight against the black hats (and counter the AI that intruders are using to try to breach networks)... but that \"1,250 issued patents and 251 pending patents\" tells us this is Fortinet (FTNT). Those numbers are not particularly up to date, so I doubt they're accurate now, but the company has cited them in the past and, more importantly for our purposes, the InvestorPlace writers have often highlighted those specific patent numbers in their throwaway articles, including this undated Special Report from Louis Navellier himself.\n\nAnd Fortinet has had two very poorly-received earnings reports in a row, leading to big drops in both early August and early November from which it hasn't yet recovered, so it's a little surprising that it still has even a \"B\" rating in Navellier's PortfolioGrader system... I guess the key is that Navellier's system is driven more by reported earnings \"beats\" than by weak guidance, since it's been guidance that has disappointed of late.\n\nAnd yes, Fortinet is in the 13F for Navellier's managed accounts business... though it's not a huge position, less than 0.5% of their 13F portfolio.\n\nFor me, I own some companies that are at least partially involved with cybersecurity, like Cloudflare (NET), but the pure cybersecurity stocks that fight malware and deal with network protection and firewalls are in the \"too hard\" pile. It seems like it should be a great growth industry, since almost every company is willing to pay almost any price to avoid the worst cyberattacks and ransomware efforts... but it's also an industry where the competition is dramatic, and it's too hard for me to understand what winners might emerge (and, more importantly, it's hard to guess which company will have a dramatically terrible year as a product fails or a competitor eats their lunch). In the past I've sometimes used the oldest Cyber Security ETF (HACK) for exposure to this sector, but, as you can see, that rising tide of cybersecurity spending has not necessarily lifted that sector enough to offset the competition within the sector -- this is HACK's total return since inception, it has had a good year in 2023, and before that did very well in 2021, but the bad years hit hard and it is still trailing the S&P 500 over the past nine years.\n\nIncidentally, Fortinet is a huge underweight in that HACK ETF, for whatever reason -- it is the second-largest \"pure\" cybersecurity firm these days, I think, the market cap at $44 billion is second only to Crowdstrike (CRWD, $62 billion), but it is not even in the top ten holdings of the ETF. Here are the top 20, it's a pretty good sum-up of the larger players in the industry, including the big government contractors Leidos (LDOS) and Booz Allen Hamilton (BAH) as well as the big firewall, intrusion detection and identity management companies. I bet they're all talking up their spending on AI at this point.\n\nFortinet may be special and primed to be an unusually strong grower in this space, though that's not the investor consensus right now. They have been a leader over the past decade, despite having a weak year in 2023. Today, the analysts think they're in the middle of a multi-year period that will average earnings growth of 15-20%, and the stock is current valued at a little over 30X next year's adjusted earnings (37X GAAP earnings), so it's pretty close to the top end of a \"growth at a reasonable price\" valuation in my book.\n\nAnd one more...\n\n\"Because of the relative obscurity of this company... and the unique position they're in, I can't go into much detail right now.\n\n\"Essentially, this company is one of the few in the world that makes the equipment necessary to inspect semiconductor chips.\n\n\"The company's earnings have been on a tear for the past four quarters, and I expect earnings will likely continue to soar as the company continues to improve its AI capabilities.\"\n\nThat's obviously not a lot in the way of clues, but the Thinkolator offers us some hope...\n\nThere are several fairly large semiconductor inspection equipment companies, so it's not especially easy to narrow it down just by the kind of work they do -- if you're just looking at US-listed stocks this could feasibly be one of the giants like Lam Research (LRCX) or KLA Corp (KLAC), either of which will benefit from increasingly complex chips and higher sales volumes of chips, over time... or a smaller firm in testing like AEHR Systems (AEHR) or Onto Innovation (ONTO). Those four are not the only companies who sell equipment related to chip testing, of course, there are smaller firms, too, like Formfactor (FORM), and some Japanese firms that don't have easy US trading and presumably wouldn't make it into Navellier's letters, like Visco Technologies or Lasertec. But that's probably the universe Navellier is picking from.\n\nSo what's our best match? Well, given that he says \"earnings have been on a tear for the past four quarters,\" which probably means he's starting in mid-2022, then there's one choice that really jumps out -- AEHR Test Systems (AEHR) has indeed grown earnings rapidly over the past 4-6 quarters, while most of the others have actually seen their profits flatten out or decline during that particularly time period. AI hasn't had much of an impact on the operations or fundamentals of these semiconductor equipment companies this year, mostly just because the rest of the semiconductor industry has been pretty moribund... though the future enthusiasm about AI is probably helping their share prices. Here's the earnings-per-share growth for all of those firms over the past two years:\n\nOf course, that has also been reflected in the share prices, to at least some degree, so AEHR leads the pack there, too... though it has come down sharply since the highs of the Summer:\n\nAEHR has also been one of the highest-ranked semi equipment companies in Louis Navellier's portfolio grader system all year, usually given an \"A\", though it has bumped down to \"B\" as of November. So we'll pencil that in as our likely match. Lam Research and KLA Corp are both in the Navellier & Associates 13F filing for last quarter, for what it's worth, AEHR is not.\n\nAEHR is relatively small, with a market cap of $800 million and only one or two analysts covering the company, so the estimates are not going to do us any good -- but they have posted tremendous earnings growth this year, have quickly become very profitable, and have almost doubled their sales over the past year, so they have some growth chops and they believe that growth will continue. They're trading at a growth valuation, too, with a trailing PE of about 45... but if the business is going to keep up the recently dramatic growth that's pretty easy to justify.\n\nThe challenge is that AEHR's specialty is in testing equipment for silicon carbide chips, which are used for higher voltage and higher temperature applications... so it has been considered by investors to be largely a play on electric vehicles, which suddenly seemed to be \"topping out\" this year as demand for EVs has been disappointing, perhaps partly because of higher interest rates and the still pretty slow rollout of high-speed charging infrastructure... and it's also a very concentrated business, with most of its business this year coming from On Semiconductor (ON), by far its largest customer. Both ON and AEHR issued guidance that the market considered to be disappointing last quarter.\n\nSo is Navellier pitching AEHR, which this year has been the fastest growing semiconductor test equipment company... but is also extremely small and volatile? Or might he be pitching one of the stalwart leaders like KLAC and LRCX? I'll stick with AEHR as my guess, but it's probably the least exposed to high-end AI chips among the testing companies so far... and that's really a guess.\n\nThey've all been popular ideas this year as the expectation of investment in more semiconductor foundries leads people to expect more investment in equipment for all those foundries, though perhaps there's some reality check settling in, as investors realize how many years it takes to build these big chip facilities in the US. The big guys have been doign well, despite the drop in earnings this year, both KLAC and LRCX are expected to grow earnings at a 15-25% pace from here, and they're both trading at 25-30X earnings, so they could slip pretty easily into a \"growth at a reasonable price\" portfolio if the analysts turn out to be right in their projections -- LRCX has been a \"B\" in Navellier's Portfolio Grader for most of the year, and KLAC has been at \"B\" all year.\n\nSo... think those will be the big AI winners? Semiconductor equipment? Chipmakers who might benefit from data center spending and the emergence of customized AI chips? Cybersecurity companies who use AI (and fight AI malware)? None of the above? It's your money, so you get to make the call -- we'd love to hear what you think if you've got a moment to enter a comment in the happy little box below...",

        "body": "A leader with more than 25 years of experience in higher education, Dr. Kimberly Andrews Espy was unanimously elected the 13th president of Wayne State University in 2023 by the Board of Governors\n\nI have been so impressed with the university's commitment to our community and engagement with others to make an impact. Through teaching, research and service in partnerships with the business community, clinical partners, nonprofits, foundations, faith-based institutions and governmental entities, our faculty, staff and students are advancing the fabric of our communities. Wayne State is truly a university in, with and for Detroit -- and helping to make our city a better place.\n\nWayne State has a long history of successfully enabling access to a top-tier college education for those with the determination and talent to succeed, regardless of their background, age or ZIP code. The Michigan Assured Admission Pact is just another tool in our toolbox that makes the admission decision crystal clear. This way, every hard-working high school student knows they can pursue their dreams for a bright future through higher education. The MAAP will increase college-going and fuel our talent pipeline for Detroit's 21st century economy.\n\nWe know that one of the biggest barriers to attending college is family resources - Wayne State has been successful by addressing affordability through investing heavily in financial aid for our talented students. As a result, more than half of our first-year students are attending Wayne State tuition free, thanks to a combination of financial aid programs including the Wayne State Guarantee, the Heart of Detroit Tuition Pledge and the Detroit Promise. Once students are enrolled, we continue to invest in them by providing services such as professional coaching; peer mentors; and high-touch, care-driven support and monitoring.\n\nWe're proud that the large majority of Wayne State grads stay in the Detroit area and work as doctors, business leaders, lawyers, teachers and other professionals. Retaining even more graduates across the state will take all of us. Public research universities, industry and government need to come together to create and support thriving urban environments where young people want work, play and live. Through partnering, these urban ecosystems in turn create and attract new businesses in a virtuous cycle, with skilled jobs at competitive wages that benefit our communities.\n\nWayne State is a university of opportunity, taking students to a different place than where they started. On average, there is no better public or personal investment than a college education to promote career success, and yet there certainly are many examples of successful individuals with other paths. Universities can further promote the value of college by coupling top-tier academics with \"learning by doing\" experiences that foster in-demand marketable skills such as problem-solving, leadership, teaming and communication through partnerships with employers.\n\nOur faculty are second to none. They work on cutting-edge basic and applied research and technology development in innovative areas. From tiny sensors and next-generation clean power to artificial intelligence and quantum computing. Developing new compounds that are the medicines of the future to developing new virtual reality therapies to improve mental health. The work at Wayne State will drive the new economies of the future. What's more exciting than that? Our research universities can, though, better communicate the advantage of learning directly from our faculty experts who play such an important part in creating a brighter future for Detroit and the world.\n\nWayne State remains committed to partnering with the Chamber to share best practices and develop new platforms for growing talent in our region, supporting residents in expanding their academic credentials and providing educational opportunities to support career advancement for students of all ages. I'm proud that this fall we enrolled 147 new Detroit Promise students. The work we do together supports the talent and advanced research needs of the state to ensure Michigan businesses, nonprofits, and startup organizations flourish.",

        "body": "In a notable insider transaction, Tomer Weingarten, the President and CEO of SentinelOne Inc (NYSE:S), sold 47,365 shares of the company on December 15, 2023. This move has caught the attention of investors and market analysts, as insider sales can provide valuable insights into a company's prospects and the confidence level of its top executives.\n\nTomer Weingarten is a prominent figure in the cybersecurity industry, serving as the President and CEO of SentinelOne Inc. Under his leadership, the company has grown to become a key player in the cybersecurity space, offering cutting-edge solutions to protect against a wide range of digital threats.

With 69 insider sells and no insider buys, this could signal a lack of confidence among those with intimate knowledge of the company's workings.\n\nTomer Weingarten's recent sale of 47,365 shares is part of a larger pattern, as he has sold a total of 1,124,007 shares over the past year without making any purchases.

This visual representation can help investors discern patterns and consider how insider behavior aligns with their investment strategies.\n\nWhile the insider selling activity at SentinelOne Inc, led by President and CEO Tomer Weingarten, may not necessarily indicate a negative forecast for the company, it is a factor that should be weighed by current and potential investors. It is essential to look at the broader context, including market conditions, the company's financial performance, and industry trends, to make informed investment decisions.\n\nInvestors are advised to monitor further insider transactions and consider the potential implications for SentinelOne Inc's stock price.

        "title": "AI Governance in 2024: An Overview",
        "body": "In a world where artificial intelligence (AI) seems is leaping forward and is growing at a CAGR of almost 40%, questions about governance and ethics with the use of AI are surfacing.\n\nAs humans continue to develop AI systems, it is crucial to establish proper guidelines to ensure powerful technologies like generative AI and adaptive AI are used in a responsible manner.\n\nIn this article, we'll have a look at an overview of AI governance, exploring the key concepts, challenges, and potential solutions that can shape a future with AI in a way that benefits everyone.\n\nWhat is AI governance?\n\nAI governance refers to the set of policies, laws, and regulations that govern the development, deployment, and use of artificial intelligence. It aims to address issues in AI systems such as:\n\nThe ultimate goal of AI governance is to ensure that AI is developed and used in a way that both aligns with societal values and benefits everyone. Putting AI governenace into action is still being defined, but it may include:\n\nAs AI technologies become more advanced and integrated into our daily lives, the potential impact they can have on society is growing exponentially. Without proper governance, these powerful tools can pose significant risks to individuals, communities, and even entire nations.\n\nFor example, biased algorithms used in hiring or loan decisions can perpetuate discrimination and inequality. Automated decision-making systems in the criminal justice system could lead to biased sentencing and incarceration rates.\n\nOn the other hand, with proper governance in place, AI has the potential to bring enormous benefits, such as:\n\nTherefore, it is vital to establish strong governance frameworks that can promote the responsible development and use of AI.\n\nToday, several efforts are already in progress to develop effective AI governance systems. One example is the AI Bill of Rights in the U.S., which states that AI systems should be accountable, transparent, and secure. Other countries, have also developed national strategies for responsible AI development and use, including:\n\nOngoing research and discussions are also being conducted to address emerging challenges and identify potential solutions for governing AI systems.\n\nKey concepts in AI Governance\n\nAI governance can feel like an opaque topic: what does it really mean? Breaking it into these five concepts, however, makes it easier to grasp.\n\nAccountability\n\nOne of the core principles of AI governance, accountability involves:\n\nTransparency\n\nTransparency refers to making the inner workings of AI systems accessible and understandable to those affected by their decisions. This can be achieved in many ways, including clear documentation, open-source code, and testing and validation processes.\n\nFairness\n\nFairness in AI governance means ensuring that AI systems do not discriminate against any group or individual. Ensuring fairness in AI systems involves a variety of approaches, such as:\n\nOngoing monitoring is also important to ensure that the system continues to behave fairly as it is exposed to new data.\n\nPrivacy\n\nPrivacy concerns play a significant role in AI governance as these technologies often involve the collection and use of sensitive personal data. It is essential to establish clear guidelines for handling this data and protecting individuals' privacy rights.\n\nSecurity is another crucial aspect of AI governance, especially with regard to:\n\nRobust security measures must be put in place to safeguard AI systems and their data from malicious actors. When it comes to AI governance, there is no one-size-fits-all approach. Different countries and organizations have different priorities and concerns, resulting in variations in their governance frameworks.\n\nTo get started, you can explore AI risk frameworks such as the NIST AI risk management framework (AI RMF).\n\nAI governance models based on human involvement\n\nTo ensure responsible AI development, we need to consider how much human oversight is required. Here are three models to consider:\n\nHuman-in-the-loop\n\nIn this model, humans are involved in the decision-making process and have the final say. Machines provide recommendations or assist in decision-making -- but ultimately, a human has the power to override their suggestions.\n\nThis model allows for human intervention when necessary, ensuring that ethical considerations are taken into account before any decisions are made.\n\nHuman-on-the-loop\n\n\"Human-on-the-loop\" is a concept related to the operation and oversight of autonomous systems, especially in the context of artificial intelligence (AI) and military applications.\n\nIt represents a middle ground between fully autonomous systems (\"human-out-of-the-loop\") and those that require continuous human control or decision-making (\"human-in-the-loop\"). For example, a human can intervene and abort an action taken by the AI at any time.\n\nHuman-out-of-the-loop\n\nIn this model, machines make decisions autonomously without any human involvement.\n\nThis can be useful in situations where time is of the essence or when humans may not have all the necessary information to make informed decisions. However, it also creates potential risks if something goes wrong and there is no human oversight.\n\nChallenges in AI governance\n\nAs with any emerging technology, developing effective AI governance systems is not without its challenges. Here are some possible challenges organizations will face:\n\nTo help address these challenges, let's look at some potential solutions.\n\nPotential solutions for effective AI governance\n\nDespite the challenges, efforts are being made to develop effective AI governance systems. Here are some potential solutions that can contribute to achieving this goal:\n\nCollaboration and coordination\n\nCoordinating between different stakeholders is vital for effective AI governance. International collaborations, partnerships between the public and private sectors, and multi-stakeholder forums can help facilitate this. One example is the AI Governance Alliance, coordinated by the World Economic Forum.\n\nRegulatory sandboxes\n\nThese are controlled environments where companies can test new products or services under regulatory supervision. This allows developers to innovate while regulators can:\n\nMany organizations have already developed ethical AI principles that can serve as a framework for responsible development and use of AI systems.\n\nCertification schemes\n\nSimilar to product safety certifications, these schemes can provide assurance that AI systems comply with certain standards and are safe to use.\n\n(Check out cybersecurity certifications, some of which may include AI governance components.)\n\nContinuous monitoring and evaluation\n\nIt is essential to continuously monitor and evaluate AI systems' performance (through robust AIOps) and their impact on society. This can help identify any potential issues and inform necessary updates or adjustments to governance frameworks.\n\nFAQs about AI governance\n\nWhat roles can the public and private sectors play in AI governance?\n\nThe public sector can play a pivotal role in AI governance by setting regulations, providing oversight, and promoting transparency and accountability.\n\nThe private sector, on the other hand, can contribute by innovating responsibly, adhering to established regulations, and actively participating in conversations around ethical AI practices.\n\nHow does AI governance support privacy rights?\n\nAI governance supports privacy rights by establishing guidelines on how sensitive personal data is collected, stored, used, and shared. This includes implementing proper data anonymization techniques, obtaining informed consent from users, and ensuring compliance with data protection laws.\n\nFinal thoughts\n\nAI governance is crucial for ensuring the responsible development and use of AI systems. While it presents its fair share of challenges, efforts are being made to address them and develop effective governance frameworks.\n\nAs AI continues to advance and integrate into various aspects of our lives, it is essential to continuously monitor and evaluate its impact on society and make necessary adjustments to governance systems. Therefore, organizations must stay informed about current developments in the field and participate in conversations around ethical AI practices.",

        "title": "Artificial Intelligence: Neobank Dave launches GPT chatbot for scalable customer service",
        "body": "The Fintech Blueprint team will be taking a break for the holidays from December 23 -- January 7th. We will return in the new year with fresh insights. Happy Holidays!\n\nGm Fintech Futurists --\n\nWelcome to AI in Finance, focused on the application of artificial intelligence -- LLMs, generative AI, machine learning, deep learning, and neural networks -- to financial services.\n\nToday we highlight the following:\n\nFor weekly deep dives on the frontier of fintech, check out our premium offering.\n\nNeobank Dave recently launched DaveGPT, an AI-powered chatbot that responds to customer inquiries in real-time. The tool generates an 89% resolution rate, a major improvement over Dave's previous bot, DaveBot.\n\nDave CEO Jason Wilk says DaveGPT's large language model approach provides a superior and more human service while saving staffing, training and infrastructure costs. The GenAI chatbot enables Dave to serve its 9 million customers with only 300 employees, a whopping 30,000 customers per employee. Compare this level of scalability, essential to the success of startups like Dave, to the customer density of traditional banks, which in the European Union has reached up to 225 customers per employee.\n\nDave collaborates with Aisera to interact with OpenAI's LLM capabilities, fine-tuned by Dave, to create DaveGPT's ultra-relevant responses that resolve nearly 9 out of 10 customer inquiries. Over time, Wilk envisions personalizing advice by factoring in users' financial data - a level of personalization other financial institutions such as Commerz Bank are striving for using GenAI avatars.\n\nThis level of success with AI in financial services is not limited to fintech startups. Ken Moore, CIO at Mastercard, notes that institutions are just scratching the surface of what generative AI can do for banks. He expects that within the next 12 months, GenAI will be integral to all processes, ranging from customer service to financial advising, security, and marketing.\n\nIn fact, established financial leaders such as JP Morgan have already started to adopt AI chatbots as financial advisors.\n\nIf institutions throughout the industry do indeed adopt AI, we can expect cost reductions of up to 22% across front office, middle office, and back office by 2030, saving institutions nearly $1T across the board. Per McKinsey, GenAI could further add $200-$340B in annual profit for banks, equivalent to 9-15% of current operating profits. McKinsey projects the greatest profit gains in corporate and retail banking, at $56 billion and $54 billion respectively.\n\nSpecific opportunities include using AI to automate manual processes like testing, assess regulatory impacts, and extract insights from unstructured customer data to improve service quality. Additional areas of value include fraud detection, personalized financial planning and advice, operational efficiency, risk management model development,\n\nThese projections, combined with DaveGPT's demonstrated performance, are an optimistic view on how AI could deliver efficiency gains, cost savings, and customer satisfaction for modern fintech platforms that deploy the technology. That said, it is also fair to have reservations about how far conversational interfaces can go in transforming the customer experience. Early fintech chatbot platforms like Kasisto, large contact center software providers, like Twilio, as well as neobanks like Dave, have struggled to maintain value in the current market environment.\n\nWe are optimistic that GPT front-ends will indeed support millions of customers and be both useful and empathetic in discussing financial products. However, we are skeptical that embedding the technology into an existing footprint will bring about a platform shift. More likely, a destination of AI conversation traffic will have multiple financial products embedded therein.\n\n👑 Related Coverage 👑\n\nWith a 35% open rate and 1 million post views per month, we have an engaged audience of Fintech, DeFi, and AI enthusiasts receptive to your messaging.\n\nContact us to learn more about our custom opportunities.\n\nHere are the rest of the updates hitting our radar.\n\nArtificial intelligence now capable of creating new AI without human intervention, scientists say - NY Post\n\n⭐ E-commerce fintech SellersFi secures $3M credit facility from Citi - Fintech Nexus\n\nSquare's departing CEO on Gen AI: You don't need an MBA to run a startup - eFinancial Careers\n\n⭐ Equinix enables private AI infrastructure for businesses - Venture Beat\n\nThe holidays are fast approaching and you still have a chance to gift something special to those interested in AI, Fintech and DeFi.\n\nIf you're searching for a thoughtful and impactful gift this season, consider gifting the Fintech Blueprint Premium Subscription. 🎁\n\nPremium members receive:",

        "title": "Artificial Intelligence Adding New Depths to 3D Scanning",
        "body": "3D scanners are used across a wide range of industries and applications due to their ability to capture the physical dimensions of objects and environments quickly and accurately, enabling their digitization with complex geometry and rich textures in high resolution. 3D scanning has been used in manufacturing auto parts, healthcare, and rocketry, but its adoption rate has been slowed by the steep learning curve for professional 3D scanning technologies. This article reveals how advances in Artificial Intelligence (AI) will improve the learning curve for 3D scanning technologies, making the processes as simple as taking a video.\n\nThe Market\n\nAccording to Allied Market Research, the global 3D scanning market size was valued at $3.72 billion in 2020 and is projected to reach $16.66 billion by 2030, registering a CAGR of 16.3% from over the period. Modor Intelligence puts the market at $3.1 billion in 2023, growing to $6.23 billion in 2028, a CAGR of 15%. There are 3D applications in nearly every industry; here are just a few examples:\n\n3D Scanning Technologies\n\nThere are multiple technologies enabling 3D scanning; the first four are considered active 3D capture technologies, and the last is considered passive 3D capture.\n\nLaser triangulation projects a laser beam (either a line or a single point) onto a surface and measures the deformation of the laser ray. This type of scanning offers high resolution and accuracy, but it is highly sensitive to the subject's surface; therefore, shiny, transparent, or dark surfaces are problematic.\n\nStructured light scanning measures the deformation of a light pattern when projected onto a surface. This technology does not rely on a laser but rather a projection of a series of linear patterns onto the object. The deformation of such patterns is used to calculate the distance and the object's surface. The main advantage of this type of scanning is its speed and resolution; also, non-harmful light can be used, making it practical for body scans. Bright light conditions can, however, negatively impact its accuracy.\n\nContact-based 3D scanning technology is based on sampling several points on a surface, measured by a mechanical, optical, or physical probe - basically by physical touch. This technology is widely used for quality control because its main advantage is its precision and ability to handle transparent or reflective surfaces, unlike laser triangulation.\n\nLaser pulse scanning is also known as Time of Flight (ToF) or Lidar (in newer iPhones). The laser beam is projected onto a surface and recollected by a sensor. The time of travel of the laser between its emission and reception gives the surface's distance and geometrical information to the 3D scanner. Each measure collects only one point, so the scanner must cast its laser 360 degrees around the point, usually done with a mirror that changes the laser's orientation. The advantage of this technology is its ability to scan very large objects and environments, but it is relatively slow, given its single-point nature.\n\nPhotogrammetry, also called \"3D scans from photographs,\" is considered a passive form of 3D scanning as it reconstructs a subject in 3D from 2D captured photos, using computer vision and computational geometry algorithms. This type of scanning is gaining traction because it doesn't require special hardware and can be run using just a smartphone. The idea here is to combine information from a range of photographs of a subject, taken from varying angles. The advantages of this technology are the speed at which scans can be completed, and the ability to capture colors and textures. This technology is particularly useful for large-scale scans, such as landscapes or large structures. The challenge is that the quality of the scan is dependent on the images captured, and given the enormous amount of data, it can be relatively slow depending on the hardware and software being used.\n\nAI & 3D Tailwinds\n\nArtificial Intelligence (AI) advances are expanding the capabilities and improving the ease of use for 3D scanning. AI can help align and merge multiple scans from different angles or sources to create a coherent and consistent digital model. It can also help classify and categorize scanned objects based on user-defined parameters such as shape or color, which could reduce the manual effort required to refine a model.\n\nFor example, considerable time and effort are often spent manually cleaning the data to create 3D digital images. After the 3D scanning data is collected into a \"point cloud,\" composed of millions of different data modules that may include color, texture, and intricate surface details. A point cloud that would take a person an hour to clean could be addressed in less than a second by AI.\n\nSoon, 3D scanners will be able to learn about and understand the objects they are scanning, allowing them to evaluate objects and provide more precise quality control. For example, a 3D scanner could assess the surface of a commercial plane, identifying areas that need immediate attention and those that can be addressed later, or as another example, it could be used to assess the structural integrity of buildings after an earthquake.\n\nLeading 3D Scanning Companies\n\n3D Systems (DDD) is a pioneer in 3D printing and offers 3D scanning solutions for product design, prototyping, and manufacturing. In 2021, the company acquired Oqton, whose cloud-based, AI-enabled Manufacturing Operating System is used to accelerate the deployment and automation of digital manufacturing in production environments.\n\nAutodesk (ADSK) is a software company serving industries in architecture, engineering and construction, product design and manufacturing, and media and entertainment. Autodesk software enables the design, modeling, and rendering needs of these industries. Its solutions include 3D scanning software and services.\n\nFaro Technologies (FARO) specializes in 3D measurement, imaging, and realization technology. It is known for its advanced 3D scanning equipment used in various industries, including manufacturing, construction, engineering, and public safety. Earlier this year, the company announced the release of Hybrid Reality Capture, which combines the accuracy of a static 3D laser scanner with the speed of a panoramic camera. This combination of fast scans with colorized 360° images improves scanning speed by up to 100%.\n\nHexagon AB (HXGBF) provides high-precision 3D scanners suitable for industrial and engineering applications. The company's unique portfolio of digital reality solutions combines its sensor, software, and autonomous technologies. Its subsidiary, Leica Geosystems, is a leading provider of premium spatial measurement solutions, including 3D laser scanners for surveying and construction.\n\nNVIDIA's (NVDA) Jetson mini supercomputer will help scanners understand and assess what they are scanning. This will expand the utility of 3D scanning beyond creating digital replicas and into functions such as quality control. Lumirithmic, an Imperial College London spin-out, has developed proprietary technology that enables users to easily create movie-grade avatars from facial scans, and enables 3D scanning at scale for any industry.\n\nTrimble (TRMB) offers 3D scanning solutions primarily focused on applications in construction, agriculture, transportation, and geospatial sectors. The company's Trimble Business Center (TBC) software uses AI to mimic human cognitive functions, such as classifying point clouds into buildings, vegetation (high and medium), poles, signs, ground, noise (people and vehicles), steps, power lines, and dividers.\n\nTopcon Corporation (TOPCF) provides surveying, construction, agriculture, and infrastructure management solutions, including 3D laser scanners and total stations.\n\nPrivately-held Artec 3D is known for its handheld 3D scanners, which are widely used in healthcare, industrial design, and media and entertainment.\n\nPrivately-held Creaform provides portable 3D measurement technologies and is known for its handheld 3D scanners used in industrial, educational, and research settings.\n\nThe views and opinions expressed herein are the views and opinions of the author and do not necessarily reflect those of Nasdaq, Inc.",

        "title": "3 \"Magnificent Seven\" Artificial Intelligence (AI) Stocks Will Leapfrog Apple to Join the $3 Trillion Club, According to 1 Wall Street Analyst | The Motley Fool",
        "body": "You're reading a free article with opinions that may differ from The Motley Fool's Premium Investing Services. Become a Motley Fool member today to get instant access to our top analyst recommendations, in-depth research, investing resources, and more. Learn More\n\nAfter turning in a dismal performance last year, the stock market has come roaring back, within striking distance of a new bull market. Helping fuel the market recovery is the viral excitement surrounding artificial intelligence (AI).\n\nThe list of this year's best performers is littered with companies best positioned to benefit from these next-generation algorithms. This includes the companies that make up the so-called \"Magnificent Seven\" stocks (as of market close on Wednesday):\n\nOf these, Apple deserves special mention as the first publicly traded stock on U.S. markets to reach a market cap the $1 trillion and $2 trillion benchmarks, and is currently the only one worth more than $3 trillion dollars. Despite being the first company to surpass each of these benchmarks, one analyst believes there will soon be a changing of the guard, with three of the Magnificent Seven stocks poised to leapfrog Apple's valuation in the coming years.\n\nThere's a compelling argument that the spark that lifted the market higher in 2023 is generative AI. These new AI models have the ability to generate original content and automate a broad cross-section of mundane and time-consuming tasks, improving processes and making workers more efficient.\n\nThe promise of these productivity gains has businesses scrambling to adopt AI to reap the expected financial rewards. Several companies at the forefront of AI have already staked their claim, making them frontrunners to steal Apple's crown.\n\nMicrosoft was arguably among the first to recognize the potential of generative AI. The company took a $13 billion stake in ChatGPT creator OpenAI early last year and quickly integrated productivity tools into Microsoft Office and its other software-as-a-service (SaaS) offerings. Copilot, the company's AI-powered assistant, offers hundreds of time- and work-saving features, including summarizing emails and drafting responses, creating presentations using provided data, writing and troubleshooting computer code, and even generating original content.\n\nAlphabet quickly jumped on the bandwagon, developing its Pathways Language Model (PaLM) LLM, which it says has the ability to \"understand, generate, and translate nuanced text -- including idioms, poems, and riddles -- across a wide variety of languages,\" which forms the foundation for its Bard conversational AI.\n\nAlphabet was also quick to integrate a wide range of AI tools into Google's most popular products and services, including Gmail, Google Docs, and Google Sheets, among others. Alphabet has since released Gemini AI, which Google says outperforms ChatGPT in 30 of the 32 most widely used performance benchmarks.\n\nWhile some market commentators cited Amazon for being late to the party, the company has made many of the most popular generative AI models available to Amazon Web Services (AWS) customers while also making a $4 billion investment in OpenAI rival Anthropic AI.\n\nThe company recently rolled out Amazon Q, an AI-fueled assistant focused on business use cases. Q helps employees with many of the same tasks as its rivals, summarizing documents and emails, searching corporate data banks, and submitting support requests.\n\nNeedham analyst Laura Martin posits that as the three largest cloud infrastructure providers, Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet are uniquely positioned to offer AI services to cloud customers, which will ultimately vault their market caps to $3 trillion. \"Generative AI will redefine the basis of competition for media and internet companies,\" she wrote in a note to clients.\n\nMartin went even further: \"Not only do [Microsoft, Amazon, and Google's] LLMs have the lowest cost structures and first-mover advantages, but their average lifetime value per Cloud customer is about to skyrocket owing to the stickiness of apps built on their LLMs,\" she said.\n\nThe numbers seem to bear out that opinion. It's estimated that 60% of all corporate data resides in the cloud, according to data compiled by Statista. Furthermore, 98% of corporations worldwide store at least some of their data there, according to cybersecurity solutions provider Check Point. AWS, Microsoft Azure, and Google Cloud control 31%, 25% and 10% of the market, respectively, according to data compiled by research firm Canalys. Given the vast reach of the big three, it's logical that they would be among the biggest beneficiaries of the AI revolution.\n\nThat's not to say Apple doesn't have much to gain from recent advances in AI, but the company's approach regarding how to deploy the technology will be different. Apple is more concerned with the continuing relevance of the iPhone and ensuring that its AI solutions further that goal.\n\nNo one knows for sure how far-reaching AI will ultimately be, but that hasn't stopped Wall Street's best and brightest from trying. Even the most conservative estimates are in the trillions of dollars, which makes it clear there will be many winners from the AI revolution.\n\nNot only are Amazon, Microsoft, and Alphabet using recent developments in AI to strengthen their primary business offerings, but they also stand to gain by delivering to a wide audience via their cloud infrastructure platforms.\n\nFinally, Microsoft, Alphabet, and Amazon are currently selling for 9 times, 4 times, and 2 times forward sales (as of this writing), making them relatively cheap when viewed in terms of the growing opportunity presented by AI.",

        "title": "The Vital Role of Detection Technology and Security Integrators in School Safety",
        "body": "There is an increasing recognition of the indispensable role safety measures and technology play in addressing school safety.\n\nConsidering the growing number of weapons-related incidents occurring at middle and high school athletic events nationwide, there is an increasing recognition of the indispensable role safety measures and technology play in addressing this pressing concern.\n\nThis not only provides an opportunity for security installers and integrators but also underscores a calling for them to actively contribute to the safety of educational environments.\n\nRecent events have highlighted the vulnerability of educational institutions to security threats. During the 2023 football season alone, there have been at least 16 shootings, resulting in two deaths and 13 people wounded at games across the country, K-12 School Shooting Database.\n\nMiddle and high school athletic events, along with campus settings, require comprehensive security measures to ensure the safety of students, staff and visitors. Traditional security approaches may fall short in addressing the evolving nature of threats, requiring a shift towards advanced, adaptable solutions.\n\nAs subject matter experts, security integrators play a vital role, particularly when addressing safety concerns at school campuses and athletic events. Educational institutions, from K to 12 school districts to high schools and middle schools, heavily rely on their security partners for knowledge, training and expertise in navigating available technology.\n\nThese professionals are instrumental in imparting their expertise, especially with the increasing emphasis on screening at scholastic athletic events. Integrators require the necessary knowledge to guide school districts in implementing effective safety measures and technologies, ensuring the well-being of students, staff, and attendees during such events.\n\nAs school districts seek to enhance safety at school athletic events, the consideration of specific technological advancements is crucial. While rapidly advancing technologies such as artificial intelligence (AI) exist, it's crucial to recognize their current limitations.\n\nOne notable challenge is AI's ability to accurately distinguish between threat items and non-threat items. Integrators and schools should recognize leading detection systems that prioritize accuracy, acknowledging that the effectiveness of security measures lies in the synergy of various elements.\n\nAdvanced threat detection systems, utilizing magnetic detection technology, exemplify this approach by providing a proactive means of accurately identifying potential risks, including knives and box cutters. This technology serves as an additional layer of defense, complementing existing security protocols.\n\nIntegrators should apply their expertise and proactively engage with critical technology providers and position themselves as key contributors to the technology decision process.\n\nEmphasizing a layered approach goes beyond technology and should include the implementation of comprehensive procedures and policies, including the clear bag policy and no reentry, among various measures. The integration of technology becomes most effective when it collaborates seamlessly with well-defined protocols, creating a robust security profile for school athletic events.\n\nIt is crucial for integrators to position themselves as experts within the school environment. To be genuine partners with educational customers, security installers must remain abreast of the latest technology trends and work closely with technology providers while thoroughly understanding the multifaceted security profile of school districts.\n\nThis holistic approach allows them to address all the distinct needs of educational institutions, elevating their role beyond specialization in one aspect to becoming indispensable partners in the overall safety framework.\n\nA critical best practice is to thoroughly understand the unique needs of the entire school district, recognizing that a one-size-fits-all approach does not suffice given the array of technological options available.\n\nThe highest priority is attributed to comprehending the customer's needs. Staying up to date with emerging technologies is key, particularly in addressing the often-neglected area of security around school events.\n\nThe challenge lies in balancing the need for heightened security with the preservation of a positive and open atmosphere in educational settings. Adopting a thoughtful approach that prioritizes efficient screening without causing unnecessary delays, thereby contributing to a positive atmosphere.\n\nAchieving this balance involves selecting technology that is both accurate and non-intrusive. This choice allows for a smooth flow into events while ensuring the capability to detect all potential threat items, ranging from large weapons to knives, box cutters, and even vapes.\n\nThe emphasis on a comprehensive approach to security technology enables these professionals to uphold safety measures without compromising the desired educational environment.\n\nCommunity involvement is crucial for addressing safety concerns at school events. Security integrators should play a pivotal role by engaging with the local community, especially at the school board level, involving all stakeholders in the conversation.\n\nThe dialogue spans from discussing the overarching need for enhanced safety to formulating effective strategies and policies, ultimately integrating technology into the comprehensive security framework.\n\nSecurity professionals foster community support through transparent communication and educational initiatives, clarifying the significance of security measures. Their contribution goes beyond implementation, involving ongoing conversations about the effectiveness of security policies.\n\nAs new measures are introduced, installers should actively participate in the rollout process, answering questions and providing insights. Being present during community discussions adds credibility, reinforcing the commitment to keeping events safe and ensuring the community is well-informed about the reasoning behind security measures.\n\nThis approach strengthens community ties and establishes a collaborative and supportive environment.\n\nComprehensive training for school staff, security personnel, and students is essential for ensuring a coordinated and effective response to potential incidents. Integrators should provide this training, recognizing that without it, new technologies and policies around school safety may falter.\n\nSuccessful initiatives involve on-site training sessions, not just on the technology but also on the concept of operations and screening protocols. Each district's unique space and venue considerations must be taken under account during the training process, ensuring that the best concept of operations is applied for the specific site.\n\nOverall, the collective efforts of security integrators, coupled with innovative technologies and collaborative practices, propel the advancement of school safety at events.\n\nThe layered weapons detection approach, combined with community engagement and ongoing training, establishes a comprehensive framework for safeguarding educational institutions and fostering a secure and positive atmosphere overall.\n\nChris Arbeitman is the vice president of market & business development for Metrasens.",

        "title": "From DIU '3.0' to classified leaks, to the Army network: 5 cyber stories from 2023",
        "body": "WASHINGTON -- Last year, the Pentagon made it clear that it would focus more on and invest in emerging technologies, namely artificial intelligence and machine learning, heading into the future. This year, that became clear with military services assessing how advanced tech could best be utilized and the Pentagon's innovation hub taking a more visible role across the department.\n\nAt the same time, the Pentagon is trying to address its cyber workforce shortfalls, particularly when it comes to retaining talent, through a new workforce strategy and implementation plan.\n\n[This article is one of many in a series in which Breaking Defense reporters look back on the most significant (and entertaining) news stories of 2023 and look forward to what 2024 may hold.]\n\n1. Under DIU '3.0,' innovation hub looks to take on more embedded role throughout DoD\n\nIn April, Doug Beck took over leadership of the Defense Innovation Unit and said it was at a \"tipping point\" heading into its next phase where it would focus less on proving new tech and more on scaling it for broad military use. Along with DIU's elevation to reporting directly to the secretary of defense and having a key role in the new Replicator initiative, the innovation hub is clearly getting ready to take on a more visible role across DoD. In an interview with Breaking Defense, Beck laid out how this \"pretty significant shift\" will impact DIU moving forward.\n\n2. Simplifying and streamlining: How the Army's new network boss aims to modernize\n\nMark Kitz, the Army's network modernization hub leader, told Breaking Defense how he was thinking of diversifying the service's investments to deliver a more flexible infrastructure to units while, at the same time, figuring out how to best leverage emerging technologies for future operations. In this story, Kitz, who is responsible for the massive task of modernizing the Army's tactical and enterprise network, identified some goals and objectives he hoped to accomplish in his new role.\n\n3. Zero Trust is the Pentagon's new cyber buzzword. It might not have stopped the Discord leaks.\n\nHundreds of \"sensitive and highly classified\" national security documents the government says were leaked online in March prompted an internal review in the Pentagon. The leak came as DoD publicly started pursuing zero trust -- a security standard that continuously authenticates a user's access to an organization's network.\n\nDoD leaders have been vocal about the need to implement a zero trust architecture and have outlined an ambitious timeline of implementing a baseline level of zero trust across the department by FY27. Defense officials told Breaking Defense why implementing zero trust standards was important, but experts noted that zero trust alone likely wouldn't have stopped the alleged leaks.\n\n4. JWCC, zero trust, user experience & a new cyber talent strategy: DoD CIO sets FY23 priorities\n\nDefense Department Chief Information Officer John Sherman set the tone early in the year in an interview with Breaking Defense where he revealed what his office would be focusing on in the year ahead. That included planning to award the first task order under its Joint Warfighting Cloud Capability and release new guidance for how DoD will get the best value for its dollar with the contract vehicle.\n\n5. How DoD is thinking 'outside the box' to solve its cyber workforce challenges\n\nAmong Sherman's many fiscal 2023 priorities was recruiting and retaining top-level cyber talent, with the latter being an area of weakness for DoD. In March, DoD finally released that strategy followed by an implementation plan, taking direct aim at the problem. In an interview, Mark Gorak, principal director for resources and analysis in the DoD CIO office, told Breaking Defense how the Pentagon was beginning to think outside the box to solve its challenges, namely working towards a much needed cultural shift that adopts some of the ideas of the commercial sector that competes with DoD for talent.",

Meanwhile, the Seeking Alpha authors' average rating is more positive with a Buy and the average Wall Street analysts' rating even more with a Strong Buy.",

        "title": "Micron Technology BrandVoice: AI: A Roadmap For A New World",
        "body": "We asked Sumit Sadana, executive vice president and chief business officer of Micron Technology, a few questions about the impact of rapid breakthroughs in artificial intelligence capabilities. Micron is one of three global memory companies -- and the only U.S.-based one -- operating at the scale required to deliver on AI memory demand. Sadana's comments have been lightly edited for length and clarity.\n\nLooking ahead to the next five to seven years, we can see that this progress is likely the most important technology trend for the world we live in -- and because its impact will be massive and pervasive, it can be called the most important technological development in the modern age, for all of humanity at large.\n\nOver the last three decades, enormous progress has been made in employing data and algorithms to help computers learn about how humans think. We call this artificial narrow intelligence, or ANI.\n\nWhile we don't completely understand how the brain works, we tried to mimic its capabilities through rudimentary algorithms, and we developed different techniques like machine learning, natural language processing and machine vision. These capabilities advanced the state-of-the-art of AI over the last three decades.\n\nThen generative AI burst onto the scene, via a breakthrough paper that was published on this topic in 2017. Gen AI is based on a transformer technology, which allows a sophisticated computer system and advanced algorithms to use large quantities of data (called large language models, or LLMs) to predict the next word in a sentence, all based on the context of the preceding words in the sentence or paragraph.\n\nAs the data models used to train these programs got very large, an interesting thing happened. With more data, the capabilities of the AI program started to improve exponentially. The program started showing capabilities that no one had thought possible. Not only was it able to show deep expertise in a lot of different areas, it was even able to create output that we traditionally have thought of as being very closely related to human intelligence. For example, the program was able to compose music and create art -- both areas linked to creativity that was earlier seen as the realm of what it means to be human. In addition, these programs started to show deep understanding of human psychology and even display humanlike emotions such as empathy.\n\nThere was a lot of excitement in the engineering community as these programs started to show the first glimpses of artificial general intelligence, or AGI.\n\nArtificial general intelligence refers to broad, humanlike intelligence, the ability to learn, to have intuition, to deal effectively with situations that the AI program has never previously encountered. In essence, it means that an AI program will function in ways that are largely indistinguishable from the abilities of a human being at the intellectual and reasoning level (not in terms of physical capabilities, of course). Researchers have long debated whether AGI was even possible, and before the advent of generative AI, even those who felt AGI capability was achievable thought that it was decades away. Now, many believe that we will have this capability perhaps within a decade.\n\nAll of this is made possible by massive amounts of GPU compute and massive amounts of memory. In fact, we are rapidly increasing the amount of memory in these sophisticated AI systems. Many people are surprised to learn that the silicon area dedicated to memory in these advanced AI systems is seven times the area of GPU logic in these systems.\n\nWe have only scratched the surface of delivering more powerful AI capabilities, and researchers already see fairly straightforward changes they can make, which will make the model 10 times smarter. And for reasons that researchers don't quite understand today, more data multiplies the level of intelligence beyond what linear extrapolation would suggest, so the trend for model sizes to increase will continue.\n\nIf we look out two to three decades into the future, I think not only is AGI possible, but we are likely headed into a world where we will be creating artificial super intelligence, or ASI. It won't happen for some time, but it is becoming a very real possibility in the next couple of decades, based on the stunning rate of progress we are making.\n\nOur brain has 100 billion neurons in it, which then support 100 trillion connections between these neurons. What you see in GPT4 today is only the outcome of approximately one trillion connections. GPT4, overall, already knows so much more than any human being does -- and it has learned this so fast and efficiently (when we look at it based on the number of connections). We have created a mechanism that, with only one trillion connections, learns in a way that is better than the human brain -- which we thought was the ultimate capability. Of course, the power consumed by the brain in its approach to learning is far superior to any data center, and this is one of the challenges we have to continue to work on.\n\nUltimately, we are headed into a world where the collective and cumulative wisdom of all of humanity will be contained within a data center. I'm not talking about all of humanity's data, or knowledge or insights, but all of humanity's wisdom, which is a much bigger deal than it sounds.\n\nThis is going to change everything about our world, our society, our work, our entertainment, our communications. With careful planning, coordination, focus on safety and appropriate regulations, this could become the ultimate example of technology really enriching life for all. There are also many challenges that this technology will create for society, and we have to be ready to deal with these proactively.\n\nAt the core of this AI transformation is Micron memory and storage technologies. The future of memory is extremely bright. And it is about more than the data center. Ultimately, this intelligence will become pervasive on end devices as well. You'll see artificial intelligence applications on your laptop and smartphone and even in other end devices, really everywhere in our lives.",

        "body": "After-hours movers: Costco gains following results, Lennar falls\n\nEasy credit software costs only a fraction of other credit repair companies from leaders of better credit\n\n, /PRNewswire/ -- E-Fix Credit, Inc., owner of software product DIY Credit Dr.â\"¢ today announced the release of its inexpensive credit repair software, which helps repair old credit issues and problems in order to raise credit scores. The company provides the best AI-powered credit report software for consumers. Through the use of artificial intelligence (AI), DIY Credit Dr. knows which accounts are hurting credit scores and helps consumers create powerful disputes to remove them.\n\nPremium Services from DIY Credit Dr. connect to the top three credit bureaus through smart importing. The software automatically imports the three bureau credit reports without creating a \"hard inquiry,\" which could create a flag on accounts.\n\nGood credit scores are vital. Scores help lenders assess the risk of lending money to an individual and determine the interest rates and contract terms offered. Payment history and how people use their credit affect credit scores. It is important to pay bills on time, as well as to keep credit card balances low. All of these can greatly improve a person's creditworthiness.\n\nDIY Credit Dr. provides professional letters users can send for a more direct and actionable method of contacting creditors. The software's letter generator helps create effective disputes suggested by consumer protection laws. DIY Credit Dr. uses this approach because letters are far more effective at permanently deleting disputes than online requests.\n\nUsers can track results through monthly credit reports, which tag which accounts were contacted and deleted, along with new credit scores. If inquiries on accounts are not deleted, DIY Credit Dr. will create a new strategy to initiate additional disputes.\n\n\"Credit repair companies have a history of charging a premium in order to help people clean up their credit,\" said the Owner and founder of DIY Credit Dr.â\"¢, . \"Now, with the power of credit repair software, AI is able to locate credit issues and help you remediate problems so you can raise your credit score. We created the software to help consumers repair their damaged credit and have more control over the process for a good deal less than what other credit monitoring companies charge for this service.\"\n\nFennell continued, \"Our pricing is minimal, saving you money and helping your cash flow. Our website provides the most up-to-date credit history and reporting statistics and gives you very helpful credit coaching videos. Now, you no longer need to spend hours studying your credit report or research how to delete accounts.\"\n\nThe company's video tutorial helps users understand what a credit score means and how it affects day-to-day finances, loans, bank accounts, mortgages, and credit cards. \"The guide breaks down the concept of credit scores, explains how they are calculated, and provides tips on improving and maintaining a good credit score,\" Fennell added.\n\nDIY Credit Dr. software includes credit monitoring. The company offers \"an arsenal of financial products to help people as they move forward with their credit journeys and gives you the support of our credit experts.\"",

        "title": "2023 Ad Agency Holiday Cards Lean on Artificial Intelligence",
        "body": "Other Christmas card efforts court holiday cheer, humor and charity\n\nAgencies have multiple ways of wishing their employees, clients and communities a happy holiday season. From kind donations to humorous cards and inventive ways of giving, agencies everywhere put their own unique stamps on the holidays.\n\nAdweek has gathered a few of these efforts, ranging from humorous to heartwarming and everything in-between. Of course, artificial intelligence is on everyone's mind, as it was last year, so some shops decided to address the big elephant in the room with their own AI attempts. Enjoy, and happy holidays to everyone from all of us at Adweek.\n\nZulu Alpha Kilo: \"Donation Dodgers\"\n\nOn the streets, most people dodge charity canvassers. Zulu Alpha Kilo made it worth the while of passersby to stop, giving them money just for being kind enough to talk with a canvasser. The point of the giving exercise was to tell people that kindness always pays, and the touching video displays that well. The video ends by saying that the Toronto-based agency, on behalf of its clients, partners and friends, made a generous donation to New York's City Harvest, The Greater Vancouver Food Bank and the Daily Bread Food Bank in Toronto.\n\nHavas Chicago partnered with nonprofit The Night Ministry to support unhoused Chicagoans. At first glance, the display mimics the traditional holiday shopping showcase, but upon closer inspection, it reveals a harsher reality, that over 68,000 are unhoused in the Windy City. The campaign invites everyone to give a gift that helps the city's most vulnerable neighbors access vital resources. The display is situated at 36 E. Grand Ave. in Havas Chicago's lobby.\n\nPMG: \"Can-struction\"\n\nPMG hosts an annual \"Can-struction\" competition across offices where teams are challenged to bring in donated canned goods and build something with them before they bring them over to the organizations. Dallas built a replica of Globe Life Park, London built Big Ben and Fort Worth created a museum.\n\nCancer touches everyone, and agency Real Chemistry is using AI-inspired technology for a holiday activation, \"Hopefall: A One-of-a-Kind Visualization of the Sound of Hope.\" Inspired by the symbolism behind a patient ringing the hope bell, the Real Chemistry team created a way to immortalize this moment forever using Cymatics to create \"soundflakes,\" where users can leave inspirational messages of hope and anecdotes about their own journeys as either a patient or caregiver.\n\n\"Feast Your Eyes\" is a holiday sweater generator made from prompts by users to \"knit\" a sweater with their food tastes. In the spirit of holiday giving, The Food Group will donate 10 meals to Feeding America for every sweater submitted, with a goal of donating 50,000 meals this month.\n\nTerri & Sandy: \"12 Days of Vasectmas\"\n\nTerri & Sandy sees the right to a safe, legal abortion as a crucial aspect of women's freedom and empowerment, so this year, the agency's holiday message is dedicated to the men of the world, because they have the power to impact our reproductive rights with a simple snip. The agency partnered with Ooze House of Music on the project, and it made a holiday donation to Planned Parenthood.\n\nTeam One: \"UnCringeMas\"\n\nWhile holiday caroling is a seasonal tradition, not every voice is fit for belting out a tune on pitch. Agency Team One has the solution. \"UnCringeMas\" is an AI harmonizer that allows users of all singing abilities to drop a pitch-perfect holiday song of their own. It was created in partnership with production studio PXP.\n\nThe M Booth \"Holiday Cardi\" builds personalized digital holiday sweaters. Powered by AI, guests fill out personal prompts about food, drink and animals to get a uniquely designed sweater that captures each user's seasonal favorites. Additionally, M Booth is taking the warmth that holiday sweaters bring in real life by donating to New York Cares to fund warm sweaters and coats for New Yorkers.\n\nAKQA: \"Fixmas\"\n\nAKQA celebrates renewal with Fixmas.gift, an environmentally conscious AI-powered, do-it-yourself assistant called Fixie, a one-stop solution for all things repair. The site hosts an array of guides and inspiration to empower people to prolong the lives of their belongings or purchase pre-owned items that need a little love and care. The AI repair bot is powered by iFixit and OpenAI.\n\nKettle, which is part of the Code and Theory network, decided to add AI to its holiday gift exchange. Instead of a traditional white elephant gift exchange, the experience design team at Kettle leveraged AI to match everyone up with the gift they would love. Their designs took the shape of Kai -- a gift-obsessed, neo-futuristic mouse that uses inputs offered by each employee.\n\nAI may be a powerful tool, but it's a long way from replacing good people. Barrett Hofherr's card features Midjourney's not-so-successful attempt to replicate the agency's partners, and reminds us that humans still reign supreme this holiday season.\n\nCoyne PR: \"(AI Holiday Tale)\"\n\nNew Jersey agency Coyne PR made a film with a man acting as an AI prompt while agency execs try to input the right terms to fit each employee. The agency calls it merging the magic of human creativity with the wonders of AI.\n\nPhiladelphia agency Brownstein is offering fun cocktail recipes with an advertising twist. Learn how to make everything from the Original Mad Man to the Under the Influencer and the FPO. Find the recipes here.\n\nBuffalo, N.Y., agency Crowley Webb is speaking to residents for the third year in a row through its annual holiday \"HolidAI\" billboard, which appropriately leans into this year's biggest trend. The billboard can be seen on Buffalo's Interstate 190 before Smith Street.\n\nAgency Hart wants people to share how they really feel about advertising, essentially, to \"Ad Vent.\" This new spin on advent calendars finds the agency counting down to the holiday break by sharing Ad Vents on Instagram every weekday through Dec. 22. Anyone can submit via DM on Hart's social channels.\n\nIndie agency Zambezi helped promote the brands it works with by sending out a holiday gift guide that is easily clickable and shoppable. The gift options range from Taylor Made golf products to Atlantis Bahamas reservations, Jinx jerky, Solo Stove, Traeger Grills and more. Each item was carefully selected to represent the quality and uniqueness of Zambezi's clients.\n\ncharlieuniformtango: \"Slay Ride\"\n\nDallas production house charlieuniformtango made a Christmas video featuring an all-women band and directing talent. The video is a nod to the music video style of the 1990s and the film Jawbreaker, a twisted tale of cruel high-school girls. All of the dialog for the video is pulled from Jawbreaker.\n\nMP&F: Holiday film\n\nNashville agency MP&F made a video that shows Santa learning new skills in his offseason at an agency and trying to adapt his unique skills to a non-Christmas environment.\n\nTrailerFarm: Retro gaming card\n\nAs a company working with clients in the gaming industry, TrailerFarm wanted to create a fun card combining its love of retro games and Christmas jumpers. The studio started by designing a physical card, which its in-house motion graphics team then animated. The short film shows Santa navigating his way to sending a festive message, fighting off a boss snowman in the process.",

        "body": "DENVER, Dec. 19, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Multi-cloud data services provider Faction announced today it has named Derek Pilling as its new CEO, following the completion of an acquisition and financing transaction sponsored by ORIX Corporation USA's Growth Capital group and Mr. Pilling's family investment firm, Tahosa Capital.

Pilling, who joined Faction as Chief Financial Officer in 2020, has worked for over thirty years with venture capital and private equity-backed companies, supporting successive generations of market leaders in technology-enabled services. As a result of the transaction, Faction has become an employee-owned and operated organization.\n\nData-driven businesses worldwide are rushing to modernize their data infrastructure in pursuit of business transformation outcomes, including making substantial investments in cloud-based artificial intelligence and machine learning.

The race to gain insights from data is pushing organizations to modernize their data architectures,\" said Pilling. \"They're realizing that the operational complexity and cost of consolidating, copying and moving data to the many destinations where it is used is expensive, time-consuming and ultimately, inhibits data-driven transformation. Businesses that modernize their data architecture with a data-first approach will accelerate their transformation efforts, gain better insights faster, and ultimately lead their market segments.\"\n\nFormer CEO Sean Charnock, who led the company for four years and through successful recapitalization, will complete a planned transition and continue to support the company as a member of the company's board. Founder Luke Norris will remain an advisor to the business as he pursues other startup business interests.\n\n\"The visionary data-first architecture we set out to create years ago aligns seamlessly to meet the current demands of organizations wanting to modernize their data architecture,\" noted Charnock. \"Derek's history with Faction and his ability to lead with the company to support organizations in unlocking the value of their data makes Derek the ideal choice to lead Faction into its next phase. The upcoming years will be an exciting chapter for the company.\"\n\n\"Derek has strong experience growing technology services companies with deep knowledge of the company and of the data infrastructure space, and we look forward to this next chapter for Faction under his leadership,\" added Jeff Bede, Managing Director and Head of ORIX USA's Growth Capital group. \"Faction's differentiated multi-cloud data services approach has the potential to drive significant growth for the company as they optimize their market opportunity in the larger data transformation ecosystem.\"\n\nAbout Faction\n\nSuccessful data-driven transformation requires a data-first approach to storing, managing and presenting data.

        "body": "Data Foundation and Deloitte survey finds that 95 percent of CDOs will consider implementing artificial intelligence technologies in the next year, but face several barriers to success - including resources, skill gaps, and a lack of authority.\n\nWASHINGTON, Dec. 19, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The Data Foundation, in collaboration with Deloitte*, unveiled the 2023 Federal Chief Data Officer (CDO) Survey, which found that federal CDOs made much progress advancing data culture, governance, and analytics goals, but still experience consistent challenges accessing adequate resources, staff skills, and authorities.\n\nThe 2023 Federal CDO Survey also found that CDOs plan to embrace artificial intelligence (AI) platforms and other emerging technology in 2024. In order to successfully leverage these cutting-edge technologies, federal CDOs say they need more clarification from agency leadership about their roles and responsibilities.\n\n\"CDOs are making tremendous progress in better using data, often that the government has been collecting from the American public for years,\" said Nick Hart, President of the Data Foundation. \"CDOs are key partners for program managers and the American people to enable data to be valuable and used, but CDOs also need the resources, guidance, and authority to ensure their role can effectively achieve the vision of the Evidence Act and be a core agency function.\"\n\nThe report on the survey, Enabling Mission Success: A 2023 Survey of Federal Chief Data Officers, offers insight into the evolving role of the federal CDO since the implementation of the Foundations for Evidence-Based Policymaking Act, including the factors that enable and hinder CDO missions. Survey topics included organizational structure, resources, professional experience, CDO mission, collaboration, organizational strategy, challenges and guidance related to the CDO community, and the CDO role in emerging technologies.\n\n\"The 2023 Federal CDO survey underscores the continued expansion of the federal CDO role, including the critical function that federal CDOs play in their agency's efforts to successfully adopt and implement AI technologies,\" said Adita Karkera, Chief Data Officer for Deloitte's government and public services practice. \"Our survey also finds that providing federal CDOs with more resources and authorities can help agencies maximize the use of data to improve the delivery of important government services for people and families across the country.\"\n\nKey findings from the 2023 Federal CDO Survey include:\n\nThe report includes four recommendations for the CDO community, including related to clarifying CDO authorities, training, resources, and ethical guidance for AI use.\n\nThe recommendations and full report on the 2023 Federal CDO Survey are available on the Data Foundation website.\n\nAbout Data Foundation: The Data Foundation is a national non-profit organization that champions the use of open data and evidence-informed public policy to make society better for everyone. We are the trusted authority on the use of open, accessible data to fuel a more efficient, effective, and accountable government; spark innovation; and provide insights to the country's most pressing challenges.

        "body": "DENVER, Dec. 19, 2023 (GLOBE NEWSWIRE) -- Multi-cloud data services provider Faction announced today it has named Derek Pilling as its new CEO, following the completion of an acquisition and financing transaction sponsored by ORIX Corporation USA's Growth Capital group and Mr. Pilling's family investment firm, Tahosa Capital. ORIX USA's Growth Capital group extended new capital to Faction in support of the company's growth and expansion plans. Pilling, who joined Faction as Chief Financial Officer in 2020, has worked for over thirty years with venture capital and private equity-backed companies, supporting successive generations of market leaders in technology-enabled services. As a result of the transaction, Faction has become an employee-owned and operated organization.\n\nData-driven businesses worldwide are rushing to modernize their data infrastructure in pursuit of business transformation outcomes, including making substantial investments in cloud-based artificial intelligence and machine learning. Compatible with existing cloud and on-premises investments, Faction's patent protected Multi-Cloud Data Services provide the only data-first architecture for the public cloud, enabling the presentation of a single data store to applications and cloud-based services running in and across multiple hyperscale public clouds. Faction solutions enable data-driven businesses to run workloads across multiple public clouds, select the best cloud services and applications for each workload's requirements, and reduce data storage costs by obviating the need to keep multiple copies of data.\n\n\"Data-driven transformation requires a data-first architecture for the public cloud. The race to gain insights from data is pushing organizations to modernize their data architectures,\" said Pilling. \"They're realizing that the operational complexity and cost of consolidating, copying and moving data to the many destinations where it is used is expensive, time-consuming and ultimately, inhibits data-driven transformation. Businesses that modernize their data architecture with a data-first approach will accelerate their transformation efforts, gain better insights faster, and ultimately lead their market segments.\"\n\nFormer CEO Sean Charnock, who led the company for four years and through successful recapitalization, will complete a planned transition and continue to support the company as a member of the company's board. Founder Luke Norris will remain an advisor to the business as he pursues other startup business interests.\n\n\"The visionary data-first architecture we set out to create years ago aligns seamlessly to meet the current demands of organizations wanting to modernize their data architecture,\" noted Charnock. \"Derek's history with Faction and his ability to lead with the company to support organizations in unlocking the value of their data makes Derek the ideal choice to lead Faction into its next phase. The upcoming years will be an exciting chapter for the company.\"\n\n\"Derek has strong experience growing technology services companies with deep knowledge of the company and of the data infrastructure space, and we look forward to this next chapter for Faction under his leadership,\" added Jeff Bede, Managing Director and Head of ORIX USA's Growth Capital group. \"Faction's differentiated multi-cloud data services approach has the potential to drive significant growth for the company as they optimize their market opportunity in the larger data transformation ecosystem.\"\n\nAbout Faction\n\nSuccessful data-driven transformation requires a data-first approach to storing, managing and presenting data.

But the assessment found that China, Russia, Iran and Cuba all tried to meddle in congressional elections in 2022.\n\nThe intelligence community assesses with high confidence that China \"tacitly approved efforts to try to influence a handful of midterm races involving members of both U.S. political parties\" - likely as part of a broad series of directives by Chinese Communist Party leaders since 2020 to \"intensify efforts to influence U.S. policy and public opinion in China's favor.\"\n\nChina intensified its efforts to heighten sociopolitical divisions, according to the assessment, but still focused more on efforts to support or undermine a small number of specific candidates based on whether Beijing perceived their policy positions to be in its favor.

        "body": "Council Created to Bring Value to the Healthcare Industry by Fostering Collaboration to Solve Revenue Cycle Challenges\n\nDOWNERS GROVE, Ill., and NASHVILLE, Tenn., Dec. 19, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- The Healthcare Financial Management Association (HFMA) and XSOLIS, the artificial intelligence (AI) technology company creating a more efficient healthcare system, announced today the creation of the Executive Revenue Integrity Council. The goal of the new council is to create a forum for leaders to address revenue cycle and reimbursement challenges, developing best practices through networking and education.\n\nThe Executive Revenue Integrity Council gives provider and payer leaders the opportunity to work together to develop solutions to systemic issues that create unnecessary costs and inefficiencies in the payment integrity process.\n\n\"In today's resource-constrained environment for hospitals, financial executives are poised with unique if not unprecedented opportunities for improvement,\" said HFMA's senior vice president of professional practices, Richard L. Gundling, FHFMA, CMA. \"When leaders collaborate successfully, they can develop better ideas and solutions than they might have alone. We, with the support of XSOLIS, are excited to connect leaders from some of the country's most preeminent hospital systems and health plans to help elevate the health sector's thinking and practices. The expertise and collective value this group can bring will be invaluable in solving some of the healthcare industry's most costly challenges.\"\n\nIn its 2023 Outlook Survey Report, HFMA respondents cited staffing issues and funding sources as their top two professional challenges for the year. In addition, prior authorization, government relations and payer relationships remain top of mind for healthcare financial leaders according to Becker's Hospital CFO Report. HFMA recognizes the growing need to bring provider and health plan organizations together to work toward solving shared challenges and inefficiencies.\n\nRevenue integrity executives from leading health systems and health plans across the U.S. are in a unique position to address these issues as part of the Executive Revenue Integrity Council. The following provider organizations have signed on to participate to date, and additional health plan recruitment to the Council is underway. Current participants include:\n\nXSOLIS brings its knowledge in fostering collaborative provider and payer relations and will contribute funding to the initiative as part of the company's ongoing commitment to addressing meaningful and solvable problems in healthcare administration.\n\n\"We are honored to lead this important initiative alongside HFMA,\" said Joan Butters, co-founder and CEO of XSOLIS. \"Administrative waste costs healthcare greatly, and at least $15 billion could be saved by improving provider and payer communication and creating more opportunities for alignment with decision-making. By strengthening the ability to solve shared problems, health systems and health plans are able to continue focusing on providing high-quality care.\"\n\nThe first Executive Revenue Integrity Council meeting will take place virtually in February of 2024. After the initial meeting, the Council will meet twice yearly as well as additional meetings throughout the year, including two stand-alone in-person meetings in conjunction with HFMA events, two web discussions and ongoing online forum discussions.\n\nTo learn more and to apply to join the council, click here.\n\nAbout Healthcare Financial Management Association\n\nThe Healthcare Financial Management Association (HFMA) equips its more than 110,000 members to navigate a complex healthcare landscape.

        "title": "Human Interaction in Customer Service Still Preferred Despite Technology Innovations, New Research Finds",
        "body": "After-hours movers: Costco gains following results, Lennar falls\n\nNew Cogito survey finds 46% of consumers prefer to speak to a human agent, but are comfortable with AI-assisted human interactions\n\nBOSTON--(BUSINESS WIRE)-- Cogito, the leader in real-time AI coaching and guidance for the enterprise, today announced survey results that reveal insights into how consumers prefer to interact with human agents and artificial intelligence (AI) technologies to manage their customer service issues. Focusing on support issues related to the Black Friday and Cyber Monday shopping weekend, the new report confirms the need for companies to balance AI and automation capabilities with human interactions to deliver strong customer experiences (CX).\n\nFor most consumers, itâs not a question of if they will reach out to customer support channels, itâs a matter of when, where, and how. More than half (53%) of consumers stated they prefer to chat with a live agent via the telephone when it comes to complex customer service questions or issues, while only 17% would prefer to use technology like live chat via a website or mobile app.\n\nWhen it comes to interacting with AI for customer service inquiries, nearly half (46%) of consumers surveyed would prefer to speak to a real human but feel comfortable if the agent is using AI in the background to improve the interaction. This data confirms that, while enterprises who donât take advantage of AI are leaving opportunities and revenue on the table, itâs important to implement the technology strategically. The goal is not to replace agents but rather, empower and inform them with tools and data insights to improve customer service interactions.\n\nâWe are increasingly learning from our customers that 2024 will be about consolidating costs and driving revenue. The first effort to do so is to augment, rather than replace, the agentâs role by integrating AI into existing workflows,â said Josh Feast, CEO and co-founder of Cogito. âItâs validating to see consumers agree with this notion â\" wanting to keep the human touch in the contact center but with the agent using technology to ensure theyâre delivering the best service and CX possible.â\n\nThe stakes to get the CX right are high, with 76% of consumers surveyed stating a negative customer service experience would impact them choosing a brandâs products/services in the future, with 61% saying theyâd consider other brands first, and 15% saying theyâd never be a customer again. As AI continues to revolutionize contact center operations, itâs important to balance the human and AI approach to better meet these high customer expectations.\n\nCustomer Preferences: Humans and TechnologyÂ\n\nThe immediate future of the contact center is not robots, but AI-assisted human interactions. When implemented effectively, these interactions create a win-win-win situation. Customers receive the benefit of a more informed agent to resolve issues faster; agents are empowered to be more effective in their jobs leading to less turnover and better employee experiences; and lastly, enterprises win with reduced operating costs, improved productivity, and lower customer and employee attrition rates. Contact center leaders should keep these consumer insights in mind to fully understand how customers prefer to engage with humans and technology, and how AI can be used to bolster agent-customer interactions.\n\nRegardless of brand or industry, every customer interaction is critical to an organizationâs bottom line. Contact center leaders need to ensure they have the tools and technologies in place to meet and exceed expectations. While it can be daunting, it often doesnât require a complete overhaul of contact center operations but rather, looking for incremental opportunities to integrate AI capabilities into existing workflows. For example, by integrating powerful Emotion AI and Conversation AI, agents can receive real-time guidance to improve their performance, while still prioritizing the human touch for a better overall customer experience.\n\nMethodologyÂ\n\nThe online survey, which was completed by 1,000 18+ U.S. adults, was commissioned by Cogito and fielded by Dynata, a global market research firm, in December 2023. For more information or results, please contact [email protected].\n\nTo learn more about how AI solutions can improve contact center operations by elevating agent and customer experiences, visit Cogito Conversation and Emotion AI.\n\nAbout CogitoÂ\n\nCogito innovates with emotion and conversation AI to deliver real-time coaching and guidance to contact centers and frontline teams.

        "title": "Council Post: How To Utilize Intelligent Search For Supply Chain Optimization",
        "body": "Daniel Fallmann is founder and CEO of Mindbreeze, a leader in enterprise search, applied artificial intelligence and knowledge management.\n\nIntelligent search, especially when paired with generative AI, can help companies optimize supply chain processes.\n\nIntelligent search, for example, can swiftly sift through vast amounts of data, providing real-time insights. This is particularly crucial in the supply chain, where the slightest delay and undiscovered bottlenecks can have cascading effects.\n\nBy leveraging intelligent search and machine learning algorithms, companies can streamline their operations, identify bottlenecks and make data-driven decisions on the fly. In this article, let's explore how generative AI is impacting intelligent search and the supply chain before I share some insights into what companies should know to succeed with the implementation of intelligent search tools.\n\nGenerative AI enhances intelligent search capabilities by analyzing historical data and predicting future trends and challenges. This kind of predictive analytics empowers companies to proactively address issues before they escalate.\n\nRecommendation engines powered by AI play a pivotal role in organized and effective inventory management. By understanding past consumption patterns, current market trends and even external factors -- like weather or geopolitical events -- intelligent systems can suggest optimal inventory levels, minimizing excess stock and stockouts. This reduces costs and enhances customer satisfaction by ensuring products are consistently available.\n\nFurthermore, natural language processing (NLP) capabilities within intelligent search systems enhance communication and collaboration. This is beneficial in a globalized supply chain where diverse languages and communication styles may pose challenges. NLP facilitates seamless interactions, improving coordination among stakeholders and minimizing the risk of miscommunication.\n\nTo see this more clearly, consider a global electronics manufacturer implementing intelligent search and generative AI in its supply chain operations. Here are a few use cases that they can now develop to better understand the state of their supply chain:\n\n* Predictive Maintenance: Which machines are slowing down and going to minimize our output if not addressed? Generative AI allows manufacturers to predict maintenance needs for their machinery with minimal effort by the worker.\n\n* Demand Forecasting: AI systems generate accurate predictions of future demand by analyzing historical sales data, market trends and other relevant factors. This permits the company to optimize inventory levels, balance supply and demand and minimize excess stock or shortages.\n\n* Procurement: Integrating intelligent search with generative AI also facilitates supplier relationship management. Companies can identify top-performing partners by monitoring supplier performance and detecting potential risks early on. This proactive approach enables organizations to build robust and reliable supplier networks.\n\nAs companies embrace this technology, it's essential to consider the importance of successful implementation.\n\nFirst and foremost, investing in employee training is crucial. Additionally, companies should prioritize data security and privacy. With the vast amounts of sensitive information involved in supply chain operations, robust cybersecurity measures are imperative. This includes implementing encryption protocols, regular security audits and staying on top of the latest developments in cybersecurity.\n\nBeyond these factors, implementing intelligent search and generative AI in supply chain operations involves several key steps:\n\nCompanies should start by thoroughly assessing their existing supply chain processes, identifying pain points and evaluating the areas where AI can bring value. Planning involves setting clear objectives and defining key performance indicators (KPIs) that the implementation aims to improve.\n\nCompanies must collect historical and real-time data from various relevant sources, including suppliers, production systems and market trends. Integrating diverse data sources into a unified platform is essential for the effectiveness of intelligent search and generative AI algorithms.\n\nChoose or develop AI solutions that align with the identified objectives. This could involve selecting or building intelligent search systems, recommendation engines and generative AI models tailored to the specific needs of the supply chain.\n\nTrain the AI models using historical data. Generative AI models may require supervised learning to understand patterns and make accurate predictions. Integrate the trained models into existing systems, ensuring compatibility and smooth interaction with other technologies in the supply chain ecosystem.\n\nConduct rigorous testing to evaluate the performance of the implemented AI solutions. This includes assessing accuracy, responsiveness and the ability to provide actionable insights. Iterate on the models based on the testing results, refining algorithms to improve performance and address any unforeseen challenges.\n\nImplement systems for continuous monitoring of AI performance. Regularly update algorithms and models to adapt to evolving market conditions and ensure long-term effectiveness.\n\nOnce the initial implementation proves successful, consider scaling the use of intelligent search and generative AI to additional areas of the supply chain. This could involve expanding the scope to include more suppliers, additional production lines or broader logistics networks.\n\nBy following these steps, companies can strategically integrate intelligent search and generative AI into their supply chain operations, unlocking efficiency gains and improving overall agility in response to dynamic market conditions.\n\nIn conclusion, the synergy between intelligent search and generative AI can reshape the supply chain landscape. Companies that embrace and effectively implement these technologies stand to gain a competitive edge by fostering a more agile, efficient and resilient supply chain. With the right strategies in place, businesses can navigate the complexities of the modern market with confidence and precision.\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives.

Pools are separated by gender, and no clothes are allowed inside them.\n\nSpa World offers gift cards and a selection of Groupons starting at $35 for a one-day general admission. Make sure to read our Groupon gifting tips at the bottom of this article.\n\nCollege Park Aviation Museum: Air travel obsessives of all ages would love access to this gem in College Park. Memberships range from $25 and up. All include unlimited free admission, discounts on special events and more; the $50 flight pack is probably best for families because it admits six people.\n\nNational Aquarium: Visit our friends under the sea as much as your want for a year at the aquarium in Baltimore. Memberships range from $95 (individual) to $300. Note that admission is free for kids 4 and under.\n\nNational Building Museum: Members get free admission to exhibits showcasing the wonders of design and architecture, such as the Brick City LEGO one, and discounts to special events.

Parking passes are part of membership at tiers $92 and above.\n\nSpy Museum: A $199 membership gets unlimited access for two adults and up to five children to the museum near L'Enfant Plaza. The museum is best for visitors aged 9 and older, but the family tour lays out options for younger kids.\n\nSubscriptions to theaters not only support the arts but allow your giftee to take a chance on a show they might not have seen otherwise.\n\nMany D.C.-area theaters offer subscriptions, but here are some stand-out options.\n\nArena Stage: Shows including \"Swept Away\" and Step Afrika!'s holiday step show are part of subscription packages of three or four plays. They cost $181-$349 depending on the seat quality and your days. You can even pick out some shows you think your giftee will love, and they can do fee-free exchanges and easy rescheduling if that date doesn't end up working.\n\nThe Kennedy Center: Subscription packages allow you to pick a genre, including theater, dance, jazz, the National Symphony Orchestra and performances for young audiences, and get tickets to a series of shows. Because of the unlimited no-fee ticket exchanges, you can surprise your giftee but allow them the flexibility to switch to dates that work for them. A Kennedy Center membership comes in handy when trying to get competitive tickets, too. And just in time for the holidays, Disney's \"Frozen\" is playing through Jan. 21.\n\nKennedy Center gift certificates and regular memberships, starting at $75 per year, are also available.\n\nWolf Trap: The performing arts venue in Vienna offers memberships from $50.

Tickets start at $37; a gift card is probably the best way to gift this experience.\n\nGet Air: The trampoline park in Alexandria offers annual memberships starting at $159.99 for kids taller than 46 inches, but you'll need the slightly pricier Ultimate Membership to get unlimited two-hour jump sessions on weekends.\n\nLaunch: Kids bouncing off the walls? That's the whole point at this trampoline park with an arcade, ropes course and laser tag at Launch, which has locations in Capitol Heights, Maryland, and Herndon, Virginia.

The e-vouchers get your two tickets and allow flexible scheduling.\n\nYou can, of course, buy tickets or a gift card on each team's website, but here are some other giftable options from D.C.'s pro teams:\n\nNote: The Washington Commanders main option is gift cards as their season winds down. Washington Mystics season tickets will go on sale once the 2024 schedule is released. Washington Spirit and DC United only have season tickets on sale while waiting for soccer season to kick off.\n\nTop Golf: Does your giftee want to work on their swing? Platinum Memberships for 1-2 people start at $100 for a month, $420 for six months or $720 for a year at the Gaithersburg locations. Other local outposts include National Harbor and Ashburn. You can ask your local location about discounts for first responders, teachers, military members and health care workers.\n\nKraken: Pickleball and roller skating are great ways to get active when it's cold outside.

Their Bryant Street location is the only indoor roller skating in D.C.\n\nRock climbing: Sportrock Climbing Centers in Sterling has a good Groupon for an introductory class (ages 14+ only), and the discount website has other climbing offers, as well!

A single-seat subscription starts at $29.99 for one movie every day. Gift cards are also available.\n\nLandmark Theatres: Aficionado Tickets are a pack of 25 tickets for $225. At $9 per ticket, you can give out single tickets as a stocking stuffer or delight one person with a whole lot of screen time.\n\nRegal: The theater chain offers gift cards for three months or a year of its Unlimited subscription plan.\n\nGroupons are an easy way to gift experiences and save some dough. Their website has a guide to purchasing them as gifts.\n\nBut there are a few more important ways to get it right. Here are our tips:\n\nRead the fine print: You want a Groupon that allows flexible booking. Does the Groupon offer a good selection of dates, ideally for at least a few months? Are weekends included? Ideally, the answer to these is yes. Also look for restrictions on age and other factors.\n\nCheck the location: Your giftee will appreciate something that's a short drive or easy transit trip from their home - unless you're also gifting them a ride, or you KNOW they've been desperate to, for example, go skydiving in Midland, Virginia.\n\nListen to your gift recipient: If someone is afraid of heights, skydiving obviously isn't a good present. On the other hand, if they've been talking about their neck pain, a massage could be incredibly thoughtful.\n\nRead reviews: If you're not familiar with the provider of an experience, check the Groupon reviews and look up the business on another website or two.\n\nConsider gratuity and tax: Groupons to spa services, restaurants and the like don't include tips, and it's good etiquette to tip for the full value of the service even if you got it for a steal. Depending on your giftee's financial situation, consider slipping a cash for a tip into their card. Tax is also not included on some Groupons.\n\nWant to know what's up for your weekend?

        "title": "What you missed at DALI Naples: Awarding this year's outstanding superintendents",
        "body": "Superintendent Alex Marrero of Denver Public Schools took home the award for Superintendent of the Year.\n\nWhen asked to think outside the box and interpret what hands-on inquiry, a proven learning method to boost student engagement and understanding, means to them, superintendents slit the Lego bags open and poured into the blocks. In no other room in America were adults working as seriously on building with Legos as at this conference breakout session; it was so quiet, you could head a pin -- or, in this case, a Lego, drop.\n\nAt the final DALI Summit this year at the Naples Grande Beach Resort in Florida, superintendents seamlessly shifted gears between commiserating with fellow district leaders and getting down to business to identify, diagnose and provide solutions to some of their most top-of-mind issues. Whether in a focused learning session or during a lunch break, the wheels spun passionately.\n\n\"You all know how difficult the role is, but we all have our challenges and our strategies, and we're trying to do our best for students,\" said Jose Dotres, superintendent of Miami-Dade Public Schools and Leader of Distinction awardee.\n\nAt DALI's inaugural Awards of Distinction ceremony, superintendents and district leaders across the nation celebrated their colleagues' biggest accomplishments over the past year.\n\nAmeca Thomas, superintendent of Laurens County School District 55 (S.C.), was awarded a Districts of Distinction award in the College and Career Pathways category for helping students enrolled in a pathway program achieve a 100% graduation rate. Alex Haltom, Director of Innovation, Technology, and Media Services for Hemlock Public School District (Mich.), received a Leader of Distinction award for ensuring students' access to WiFi away from campus.\n\nAnd Superintendent Alex Marrero of Denver Public Schools took home the award for Superintendent of the Year. Since assuming the position in 2021, Marrero has struck a deal with union bargaining groups to ensure a $20 minimum wage by 2025, and the graduation rate has increased by a district-high 2.5%. The DPS leader also guided his district through a school shooting that claimed one student's life and injured two administrators.\n\nMarrero turned to the crowd of superintendents, a position that continues to garner turnovers en masse, and addressed the challenge of making high-level executive decisions.\n\n\"There's not many of us. There are a lot of fallen soldiers,\" Marrero said. Then, quoting Richard Carranza, former chancellor of the New York City Department of Education: \"You have to do your job even if it leads to you losing your job.\"\n\nMore from DA: Latest school closures force leaders everywhere to make tough choices\n\nSuperintendents and other district leaders covered a lot of ground together, exploring topics such as artificial intelligence and live learning. However, some topics seemed universal.\n\nTeacher recruitment and retention tended to dominate the conversation. Cherie Washington, Chief of Student Support Services at Fort Worth Independent School District (Texas), described it as a staffing crisis that goes beyond employing teachers. Washington, who also won a Women of Distinction award, suggested forging stronger assistant principal-principal pipelines.\n\n\"We have to really focus on how we are going to recruit and retain great teachers, and I think that also spills over into administration,\" she said. \"We focus on the principals, but as they leave, are we focused on preparing our next leaders?\"\n\nIn New York City, teacher hiring has returned to pre-COVID levels, but it's still attempting to rebound from a falling retention rate. Kelly Shannon, deputy superintendent of District 2 of New York City's Department of Education, discussed the importance of supporting teachers across multiple dimensions. Leaders need to ensure teachers are working in a healthy culture and climate, provide individualized mentorship opportunities, and support veteran teachers as much as their new ones, she said.\n\nSuperintendents also grappled with methods to keep students engaged and involved in school amid rampant absenteeism. One method leaders discussed was creating more intentional and exciting before and after-school programs to limit students' distractions.\n\n\"Above all else, parents want their kids to belong,\" said Dawn Bridges, vice president of educational affairs at Right At School. \"Districts need capacity-building partners who can help build aftercare and enrichment programs.\n\nMaura Horgan, superintendent of Newark City Schools (Ohio) and Women of Distinction awardee, has long been a proponent of developing STEM-focused afterschool programs to boost student engagement and camaraderie.\n\n\"If you're not intentionally trying to make progress, you're working in a vacuum,\" she said.\n\nPatrick Wnek, executive director of the North East Florida Educational Consortium, finished tooling together his Lego sculpture, emblematic of hands-on student inquiry. At first, embarrassed by the challenge, it reminded him of the chance students and leaders take every day to learn -- and to lead.",

        "title": "Advancing Product Quality",
        "body": "FDA is engaged in efforts to encourage innovations in manufacturing processes and technology and to foster a quality management system.\n\nFDA meets early with companies developing technologies that may offer significant improvements to pharmaceutical quality and provides recommendations to help support technology development and implementation and anticipated applications. The Emerging Technology Team has considered a wide range of new technologies such as continuous manufacturing, 3D printing, Process Analytical Technology, distributed manufacturing, and artificial intelligence.\n\nCenter for Drug Evaluation and Research (CDER) is preparing a regulatory framework to support the adoption of advanced manufacturing technologies that could bring benefits to patients. Based on engagements through the Emerging Technology Program and elsewhere, the FRAME initiative prioritized four technologies: End-to-End Continuous Manufacturing, Distributed Manufacturing, Point-of-Care Manufacturing, and the use of Artificial Intelligence in manufacturing.\n\nFDA engages foreign regulatory counterparts to coordinate on ways to advance product quality. For example, we work with the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) to develop harmonized quality standards and facilitate implementation by industry. FDA is a member of the Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/S), which is an international organization dedicated to harmonizing inspection practices and related policies. FDA has also engaged in initiatives such as the Mutual Recognition Agreement to utilize inspectional observations from capable regulatory authorities, reduce duplicative efforts, and focus resources and inspections on facilities that pose the greatest risk. In addition, the FDA is promoting engagement with global regulators under the International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities (ICMRA) forum, which is comprised of 28 regulatory authorities from around the globe.\n\nIn June 2017, CDER and Office of Regulatory Affairs (ORA) established a ConOps to integrate facility evaluations and inspections for human drugs. See our Q&A page for additional details about how this collaboration will improve consistency, efficiency, and transparency for facility evaluations, and inspections, and regulatory actions.\n\nCDER is establishing a program to promote quality management maturity (QMM) at drug manufacturing establishments. CDER is developing its QMM Assessment Tool (protocol and rubric) to evaluate how effectively establishments monitor and manage quality and quality systems. The QMM program aims to encourage drug manufacturers to implement quality management practices that go beyond current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements.\n\nFDA requires all drug manufacturers to monitor quality and drive continuous improvement. FDA's quality metrics webpage provides background on the FDA's efforts to initiate a voluntary reporting program that can provide key metrics to the FDA.",

        "body": "The WPT World Championship event is down to six tables and 45 players from a field of 3,835 entries. The World Poker Tour's record-breaking No-Limit Hold 'em tournament with a $40 million prize pool enters Day 5 on Tuesday, Dec. 19 and plays down to the final table on Wednesday. The TV Final Table begins at 4 p.m. Pacific Time on Thursday, Dec. 21 where the final six players will earn between $1.2 million and $5.6 million for first place.\n\nCanadian Mark Mounsey leads with 18,725,000 chips, but five other players have more than 16 million in chips with blinds at 100,000/200,000 and a $200,000 big blind ante in Level 27. Mounsey's best live tournament cash is just under $3,400, as he pursue's a poker player's dream with a deep run in the WPT Championship.\n\n\"I'm feeling pretty good, considering I made it in on a satellite.\"\n\nAll 45 players remaining will win at least $111,000. The TV final table of 6 players will all become millionaires with the winner also earning an entry into the 2024 WPT World Championship.\n\nThe WPT World Championship Festival has been a huge success in its second year partnering with Wynn Las Vegas. The opening $600 event drew a massive field of 4,950 entries and a $2.5 million prize pool. Other tournaments have been popular with the featured $2 million Mystery Bounty, $5 million WPT Prime, $40 million WPT World Championship and the high-roller Big One for One Drop adding to the record turnout.\n\nAmong those still remaining in the $10,400 entry WPT Championship event are past WPT Champions Chris Moorman (10.2 million chips), Roberto Romanello (4 million) and two-time WPT Champion Alex Foxen (4.4 million), who spiked a ten on the turn for a set of tens to stay alive against a pocket pair of jacks with both players all-in pre-flop in Day 4.\n\nAlex was joined by his wife, poker pro Kristen Foxen (10.3 million), at the WPT featured table late in Day 4 with both players advancing to Day 5.\n\nAlso, Princess Love (3.6 million) is enjoying the thrill of making a deep tournament run after learning how to play poker less than one year ago. The reality TV star from 'Love & Hip Hop' fame is providing her 3.8 million followers on Instagram, and amateur poker players around the world, added excitement with poker's popularity and her guaranteed six-figure score.\n\nSame for Andres Campero (5.1 million), who has already turned a freeroll and $55 satellite into more than $111,000 after he won his way to Las Vegas via a freeroll on WPT Global. Campero has a PhD from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology - MIT - in Brain and Cognitive Sciences and Computer Science and Artificial Intelligence Laboratory.\n\n\"I played a freeroll where I won a $55 ticket to a step satellite. I won a $220 (ticket) and then I won that $220 (satellite) - only one player won. So that was fortunate and that's why I'm here.\"\n\nAnd that's what tournament poker is all about. The stories, social and game experiences, and a big poker payoff.\n\nDay 3 chip leader Artur Martirosian (11.2 million) is still in contention and in 11th chip position into Day 5 Tuesday. However, there are four players with larger chip stacks at his table to start Day 5.\n\nOther past WPT Champions who made a deep run into Day 4 before busting out include Alessio Isaia, Jack Hardcastle, Ben Palmer, Vitalijs Zavorotnijs and Davidi Kitai. Last year's WPT World Championship main event winner Eliot Hudon ($4.1 million) finished in the top 5 percent of the 2023 field and cashed for $27,000 in 189th place.\n\nWPT ambassador Brad Owen cashed for $53,500 on Day 4 with his JJ in the small blind all-in for 2.1 million over a bet and 3-bet button raise. But the big blind pick up pocket kings (KK) and knocked out Owen in a heads-up hand for nearly $5 million in chips. Owen finished 35th and cashed for $99,000 in last year's WPT World Championship inaugural event at Wynn Las Vegas.\n\nAmong other notables and highlights deep into Day 4 was WPT Co-Founder Lyle Berman. The 82-year-old from Minneapolis made a prolific run in the 2023 WPT World Championship and finished in 89th place for a $47,100 score.\n\n\"When we first founded the WPT, me and Steve Limpscomb, I didn't think, '20 years from now, it would still be going, and not just strong, but stronger than ever,\" Berman said on Day 4.\n\nThe final table of the WPT Prime Championship will play down to a winner on Tuesday, Dec. 19 with the TV Final Table starting at 4 p.m. PT and also live-streamed. The 10,516 entries made the $1,100 buy-in event the single largest live WPT-branded tournament field of all time, with a prize pool of $10,196,640. The winner of the No-Limit Hold 'em tournament will earn the top prize of $1,386,280.\n\nFormer WPT Player of the Year Mukul Pahuja finished in seventh place to set up the TV Final Table.\n\nAfter a 5 year hiatus, the Big One for One Drop tournament has made it's return in WPT style. Day 2 of the $1 million entry is Tuesday and the TV Final Table is Wednesday, Dec. 20. A star-studded field of super high-stakes players take aim at a $7.1 million top prize. The field of 17 players includes the who's who of elite high roller poker players headlined by 10-time World Series of Poker bracelet winner and past WPT champion Phil Ivy. However, Ivy was one of the first players to bust out and will not appear in his 10th WPT final table.\n\nThe tournament chip leader into Day 2 is Dan Smith, who has $3.68 million from a starting chip stack of $1 million. Smith and Fedor Holz (630,000 chips) both cashed in the 2018 Big One for One Drop, taking third ($4 million) and second place ($6 million) respectively.\n\nIsaac Haxton, who has earned more than $15.5 million already this year to top the 2023 Money List, sits at $1.16 million chips into Day 2. Jason Koon, a 3-time WPT final table participant, has $1.02 million chips.\n\nFollow all the World Poker Tour events and major tournament final table action from luxurious Wynn Las Vegas - a Forbes Five Star Award-winning resort - as the WPT Championship Series events continue to build poker's popularity.",

The ministry from which the secretary hangs, that of Digital Transformation, has pointed out that she is leaving the position \"by her own decision\" after \"doing a fantastic job for four years.\"\n\nArtigas reported her departure at an event organized by Expansión on AI and new technologies, the last one in which she will participate as Secretary of State, she stated. She held the position since 2020 and is a recognized expert in AI, big data and technological innovation, with almost 30 years of experience. She co-founded and directed Synergic Partners, acquired by Telefónica in 2015, and has also held various positions in the public sector and private companies.\n\nThe Catalan has thanked the Minister of Digital Transformation, José Luis Escrivá, for the trust placed in her after reaffirming her in the position to be able to finish the stage of the Spanish presidency of the European Union (EU), which ends on December 31.\n\nOne of the main objectives during the EU presidency was to reach an agreement for the future regulation on artificial intelligence, which is expected to be officially published next May after intense negotiations that culminated at the beginning of this month. An agreement that establishes the first rules with which to limit the risks of artificial intelligence.\n\nArtigas, 55, has assured that he leaves with the feeling of a \"job well done\" after a period of almost four years in this public position, in which he highlighted that \"Spain has been positioned internationally\" in the field digitization\n\nAnother of the great milestones during Artigas' mandate has been the creation of the National Agency for the Supervision of Artificial Intelligence, whose headquarters will be located in A Coruña.\n\nOn the other hand, Artigas was selected by the UN last October to co-chair the new supervisory body for artificial intelligence and the still Secretary of State has indicated that \"it is something that is going to keep me quite busy until September, and I am going to give myself \"a time to re-plan my return to the private sector.\"\n\nArtigas said that his time as Secretary of State and public administration has been \"one of the great satisfactions\" of his life. \"We have to reclaim the power of public management, there is nothing better than working for the public management of your country,\" he noted.",

        "title": "Council Post: How AI Can Drive Business Growth By Accelerating Process Automation",
        "body": "Alessio Alionço is the founder and chief executive officer of Pipefy, a global leader in workflow automation solutions.\n\nSeventy nine percent of business and IT leaders expect to see efficiency gains of at least 25% from the fusion of AI and process automation, according to a recent survey conducted by my company. That's huge, especially in terms of what that means for enterprise growth and cost optimization. But what shape will these new gains in efficiency and productivity take? According to the survey of those business leaders:\n\nIt's clear that business leaders see the business benefits of applying AI to process automation. And while these individual anticipated benefits are good news for business operations, it's also critical to consider what they mean for business strategy. The picture becomes clearer when we sort these benefits into three primary categories: process optimization; faster access to data; and improved user experiences.\n\nArtificial intelligence (AI) makes it possible for teams to build the best version of any process in a matter of seconds. These new processes are constructed by AI from inputs and requirements defined by the user. These inputs can then be supplemented with data from existing processes. AI then takes this information and transforms it into a structured, efficient process.\n\nFor example, let's say the IT team gets a request to build an approval process for the procurement team. Users can tell the AI what phases or activities need to occur, who needs to be involved and what kinds of rules apply to the new process. AI then takes these parameters and constructs an optimized process that can be implemented as-is or fine-tuned as needed.\n\nThis reduces the burden of manually building processes from scratch, which can reduce the burden on teams who manage many different processes that may change often as business strategies or internal requirements evolve.\n\nI believe another important impact of AI on process automation will be its effect on decision making. Every business depends on data-driven decisions to inform, execute and assess its overall strategy. AI will play a pivotal role in decision making by collapsing the distance between data access and data analysis.\n\nWhat does that look like? One common challenge, regardless of industry, department or team, is getting access to reliable data quickly. AI can dramatically reduce the time it takes to gather and organize crucial data -- users simply have to ask for it. Let's say the procurement team needs to understand average lead time or see how often invoices are being paid past due. By simply framing their query to an AI chatbot, they can have that data in a matter of seconds; there's no need for spreadsheets or manual data gathering.\n\nBut AI can also deliver more sophisticated data analysis helping teams spot trends, detect anomalies and uncover root causes. All of which can be essential for defining strategy, staying agile and evaluating success.\n\nIn addition to creating more efficient processes and enabling data-driven decisions, I find that AI will transform user experiences. AI will do this in a couple of ways. First, generative AI provides a single-entry point from which users can access all kinds of data, documents and information. In this way, AI provides a centralized portal from which users can take action and access information, without having to switch apps or spend time hunting for what they need.\n\nThink about the typical experience for an employee who is ready for a vacation. To do this, the employee will need to consult the company policy on PTO, check their available time off balance and then submit a vacation request to their manager. If their HR team uses a solution with generative AI, the employee can complete all these actions from a single starting point: an AI chatbot.\n\nAI complements and enhances process automation initiatives, but it's important for any company considering this option to think about what they hope to gain and how they will measure their success, before implementing it. Key metrics to monitor include:\n\n* Impact on SLA lead times\n\n* Productivity, as in the number of requests served per IT headcount\n\n* Average time it takes to deploy a new workflow\n\n* The number of workflows being created by non-technical users\n\n* Increase in the number of IT deliveries to the business line\n\n* Decrease in the size of the backlog\n\n* Reduction in costs resulting from errors, manual work, missed deadlines, etc.\n\nTo make it a smooth transition for employees, leverage the user-friendly and intuitive options for AI. With these, users can submit a question or request to a chatbot using natural language, and the chatbot can retrieve, organize and deliver the information or action requested.\n\nBest practices for successful implementation for AI and process automation also include developing and delivering structured training for the entire company, with training that is tailored for each department or team. This can ensure that employees get the most out of their AI by leveraging all its features and capabilities. AI is quite powerful. Companies can potentially maximize their ROI by preparing all employees to engage with it fully by applying AI to their specific processes and workflows.\n\nAll the benefits of combining AI with process automation -- more efficient processes, better decisions and improved user experiences -- are valuable in and of themselves, but they are also a means to an end. Business leaders should take note of their potential impact on business strategy. Each plays a key role in supporting enterprise growth and cost optimization. They do this by enhancing efficiency, driving new productivity gains and eliminating the process friction that can complicate strategy planning and stymie its execution.\n\nForbes Business Council is the foremost growth and networking organization for business owners and leaders.

        "body": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has huge potential to advance the field of health and medicine, but the nation must be prepared to responsibly harness the power of AI and maximize its benefits, according to an editorial by Victor J. Dzau and colleagues. In addition to addressing key issues of equity across the innovation lifecycle, the authors argue that the scientific community must also decrease barriers to entry for large-scale AI capabilities and create dynamic, collaborative ecosystems for research and governance. The authors include suggestions for how the scientific community can tackle these challenges: First, advancing AI infrastructure for data, computation, health, and scale, in order to democratize access to both research and outcomes. Second, creating a flexible governance framework to ensure equity, prevent unintended consequences, and maximize positive impact. Third, building international collaborative efforts to efficiently expand scope and scale and to effectively address research questions of key interest to the global community. The National Academies are capable of playing a key role by convening stakeholders, enabling cross-sectoral discussions, and providing evidence-based recommendations in these areas, according to the authors. To see the ultimate vision of AI in health and medicine realized, the authors conclude, the scientific community must expand current capacity-building and governance efforts to successfully construct a strong foundation for the future.\n\nCredit: Photo by National Academies of Sciences, Engineering, and Medicine Artist-in-Residence Christopher Michel",

        "title": "Council Post: 20 Ways Technology Can Further Diversity And Inclusion Efforts",
        "body": "Entities ranging from businesses to schools to nonprofit agencies are striving to build and support efforts toward better diversity and inclusion. These organizations not only seek to offer more opportunities for people with varied backgrounds, experiences and abilities to participate, but also to ensure the services they offer meet the needs of everyone in the community.\n\nWhile this is decidedly a person-first endeavor, artificial intelligence and other technology tools can help bridge certain gaps and improve essential efforts. From enabling communication to helping all of us see the world in different ways, below, 20 members of Forbes Technology Council discuss how technology can support diversity and inclusion efforts.\n\nImplementing AI-driven language translation tools fosters inclusivity by breaking down language barriers to communication across diverse teams, educational settings, healthcare services and social initiatives. This ensures everyone can participate and benefit, regardless of linguistic differences. - Mohit Gupta, Damco Solutions\n\nTechnology can foster diversity and inclusion by providing platforms for virtual collaboration and communication, enabling organizations to connect with a global workforce. This enhances cultural exchange and understanding, encourages varied perspectives and supports flexible work arrangements, making organizations more accessible and inclusive for individuals from diverse backgrounds. - Miguel Llorca, Torrent Group\n\nForbes Technology Council is an invitation-only community for world-class CIOs, CTOs and technology executives. Do I qualify?\n\nAI has the potential to unlock powerful healthcare solutions that could harness the data and information that currently overload health systems, helping clinicians \"cut to the chase\" with preventative and personalized care pathways. However, this can only happen if AI is built with solid foundational data and without the systemic biases that prevent inclusion. AI built on solid data is a game-changer for health equity. - Brad Porter, Orion Health\n\nData and analytics enable organizations to curate extremely large and diverse datasets. A data asset that includes a myriad of sources, both internal and external, creates a richer foundation that's more comprehensive and representative of society. In healthcare, a curated data asset can thwart bias by ensuring the data used in decision-making includes information on an accurate patient population. - Michael Meucci, Arcadia\n\nData analytics can help organizations understand how well they're doing on diversity and inclusion efforts by drilling into data in multiple ways. Instead of just overall numbers, dive into the details by department, by role and by salary level. What are the demographics of applicants, interview candidates and actual hires? True diversity and inclusion should be visible in all roles and levels. - Ann Westerheim, Ekaru\n\nTechnology is essential to diversity, equity and inclusion efforts because it can be used to provide empirical evidence that a particular issue exists. DEI initiatives are often perceived as superfluous virtue-signaling, but there is no better evidence to combat this potential misconception than quantifiable metrics demonstrating how solving a particular issue contributes to improved morale and positive business outcomes. - Ikechi Okoronkwo, Mindshare\n\nAlthough technology can potentially exacerbate bias, it can also potentially be used to empower organizations to uncover and address unconscious biases. In the healthcare sector, AI can be used to uncover bias in areas including hiring and patient scheduling, fostering learning and reflection that can drive a more equitable and inclusive environment as well as improved access for patients. - Salim Afshar, Reveal HealthTech\n\nTechnology can help organizations support diversity and inclusion efforts by enabling more inclusive recruitment practices and facilitating remote work. This opens up access to a diverse pool of candidates and collaborators, promoting diversity and inclusion. - Jean-Baptiste Coger, Plato\n\nCultural and structural inertia have been among the top barriers to supporting D&I efforts. One way to address such inertia is to use AI for policy analysis and improvement. Analyze existing policies and practices to identify areas that may hinder diversity and inclusion. AI can suggest improvements or highlight successful practices from other organizations, fostering a more inclusive environment. - Abhishek Kaushik, WeCP (We Create Problems)\n\nThis may seem counterintuitive, but AI has immense potential to reduce bias. For example, AI can recognize career patterns and pinpoint when a job applicant has an incorrect or misleading job title. It's well-documented that women and people of color receive fewer promotions. AI can instantly level the playing field by allowing recruiters to look at skills, capability and experience rather than a dusty old job title. - Joanna Riley, Censia Talent Intelligence\n\nDistance-based engagement has already changed education and healthcare. As wearables for healthcare continue to improve and there is increased adoption of telemedicine, those who may not have had the ability to engage will be on a level playing field with those who do -- creating a bridge for diversity, equality, inclusion and accessibility. - Sean Barker, cloudEQ\n\nDiverse perspectives foster a dynamic workforce and drive success for an organization. Physical barriers may have previously stifled a company's ability to embrace diverse perspectives, but technology has enabled learning and collaboration in an equitable and inclusive environment. By leveling the playing field, organizations can tap into the entire knowledge base of their organization. - Mike Lefebvre, SEI\n\nAppropriate internal collaboration platforms, backed by executive support, are crucial for advancing diversity, equity and inclusion in organizations. These platforms facilitate the creation of employee resource groups and diverse communities, promoting idea sharing and mutual support. Such a strategic approach enriches workplace inclusivity, ensuring that diverse voices are valued. - Raj Polanki, Wacker Chemical Corporation\n\nBlockchain allows for global participation, enabling diverse groups to collaborate and contribute equally to various projects and initiatives. Moreover, blockchain facilitates more inclusive financial services. This can be particularly beneficial for marginalized groups, ensuring they have equal access to financial services and rights. - Alexei Dulub, PixelPlex\n\nI see encrypted data analytics as a key tool for enhancing DEI. By securely analyzing sensitive data, organizations can uncover essential insights into DEI initiatives without compromising confidentiality. This approach not only respects privacy, but also drives informed decisions, helping organizations bridge gaps in areas including pay equity and healthcare delivery, ultimately fostering a more equitable society. - Ryan Lasmaili, Vaultree\n\nIn healthcare, advances in natural language processing have made it possible to make more accurate clinical decisions by bridging the gap between structured and unstructured data. This enables healthcare professionals to weigh factors outside of billing codes and medications, taking into consideration social determinants of health that often have a greater impact on marginalized populations. - David Talby, John Snow Labs\n\nTechnology is essential for increasing information availability and educational access. Online platforms provide learning options independent of location or financial status. Accessibility democratizes education, empowering individuals from diverse backgrounds to gain knowledge and expertise, thus opening opportunities and facilitating remote and adaptable work environments. - Dax Grant, Global Transform\n\nMixed reality technology can enhance diversity and inclusion efforts by simulating the experiences of visually impaired individuals. How can we understand the perspective of a person who is visually impaired? We can do so through an empirical experience of their perspective. Mixed reality can greatly increase empathy for those with physical impairments. - Robert Strzelecki, TenderHut\n\nGlobally, there are 70 million people with hearing impairment who communicate by signing, and people who are deaf face significant employment challenges across the world. AI holds immense promise for this underrepresented and often marginalized community. AI has the ability to translate sign language by converting signs into spoken words and vice versa. This impacts the lives and work of many by creating a more inclusive form of communication for all. - Jeff Wong, EY\n\nBusinesses can rely on AI tools to analyze and filter language online -- for example, on social media or student communication platforms. The system can detect hateful comments through keywords and delete them, as well as block the user or send a warning. As a result, organizations can promote a welcoming and inclusive environment where every user feels safe. - Yuriy Berdnikov, Perpetio",

        "title": "Council Post: 20 Nonprofit Experts Share Trends To Watch In 2024",
        "body": "With the end of the year fast approaching, many nonprofits are already deep into planning and executing initiatives for Q1. In addition to set goals giving teams an idea of what to work toward, examining the market for emerging trends can help ensure a nonprofit organization is moving in the right direction to best meet the needs and expectations of constituents.\n\nBelow, 20 Forbes Nonprofit Council members share upcoming trends nonprofits should be ready for in 2024.\n\nNonprofits need to invest in tech to support their strategic growth in 2024. This can include adopting tools for virtual collaboration, harnessing the power of data analytics for informed decision making and embracing digital marketing strategies to reach a wider audience. Tech will play a pivotal role in ensuring a nonprofit's adaptability, resilience and success in an ever-changing landscape. - Debora Wondercheck, Arts & Learning Conservatory\n\nNonprofits need to be ready for all permutations of generative AI and machine learning in 2024. The stakes for getting AI governance right are high, so organizations should be thinking now about how to navigate policies for its responsible use, both for internal and external audiences. There is a way to begin to govern AI right now, and it does not have to depend only on the government. - Eric Reicin, BBB National Programs\n\nForbes Nonprofit Council is an invitation-only organization for chief executives in successful nonprofit organizations. Do I qualify?\n\nIn 2024, nonprofits must embrace generous listening, which is crucial in the era of rising AI. Prioritizing generous listening in the face of technological advancements ensures that automated solutions align with diverse community needs, fostering harmonious integration and preserving the irreplaceable human touch in nonprofits. - Vuslat Doğan Sabancı, Vuslat Foundation\n\nResonant storytelling involves sharing the impact of your work on people's lives. Specifically, it's sharing stories about how your work confronts inequity and creates a tangible path forward to improved outcomes in your community. People are overwhelmed with stories of political polarization, AI, inflation, etc. Consider what stories will cut through the noise and inspire people to engage with you. - Caroline Whistler, Third Sector Capital Partners\n\nDonors are demanding tangible impacts from their contributions, pushing nonprofits to prove results and the effective use of resources. This trend necessitates investing in comprehensive evaluation and impact assessment systems to build trust and and retain the continued support of stakeholders. - Mike Shaver, Brightpoint (formerly Children's Home & Aid)\n\nOne trend to watch in 2024 is the increase in pressure to provide more services to members. Juggling member needs and wants with nonprofit bottom lines will be challenging, especially since much of the demand relies on expensive technology and people balk at passing on costs to members. - Deb Callahan, National Fenestration Rating Council\n\nAs 2024 unfolds, nonprofit organizations should expect potentially lower fundraising dollars with interest rates being raised to curb inflation woes. To mitigate this, campaigns must engage younger generations who potentially have higher disposable income and significant passion for social causes. - Dr. Cinque Parker, Marie Aline Gay Heart for Haiti Foundation\n\nIn 2024, expect the continued rise of donor-advised funds or DAFs, which offer tax benefits to donors. They're convenient for donors but do bring both benefits and challenges for nonprofits, including stable funding with barriers like visibility, unpredictability and competition. Nonprofits must adapt their strategies and comply with various DAF sponsor rules to attract more donors who have DAFs. - Ted Hart, CAF America Donor Advised Funds\n\nThe greatest asset of the nonprofit sector is trust. While trust in corporations, government and more has plummeted, it remains strong for nonprofits. To protect trust, nonprofit leaders must proceed carefully with new tools like AI. An inauthentic thank you letter written by chatbot or a security breach by an AI data screening service will undermine trust in the affected organization and the entire sector. - Laura MacDonald, Benefactor Group\n\nThe implementation of artificial intelligence is already in many workplaces, so nonprofits need to prepare for how to best use AI and how to protect their organizations from misuse. The positive aspect is that using AI can speed up certain administrative, fundraising and creative functions. The negative aspect is that its use should be closely monitored to ensure accuracy and authenticity. - Kimberly Lewis, Goodwill Industries of East Texas, Inc.\n\nCollaboration is a trend that funders are increasingly focused on. More importantly, it's good for our constituents. By working together, we can eliminate redundancies for the people we serve, raise more awareness and work more effectively. Nonprofits must genuinely consider how to approach their peers for meaningful partnerships. Additionally, these organizations must be ready to demonstrate impact on the collective ecosystem level. - Rosie Cunningham, Family Reach\n\nNonprofits should be ready for the positive trend of influencers taking their marketing outreach game to the next level. It's like having a superhero squad to amplify your reach, connect with diverse demographics and spin authentic stories that resonate with hearts across social media. Some organizations have already tapped into the power of influence, and 2024 will see its use scale. - Nick Lynch, Collidescope IO, Inc.\n\nThe competition for talent in the nonprofit sector will most likely continue into 2024. Many organizations are currently understaffed or have vacant positions they cannot fill. Nonprofits need to become more comfortable exploring staffing alternatives, such as outsourcing and fractional staffing, in order to secure the skills and expertise they need to build out infrastructure for success. - Victoria Burkhart, The More Than Giving Company\n\nThe prices of everything -- housing, food, transportation, childcare, you name it -- are increasing at dizzying rates. Many nonprofits operate on very tight budgets and already pay less than for-profit peers. Taking deliberate action to ensure salaries rise along with the cost of living is especially critical to maintaining a healthy organizational culture and continuing mission fulfillment. - Josephine Faass, Robert Schalkenbach Foundation\n\nThe demand for remote work options will continue into 2024. Dispersed work environments bring benefits, including flexibility for staff, decreased overhead costs and the ability to find the best staff wherever they may be based. These environments also bring challenges in building culture, communicating and managing projects. To meet this expectation, nonprofits must celebrate the pros while safeguarding against the cons. - Patricia McIlreavy, Center for Disaster Philanthropy\n\nI want to join the chorus on AI, but I also want to ensure nonprofits are ready with cybersecurity measures and training in place. Cyberattacks are increasingly targeting smaller organizations, so organizations need to invest in training their staff and reviewing their cyber protocols and insurance, especially in the age of AI. - Erin Mote, InnovateEDU\n\nIn 2024, nonprofits must embrace digital fundraising and transparency. Robust data analytics are vital for showcasing impact. Diversity, equity and inclusion are non-negotiable. Navigating evolving regulations is crucial for staying compliant and retaining trust. Success hinges on adapting to a digitized, transparent and socially conscious landscape. - Steven Rhines, Noble Research Institute\n\nOne trend nonprofits should watch in 2024 is greater support for innovation efforts. The world is currently dealing with vast geopolitical volatility, being behind in delivering against the UN Sustainable Development Goals at the halfway stage and the ongoing impact of a pandemic and wars on the most vulnerable. Within this context, it's important to recognize that more of the same won't address the greatest challenges of our time and to advocate for adjusting philanthropic efforts to back innovation. - Jonathan Prosser, Compassion UK\n\nNonprofits must prepare for continued polarization and unrest due to ongoing global conflicts, political dissension, elections, inflation, high-interest rates, plus more unknowns to come in 2024. Take a leadership role by staying positive, encouraging your supporters to come together, issuing a unifying rallying cry and accelerating your mission to help more people who will need it this upcoming year. - Jean Accius, CHC: Creating Healthier Communities\n\nChallenges and opportunities in the communities nonprofits work alongside are more nuanced and complex than a few years ago. Fundraising has bright spots, like major donors, and challenges, like declining grassroots giving and less trust. Leaders need to find space for strategy, ideation and feedback. Success in 2024 is going to be defined by your willingness to learn. - Matthew Gayer, Spur Local",

Based on engagements through the Emerging Technology Program and elsewhere, the FRAME initiative prioritized four technologies: End-to-End Continuous Manufacturing, Distributed Manufacturing, Point-of-Care Manufacturing, and the use of Artificial Intelligence in manufacturing.\n\nFDA engages foreign regulatory counterparts to coordinate on ways to advance product quality. For example, we work with the International Council on Harmonisation (ICH) to develop harmonized quality standards and facilitate implementation by industry. FDA is a member of the Pharmaceutical Inspection Co-operation Scheme (PIC/S), which is an international organization dedicated to harmonizing inspection practices and related policies. FDA has also engaged in initiatives such as the Mutual Recognition Agreement to utilize inspectional observations from capable regulatory authorities, reduce duplicative efforts, and focus resources and inspections on facilities that pose the greatest risk. In addition, the FDA is promoting engagement with global regulators under the International Coalition of Medicines Regulatory Authorities (ICMRA) forum, which comprises 28 regulatory authorities from around the globe.\n\nIn June 2017, CDER and ORA established a ConOps to integrate facility evaluations and inspections for human drugs. See our Q&A page for additional details about how this collaboration will improve consistency, efficiency, and transparency for facility evaluations, inspections, and regulatory actions.\n\nQuality management maturity (QMM)\n\nCDER is establishing a program to promote quality management maturity (QMM) at drug manufacturing establishments. CDER is developing its QMM Assessment Tool (protocol and rubric) to evaluate how effectively establishments monitor and manage quality and quality systems. CDER QMM program aims to encourage drug manufacturers to implement quality management practices that go beyond current good manufacturing practice (CGMP) requirements.\n\nQuality Metrics\n\nFDA requires all drug manufacturers to monitor quality and drive continuous improvement. FDA's quality metrics webpage provides background on our efforts to initiate a voluntary reporting program that can provide key metrics to the FDA.",

        "body": "Kura's ultra-high performance multimodal AI and augmented reality platform transforms how humans learn, communicate, live and work\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 19, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Kura, a pioneer and leader in generative multimodal AI and widest-FOV augmented reality technology, today announced that the company has been recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Award honoree for its AR glasses. The award recognizes the product's custom AI framework and powerful developer tools that provides an unrivaled user experience.\n\nThe annual CES Innovation Award program recognizes outstanding design and engineering in consumer technology products. This year's CES innovation Awards program received a record-setting number of more than 3,000 submissions and is one of the most respected and renowned awards for frontier electronic devices. This is Kura's second CES honor.\n\n\"This is yet another significant milestone in Kura's journey, and this honor highlights our drive to integrate powerful artificial intelligence models with augmented reality to enhance our users' lives,\" said Kelly Peng, Founder of Kura. \"Imagine a powerful AI virtual assistant that follows you wherever you go, recognizing real-world objects and actions, and interacting with you in a very natural way -- that's what Kura will provide.\"\n\nTo date, Kura has met significant milestones, achieving an industry record 150-degree field-of-view with the Kura glasses and has provided demos to hundreds of users and professionals. Kura's product is enabled by Kura's customized design silicon -- through a partnership with TSMC (the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer) -- and world's first AI-generated optical design software, built by an in-house team led by Kura co-founder Bayley Wang, who worked on the world's first GPU-accelerated AI optical design tool at MIT.\n\nKura is also in the process of developing a multimodal AI platform and APIs which combine visual, voice, motion, and gesture inputs to augment users' workflow and activities. Kura currently supports general and domain-specific questions, real-time information retrieval and generation using large language models, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG), a technique which combines a fast and referenceable vector database with an LLM. With real-time visuals from the built-in camera system, imagery can also be used as part of the prompt.\n\n\"The Kura glasses see what the user sees, hear what they hear, and can act as an extension of human working memory and senses. What makes Kura different is that humans get about 80% of learning and input from visuals, and all AI software and applications are competing for the user's mobile and computer screen times these days,\" said Chuck Alger, Kura General Manager and former member of the Microsoft Hololens and Microsoft Surface teams. \"We're bringing AI from the era of phones without screens to today's modern age. Most AI wearables are simply like a speaker and microphone without a display, which is a good data collection device, but not effective at providing private input and instructions for complex tasks. Thanks to augmented reality, we can use an overlay to point out objects or places in the real world, dramatically enhancing the user experience.\"\n\nKura's glasses also dramatically outperform competing augmented reality products, offering best-in-industry field of view, transparency, resolution, and brightness, all in a compact form factor that is comfortable to wear daily. With a robust set of use cases -- from travel and entertainment to manufacturing, training, and even law enforcement -- the Kura glasses represent a major milestone in augmented reality and artificial intelligence.\n\n\"There's simply no other device on the market that offers 150-degree field-of-view, 95% lens transparency, and 8K resolution, especially in a form factor that mimics a pair of eyeglasses,\" said Gregory Gallinat, Chief Operations Officer of Kura and consumer electronics industry veteran. \"Our team boasts decades of experience in consumer technology, and it's an honor to be recognized by the Consumer Technology Association for developing these breakthroughs to supplement the user experience.\"\n\nSince its founding, Kura has received overwhelming demand, with orders and contracts from over 400 companies and government agencies worldwide, and is actively working with leaders in industrial manufacturing, automotive design, law enforcement, travel, and entertainment.\n\n\"Kura's vivid, immersive, and clear images enable broad use cases for product design, training, production, and visualization,\" commented SAIC Ventures, the venture branch of SAIC Motors, one of the world's largest automotive manufacturers, who is also an strategic investor in Kura. \"Enterprises in automotive and other manufacturing industries will benefit greatly from these new possibilities.\"\n\nTo learn more, please visit kura.tech.\n\nAbout Kura\n\nKura, headquartered in Silicon Valley, is building the world's most powerful augmented reality glasses and telepresence platform from the chip level up, and creating multimodal interactive AI for real-world applications. Founded by seasoned industry veterans and MIT alums, Kura's industry-leading technological solves the biggest industry adoption bottlenecks, and paves the way for broad use cases across a wide range of industries and disciplines to augment fundamental human capability, learning, communication, and productivity.

        "title": "AI-enhanced low-light photography coming to Galaxy S24 Ultra",
        "body": "Samsung's Galaxy S24 series may use artificial intelligence (AI) to improve low-light photography, at least the Ultra model. The phone can reportedly identify a dozen different kinds of objects in Night Mode images captured with the 200MP primary camera and optimize them for better quality. It is unclear whether the company will offer the same AI optimization capabilities on the other two Galaxy S24 models.\n\nThe Galaxy S23 Ultra is one of the best camera phones you can buy today. It delivers excellent overall camera performance, including low-light photography. Samsung is keeping the 200MP camera unchanged on the 2024 model. Coupled with improved software processing, the new Ultra flagship is already expected to go up a notch over its predecessor with its image quality.\n\nIt appears the Korean firm will add AI to the mix. Noted Samsung insider Ice Universe says the Galaxy S24 Ultra will use AI to detect 12 kinds of objects in a scene when capturing photos in low-light environments. It will then optimize the scene to add more details and make the image look better. The phone will likely enhance colors, tone, and dynamic range to improve the overall quality of the photo.\n\nThe source didn't specify what objects the Galaxy S24 Ultra's camera AI can identify. However, we should be talking about stuff like humans, animals, vehicles, buildings, nature, food, etc. If the phone also reduces the noise in dark areas, it will address one of the few complaints about the current Ultra model's low-light images. Hopefully, Samsung will lend some of these improvements to the Galaxy S24 and Galaxy S24+ too.\n\nSamsung's 200MP cameras capture 12MP photos by default. They use pixel binning to merge neighboring pixels and capture more light. If the conditions are bright enough, you can manually switch to 50MP or 200MP modes for that extra bit of detail in photos. This has worked perfectly on the Galaxy S23 Ultra but the company will seemingly improve the implementation of pixel binning next year.\n\nThe Galaxy S24 Ultra is said to capture photos in a 24MP resolution by default. The information comes from X tipster Ahmed Qwaider. If true, the new Ultra will give you more details in images. Rumors say Samsung will unveil its 2024 flagship lineup on January 17.

        "body": "Kura's ultra-high performance multimodal AI and augmented reality platform transforms how humans learn, communicate, live and work\n\nSAN FRANCISCO, Dec. 19, 2023 /PRNewswire/ -- Kura, a pioneer and leader in generative multimodal AI and widest-FOV augmented reality technology, today announced that the company has been recognized as a CES 2024 Innovation Award honoree for its AR glasses. The award recognizes the product's custom AI framework and powerful developer tools that provides an unrivaled user experience.\n\nThe annual CES Innovation Award program recognizes outstanding design and engineering in consumer technology products. This year's CES innovation Awards program received a record-setting number of more than 3,000 submissions and is one of the most respected and renowned awards for frontier electronic devices. This is Kura's second CES honor.\n\n\"This is yet another significant milestone in Kura's journey, and this honor highlights our drive to integrate powerful artificial intelligence models with augmented reality to enhance our users' lives,\" said Kelly Peng, Founder of Kura. \"Imagine a powerful AI virtual assistant that follows you wherever you go, recognizing real-world objects and actions, and interacting with you in a very natural way -- that's what Kura will provide.\"\n\nTo date, Kura has met significant milestones, achieving an industry record 150-degree field-of-view with the Kura glasses and has provided demos to hundreds of users and professionals. Kura's product is enabled by Kura's customized design silicon -- through a partnership with TSMC (the world's largest semiconductor manufacturer) -- and world's first AI-generated optical design software, built by an in-house team led by Kura co-founder Bayley Wang, who worked on the world's first GPU-accelerated AI optical design tool at MIT.\n\nKura is also in the process of developing a multimodal AI platform and APIs which combine visual, voice, motion, and gesture inputs to augment users' workflow and activities. Kura currently supports general and domain-specific questions, real-time information retrieval and generation using large language models, and retrieval augmented generation (RAG), a technique which combines a fast and referenceable vector database with an LLM. With real-time visuals from the built-in camera system, imagery can also be used as part of the prompt.\n\n\"The Kura glasses see what the user sees, hear what they hear, and can act as an extension of human working memory and senses. What makes Kura different is that humans get about 80% of learning and input from visuals, and all AI software and applications are competing for the user's mobile and computer screen times these days,\" said Chuck Alger, Kura General Manager and former member of the Microsoft Hololens and Microsoft Surface teams. \"We're bringing AI from the era of phones without screens to today's modern age. Most AI wearables are simply like a speaker and microphone without a display, which is a good data collection device, but not effective at providing private input and instructions for complex tasks. Thanks to augmented reality, we can use an overlay to point out objects or places in the real world, dramatically enhancing the user experience.\"\n\nKura's glasses also dramatically outperform competing augmented reality products, offering best-in-industry field of view, transparency, resolution, and brightness, all in a compact form factor that is comfortable to wear daily. With a robust set of use cases -- from travel and entertainment to manufacturing, training, and even law enforcement -- the Kura glasses represent a major milestone in augmented reality and artificial intelligence.\n\n\"There's simply no other device on the market that offers 150-degree field-of-view, 95% lens transparency, and 8K resolution, especially in a form factor that mimics a pair of eyeglasses,\" said Gregory Gallinat, Chief Operations Officer of Kura and consumer electronics industry veteran. \"Our team boasts decades of experience in consumer technology, and it's an honor to be recognized by the Consumer Technology Association for developing these breakthroughs to supplement the user experience.\"\n\nSince its founding, Kura has received overwhelming demand, with orders and contracts from over 400 companies and government agencies worldwide, and is actively working with leaders in industrial manufacturing, automotive design, law enforcement, travel, and entertainment.\n\n\"Kura's vivid, immersive, and clear images enable broad use cases for product design, training, production, and visualization,\" commented SAIC Ventures, the venture branch of SAIC Motors, one of the world's largest automotive manufacturers, who is also an strategic investor in Kura. \"Enterprises in automotive and other manufacturing industries will benefit greatly from these new possibilities.\"\n\nTo learn more, please visit kura.tech.\n\nAbout Kura\n\nKura, headquartered in Silicon Valley, is building the world's most powerful augmented reality glasses and telepresence platform from the chip level up, and creating multimodal interactive AI for real-world applications. Founded by seasoned industry veterans and MIT alums, Kura's industry-leading technological solves the biggest industry adoption bottlenecks, and paves the way for broad use cases across a wide range of industries and disciplines to augment fundamental human capability, learning, communication, and productivity.

        "body": "Artificial intelligence (AI) has huge potential to advance the field of health and medicine, but the nation must be prepared to responsibly harness the power of AI and maximize its benefits, according to an editorial by Victor J. Dzau and colleagues. In addition to addressing key issues of equity across the innovation lifecycle, the authors argue that the scientific community must also decrease barriers to entry for large-scale AI capabilities and create dynamic, collaborative ecosystems for research and governance. The authors include suggestions for how the scientific community can tackle these challenges: First, advancing AI infrastructure for data, computation, health, and scale, in order to democratize access to both research and outcomes. Second, creating a flexible governance framework to ensure equity, prevent unintended consequences, and maximize positive impact. Third, building international collaborative efforts to efficiently expand scope and scale and to effectively address research questions of key interest to the global community. The National Academies are capable of playing a key role by convening stakeholders, enabling cross-sectoral discussions, and providing evidence-based recommendations in these areas, according to the authors. To see the ultimate vision of AI in health and medicine realized, the authors conclude, the scientific community must expand current capacity-building and governance efforts to successfully construct a strong foundation for the future.\n\nIn the same issue, Monica Bertagnolli, incoming director of the National Institutes of Health shares her perspective on the same topic.",

        "body": "The Urban Future Lab, New York City's hub for smart cities, smart grid, and clean energy at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering, recently announced the launch of its 2017 Urban Future Competition.\n\nSponsored by the New York State Energy Research and Development Authority (NYSERDA), the Urban Future Competition debuts the world's most revolutionary smart city, smart grid, and smart mobility technologies by bringing the brightest entrepreneurs together with mission-driven investors, policy leaders, and corporate sponsors for a prestigious pitch competition in New York City. The winner in each of three categories will get $50,000 cash and the opportunity to grow his or her business into a successful venture in one of New York State's most successful and longest-running cleantech business incubation programs, ACRE, housed in the Urban Future Lab in Downtown Brooklyn.\n\n'Startup Genome's 2017 Global Startup Ecosystem Report identified New York City as the second largest startup ecosystem in the world. The Urban Future Lab is that ecosystem's hub for all things smart city, smart grid, and clean energy,' said Pat Sapinsley, managing director of cleantech initiatives at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering. 'We are fortunate to be at the intersection of New York's supportive state and municipal policies and in a city whose massive size and diverse population makes it the ideal laboratory for creating and testing solutions to the world's most pressing challenges pertaining to sustainable urban development. Winners of the 2017 competition will join our vibrant community of change agents building a smarter, cleaner future for cities around the world.'\n\nNon-dilutive, non-equity, cash prizes of $50,000 will be awarded to the top company in each of the competition's three categories: the Smart City track, the Smart Grid track, and the Smart Mobility track. Applications for the Smart Mobility track could pertain to electric vehicles (EVs) and EV infrastructure solutions, high performance and low carbon vehicle materials, autonomous vehicle technology and mobility artificial intelligence (AI), digital tools for more connected mobility, alternative fuel technologies and infrastructure, or freight and logistics optimization solutions.

Additional NYSERDA incubators are located at academic institutions and venture development organizations in Long Island, Buffalo, Rochester, Syracuse, and Albany.\n\nIn joining the ACRE incubator at the Urban Future Lab, winners gain unprecedented access to the competition's strategic partners and corporate sponsors. They also benefit from networking events, workshops and skills enhancement boot camps, and share experiences, challenges, solutions, and contacts with fellow entrepreneurs.\n\nAlicia Barton, president and CEO at NYSERDA said, 'The State's clean energy incubators are playing a vital role in advancing innovative companies and business models that will help New York meet Governor Cuomo's nation-leading energy goals. I look forward to congratulating the winner of the competition and watching the company become part of New York's energized clean energy community.'\n\nApplications to the Urban Future Competition are now open until December 1, 2017. For more information and to apply, visit urbanfuturecompetition.com.\n\nAbout the NYU Urban Future Lab and ACRE\n\nThe Urban Future Lab (UFL) at the NYU Tandon School of Engineering is New York City's premier innovation hub for smart cities, the smart grid, and clean energy.

        "body": "Anticipating a bright future ahead, EY and Organisation of Pharmaceutical Producers of India (OPPI) in their recent report, 'Reimagining pharma and healthcare for India@100 - Bharat Ke Liye', highlighted the potential ambition for the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors in the coming decades.\n\nBetween September and October 2023, OPPI and EY undertook primary research, consulting with around 40 Chief Executive Officers (CXOs) from leading Indian and global multinational pharmaceutical companies and other industry organizations, to gain insights into the strategic priorities that will pave the way forward for the industry. Following are the focus areas that would help the Indian pharma and healthcare sectors in achieving the ambitious 2047 milestone:\n\n1. Unleashing pharma's value-driven research and innovation potential\n\nLeaders in global pharmaceutical companies agree that the next frontier for India is to focus on disruptive innovation. Establishing a resilient innovation ecosystem to foster collaborative engagement of various stakeholders, such as major pharmaceutical/biopharmaceutical entities, startups, biotechs, academia, and clinical researchers, is key to this shift towards value-driven innovation. This ecosystem's vitality is further contingent on facilitative elements like financing, infrastructure, and supportive policies and regulations.\n\nLarge pharmaceutical/biopharmaceutical companies play a pivotal role, not just in the research and development of drugs, but also in harnessing innovation potential emerging from academia and startups, and translating it into tangible market advancements. Global Capability Centers (GCCs) also make substantial contributions to the country's innovation ecosystem by fostering talent and skill development throughout the value chain, especially in intricate and strategic domains.\n\nIn September 2023, the government launched the National Policy on Research and Development and Innovation in Pharma-MedTech Sector in India and Scheme for promotion of Research and Innovation in Pharma MedTech Sector (PRIP) . The policy will help to strengthen the ecosystem of skills and capacities including the academia and the private sectors and give impetus to new talent among the youth through start-ups. It will also build synergies between various government institutions and agencies.\n\nNavigating the landscape of R&D with digital and data analytics:\n\nDigital technology, data analytics, and artificial intelligence (AI)/machine learning (ML) hold the potential to transform the entire R&D value chain, from the intricate stages of drug discovery to the complexities of clinical development. This transformation can enhance efficiency and productivity, reduce costs and timelines, and improve patient access and diversity. Leveraging its robust IT capabilities, India has the potential to spearhead advancements in this field globally, and also propel the innovation trajectory of the country's pharmaceutical industry.",

        "title": "Gaining 40% This Year, Will Revival In Cloud Demand And Generative AI Drive Snowflake Stock Higher?",
        "body": "Snowflake stock has gained about 40% year-to-date, amid increasing optimism of a revival in cloud spending by large businesses, although it has marginally underperformed the Nasdaq-100, which remains up by over 50% over the same period. Over Q3 FY'24 the company posted a better-than-expected set of results with product revenues jumping almost 34% year-over-year to $698.5 million. Snowflake also raised its full-year product revenue guidance, now projecting sales of $2.65 billion, up from a previous estimate of $2.6 billion. The company also boosted its full-year adjusted operating margin to 7%, up from a previous expectation of 5%. Key metrics have also remained strong. Snowflake's core revenue retention rate stood at a healthy 135%, indicating that the company continues to expand business with its existing customers.\n\nInvestors also appear to like the steps Snowflake is taking in the artificial intelligence space. Snowflake's core products help businesses store, organize, and analyze data across multiple cloud providers such as Amazon Web Services and Azure, and this positions the company well in building generative AI into its tools. For instance, the company launched Snowflake Cortex - a product that helps software developers build and run AI queries - last month. Earlier this year, the company introduced Snowpark Container Services which enables companies to deploy and run generative AI and full-stack apps on its platform. Snowflake also acquired Neeva, a startup that uses generative AI, to bring enhanced search capabilities to its products. Additionally, Nvidia - which is the go-to player for AI chips - said it was partnering with Snowflake to offer generative AI technology, specifically its artificial intelligence software, and chips, to Snowflake's cloud-based data warehousing customers earlier this year.\n\nNow looking over a longer window, SNOW stock has faced a notable decline of 30% from levels of $280 in early January 2021 to around $200 now, vs. an increase of about 25% for the S&P 500 over this roughly 3-year period. However, the decrease in SNOW stock has been far from consistent. Returns for the stock were 20% in 2021, -58% in 2022, and 39% in 2023. In comparison, returns for the S&P 500 have been 27% in 2021, -19% in 2022, and 23% in 2023 - indicating that SNOW underperformed the S&P in 2021 and 2022. In fact, consistently beating the S&P 500 - in good times and bad - has been difficult over recent years for individual stocks; for heavyweights in the Information Technology sector including AAPL, MSFT, and NVDA, and even for the megacap stars GOOG, TSLA, and AMZN. In contrast, the Trefis High Quality Portfolio, with a collection of 30 stocks, has outperformed the S&P 500 each year over the same period. Why is that? As a group, HQ Portfolio stocks provided better returns with less risk versus the benchmark index; less of a roller-coaster ride as evident in HQ Portfolio performance metrics. Given the current uncertain macroeconomic environment with high oil prices and elevated interest rates, could SNOW face a similar situation as it did in 2021 and 2022 and underperform the S&P over the next 12 months - or will it see a recovery?\n\nSnowflake trades at about 18x projected FY'24 revenue presently, which is below the 50x plus multiples the stock traded at the back at its peak in 2021. Snowflake is likely to be a big beneficiary of the continued pivot from on-premise databases to cloud-based warehousing solutions, with revenue growth projected at over 30% for next year as well, per consensus estimates. That said, Snowflake's growth is slowing down and the company's rising share count is also a concern. Weighted average shares outstanding is projected at 361 million shares for the end of fiscal 2024 compared to an average of less than 319 million in fiscal 2023, due to the company's heavy use of stock-based compensation. We value Snowflake stock at about $190 per share, which is slightly below the current market price. See our analysis Snowflake Valuation: Is SNOW Stock Expensive Or Cheap? for more details. See our analysis of Snowflake Revenue for more details on Snowflake's business model and how its revenues are expected to trend.",

AI technologies have significantly impacted marketplace operations, user experiences, and overall efficiency.\n\nWhen it comes to E-Commerce, AI has revolutionized the track of market.\n\nPersonalized Shopping Experience: AI-powered recommendation engines analyze customer behavior, preferences, and past purchases to provide personalized product recommendations. This enhances user experience, increases engagement, and boosts sales by offering relevant products to individual users. Unlike Myntra, Flipkart, Amazon there are many small business that has come into picture of gaining profits through match making personalized Experience.\n\nChatbots and Customer Support: AI-powered chatbots offer instant customer support, answer queries, assist in product selection, and provide personalized recommendations. They operate 24/7, improving customer service and engagement while reducing operational costs for businesses. The SME (subject matter expert) jobs are less in the E-Commerce market resulting the chatbot to take over.\n\nRecommendation Engines for Upselling and Cross-selling: AI-driven recommendation engines not only suggest products based on individual preferences but also assist in upselling and cross-selling by recommending complementary or higher-value products.\n\nData-driven Marketing and Customer Segmentation: AI helps in analyzing customer data to create targeted marketing campaigns. By segmenting customers based on behavior, demographics, and preferences, e-commerce businesses can tailor marketing strategies for specific audiences, leading to higher conversion rates.",

        "body": "These companies have significant earnings potential in AI, but one is trading at a bargain right now.\n\nIt's not often that a single market is able to reverse the effects of an overall market downturn. While it didn't work completely alone, the artificial intelligence (AI) industry was one of the leading growth drivers in the stock market's recovery in 2023.\n\nIn 2022, macroeconomic headwinds saw the Nasdaq Composite plunge 33%. However, the same index has surged 42% since Jan. 1, almost wholly based on excitement over AI. The launch of OpenAI's ChatGPT in November 2022 reignited interest in the technology and has seen countless tech firms pivot their businesses to the sector.\n\nAs a result, the AI market is projected to deliver a compound annual growth rate of 37% through 2030 (per Grand View Research). Despite bull runs for many AI stocks this year, there are still some attractive opportunities to invest in the $137 billion industry.\n\nAlphabet (GOOG 2.50%) (GOOGL 2.41%) and Amazon (AMZN 2.73%) are two compelling options -- both are home to some of the world's most recognizable brands and are heavily investing in the technology. So, let's examine whether Alphabet or Amazon is currently the better AI stock.\n\nAlphabet is no stranger to AI, with CEO Sundar Pichai saying in a blog post earlier this year that the tech giant was seven years into its journey as \"an AI-first company.\" However, like many firms, Alphabet has ramped up its expansion into the market in 2023.\n\nThe company started 2023 by unveiling Bard -- an AI chatbot designed to be an alternative to ChatGPT -- in February. The launch was a bit of a fumble, with Bard making mistakes at its debut presentation and leaving investors questioning Alphabet's prospects in AI. However, the company seemingly learned from the miss, pulling back to take the rest of the year to get its next project right.\n\nIn 2024, Alphabet will launch Gemini, a new large language model expected to be highly competitive with OpenAI's GPT-4.\n\nCombined with potent brands such as Google, Android, and YouTube, the company has almost endless opportunities to monetize its AI technology. From the ability to offer more efficient advertising to bringing AI upgrades to Google Search and Cloud, Alphabet could play a crucial role in getting AI into the hands of billions of consumers.\n\nMoreover, Alphabet posted more than $77 billion in free cash flow in 2023, more than Microsoft, Amazon, or Meta Platforms. The company has the funds and brand recognition to overcome potential headwinds and flourish in AI over the long term.\n\nAmazon has been a favorite on Wall Street in 2023, with its stock up about 80% since Jan. 1. The company has rallied investors with a return to growth in its e-commerce segments and a quickly expanding position in AI.\n\nBusinesses worldwide are increasingly seeking ways to integrate AI into their workflows. Meanwhile, cloud platforms like Amazon Web Services (AWS) are well equipped to meet rising demand and profit significantly over the long term.\n\nAWS holds a leading 32% market share in cloud computing, ahead of Microsoft's Azure and Google Cloud. Amazon is using its cloud dominance to get ahead in AI, introducing a diverse range of services to AWS this year. New tools such as Bedrock, CodeWhisperer, and HealthScribe use generative technology to help businesses boost productivity and could attract new customers to AWS in the coming years.\n\nIn addition to software, AWS announced a venture into chip development in June. Market leader Nvidia has enjoyed soaring earnings in 2023 thanks to a spike in AI chip sales. Amazon plans to challenge Nvidia's dominance in the near future as it works to strengthen and diversify its role in the budding industry.\n\nAlphabet and Amazon attract millions, if not billions, of users daily, making it challenging to go a single day without using at least one of their products. Their penetration in the consumer and commercial markets has given them massive earnings potential in AI over the long term. However, just because a company dominates an industry doesn't mean its stock trades at the right price.\n\nThis chart compares these companies' price-to-earnings ratios and price-to-free cash flows, with Alphabet winning on both fronts. Alphabet's significantly lower figures suggest its stock currently offers more value and is a bargain compared to Amazon's.\n\nAlphabet has been slightly overshadowed in AI by peers like Amazon and Microsoft in 2023. However, that has only kept its shares at an attractive price point, making it a screaming buy ahead of 2024 -- and the better AI stock.",

        "title": "The TRADE predictions series 2024: Foreign exchange, the regulatory impact - The TRADE",
        "body": "Participants across Liontrust Asset Management, BidFX, OSTTRA, and Integral explore the not so silent elephant in the room, T+1 settlement and its impact on foreign exchange, and more.\n\nMartin Hendry, deputy head of trading, Liontrust Asset Management\n\nAs we peer into the crystal ball for 2024 trading, a notable shift is anticipated with the adoption of T+1 settlement for US equity transactions. This transition is poised to reshape the pace and efficiency of equity trading, promoting quicker settlement cycles. It's fully expected that the spotlight will turn towards the foreign exchange element, often deemed the least loved asset class.\n\nAsset managers and traders are expected to re-evaluate FX markets, seeking evolution from the industry to source liquidity later in the trading day around the US close. Concurrently, the need for market participants to embrace technology becomes increasingly apparent. Automation, artificial intelligence, and data analytics are anticipated to play pivotal roles in refining trading strategies and navigating the complexities of across asset classes in this tech-driven financial landscape of 2024.\n\nDaniel Chambers, head of data and analytics, BidFX (an SGX company)\n\nThis year has seen investors hanging on every word uttered by central banks around interest rates. Changes in interest rates inevitably drive FX markets. Depending on how markets react to monetary policy next year, and whether volatility returns to FX, there will be an even greater need to actively assess liquidity in a much more granular way. That said, even if FX markets are more benign in the New Year, this will not put a stop to the general trend of hedge funds and asset managers seeking more precise insights from their liquidity providers. 2024 will see investment managers ask why their FX flow has been directed to certain counterparties, rather than passively accepting the liquidity provider's perspective.\n\nRather than simply looking at FX flow distribution, investment managers will be demanding insight into the exact rationale behind a certain bid/offer price being offered up at 11:55am just prior to the Bank of England's rate decision. They will also want to know who is providing the tightest spreads at that exact time, in addition to identifying those at the top of the order book and those displaying a price skew.\n\nBasu Choudhury, head of partnerships and strategic initiatives, OSTTRA\n\nOne of the big challenges for 2024, assuming the successful operational migration over to T+1 for US securities in May, is how will the FX markets (execution venues, makers and takers, intermediaries) react to the compression of execution times in the context of constrained settlement relationships? What will this imply for post-trade processing (matching and settlement) and provisioning of credit, the life blood in FX markets? The shortening of the settlement cycle for US equities and bonds brings settlement risk into sharp focus for FX participants. What challenges will Asian and European asset managers face with their FX overlay process? It is likely that currency risks and costs will increase for the end customer.\n\nWhen buying US stocks, from an FX perspective, in order to fund the purchase of the stocks, the investment manager will need to convert their Singapore dollars into US dollars within a compressed timeframe. Therefore, to mitigate the risk of failing to settle due to not having enough dollars to pay for the stocks, some key questions will need to be addressed. For instance, at the time they need to execute FX transactions which liquidity pool and how many counterparties can they execute with in order to acquire the USD in time for DvP settlement?\n\nVikas Srivastava, chief revenue officer, Integral\n\nThe introduction of T+1 in North America in May 2024 understandably occupies the thinking of technology officers and heads of desks for their FX trading activities. The challenge primarily sits with those asset managers in Europe and APAC trading in US markets who will have a matter of hours to match and settle both the equities and FX leg of the trade in order to settle T+1.\n\nThe only real solution to this issue is automation of trading workflows. Banks should see this as an opportunity to better serve their clients in their hour of need by directly embedding their services into their buy-side clients' workflows. Banks should be looking to partner with technology firms that enable them to embed their FX services via API in their clients' processes.",

        "title": "Marriott Stock Remains An Unbeatable Giant In The Rebounding Market (NASDAQ:MAR)",
        "body": "The stock price remains undervalued with attractive upside potential.\n\nThe hotel industry plunged into its rock-bottom at the height of the pandemic. But three years later, the picture has completely changed. It has already regained its footing and is poised to reach pre-pandemic levels. It does not show a possibility of a slowdown amid macroeconomic volatility. Thanks to the resilient travel spending and changing work landscape that allow more people to make domestic and international trips.\n\nMarriott International, Inc. (NASDAQ:MAR) enjoys a favorable tourism trend. It shows stable top-line growth and decent liquidity as it expands and builds more properties. Also, it has a solid market positioning with its huge operating capacity and efficiency. Even better, the stock has paid off over the years having the best returns since the Great Recession. It outperformed its close peers like Hilton (HLT) and Hyatt (H). The current price also makes the stock an excellent buy.\n\nMarriott has already escaped the pandemic quicksand and remained a hotel giant. And today, it continues to dominate the market with its impressive top-line growth and sustained expansion. Thanks to revenge travel and the company's prudent asset management.\n\nThe total operating revenue for the third quarter reached $5.93B, a 12% YoY increase. QoQ growth inched down by 2.4%, which we can attribute to the inflation uptick from July to September. This can be observed mainly in its US and Canadian markets. Yet, the opposite can be seen in its international market, particularly in Asia Pacific. In fact, its RevPAR in the region rose by 22%, driven by the sustained increase in the number of properties and occupancy and room rates. In only a year, the total number of its rooms worldwide increased by more than 70,000, bringing the total to 1,581,002. The increase was much higher than of its close peers namely Hilton and Hyatt. We will make a comprehensive comparison of these lodging companies in the next section. With its huge market presence and solid brand recognition, it has expanded its customer base domestically and internationally.\n\nGiven this, discretionary spending, particularly on tourism, has been resilient. This was mainly driven by external factors other than the pent-up travel demand. Prudent economic policies, stable labor market conditions, and digital transformation were some factors.\n\nFirst, macroeconomic improvements in the labor market have been visible. These have helped a lot of people withstand inflationary pressures. For instance, the unemployment rate in the US had an uptick in recent months. Yet, we can see it was primarily driven by the higher number of people entering and reentering the labor force. Most importantly, the average hourly wage in the US has risen continuously since its recovery from the pandemic. This helped many people with purchasing power, especially non-essential items and services. This fueled their desire to travel after being locked in homes for about a year.\n\nSecond, the labor market transformation has been very favorable for the tourism sector. The prevalence of remote work flexibility in businesses helped employees increase their travel frequency. Since 2022, its impact on the travel landscape has been evident. It increased hotel occupancy rates and improved flexibility with hotel booking rates. It was especially helpful for Marriott since its business model is mainly fee-based. It's easier for MAR to adjust rates to demand and macroeconomic changes in contrast than a lease-based model. In a study, over half of American travelers spend more on travel than they did in the previous year. Regarding frequency, over 80% are traveling more often today than they did in 2022. Pandemic-driven revenge travel remains an essential factor since 29% of the respondents agree that their travel plans today are related to delays in the past three years. Another study reveals that 40.7% of full-time employees are working either remotely or hybrid. Unsurprisingly, the estimated number of Americans working remotely may reach 32.6 million by 2025. Hence, more and more people may maintain or increase their travel spending and frequency.\n\nThird, cost pressures have started to ease as inflation decelerated to 3-4% from 9.1%. This reflects the successful action of The Fed to cushion the blow. While higher interest rates discouraged borrowings and investments, personal loans remained unfazed. More households used credit cards for their essential and non-essential spending like leisure travel. And as the Fed Rate Hike Pause continues this holiday season, travel continues to boom. Hotels like Marriott are once again encouraged to increase their capacity to accommodate more guests.\n\nGiven all these, Marriott is taking advantage of all market opportunities. As of 3Q23, its occupancy rate was already 72.1% compared to 68.9% in 3Q22. It was still much lower than in 3Q19 with 76.0% since the economy has yet to stabilize amid recession woes. The continued expansion of Marriott also contributed to the wide gap. With the continued travel uptrend and increased property construction of MAR, it is poised to fully recover by 2025. It still has a lot of growth drivers, which we will discuss thoroughly in the succeeding parts.\n\nEven better, it kept costs and expenses reasonable relative to the continued expansion. MAR showed increased efficiency with easing cost pressures as it expanded. Its prudent and competitive hotel rates helped it cover and outweigh costs and expenses. Also, the slowing inflation helped it manage variable costs better. In turn, the operating margin remained stable with a slight increase from 18.1% in 3Q22 and 18.0% in 2Q23 to 18.5% in 3Q23. Indeed, MAR enjoys solid top-line growth. As MAR increases its hotels and rooms, it has more upside in 4Q22 and the whole of FY24.\n\nMAR has endured the blows of the pandemic recession, exacerbated by zero-tolerance restrictions. But over the next three years, it has regained its footing. Although it hasn't reached pre-pandemic levels, the consistent uptrend is remarkable. It's no surprise it is poised to complete its recovery in about a year or two. The important thing is that it continues to generate high revenues while keeping costs and expenses manageable. This is an essential attribute amid the still elevated prices and interest rates. These are some of the things I consider to say Marriott is a solid company.\n\nCost reimbursements comprise 74% of Marriott's total revenue, showing it uses a managed-based model. But in reality, the majority of its business runs a fee-based model. Over 70% of revenues are from base management, franchise, and incentive fees. To prevent confusion, you may read here to better understand how cost reimbursement works for MAR. Cost reimbursement tends to understate MAR's operating income. But it also gives a clearer picture of Marriott's revenue generation from its franchisees, lessees, and customers and how it allocates it to employees.\n\nI like its fee-based model since this is very favorable for the company at this point. Tourism is booming. Revenge travel is resilient. More people are planning to travel next year. It is also flexible to macroeconomic and market changes. Since many of its hotels are under its management, it can easily adjust rates to market demand. Also, it is secure even during economic downturns since franchise fees are constant payments to MAR. It may vary depending on the revenue generated by its franchisees. This gives it an edge over many of its peers, primarily Hyatt. The latter has a greater concentration on lease revenues, which are relatively inflexible than fee revenues.\n\nMeanwhile, Hilton also concentrates more on fees than leases. But if we get the percentage of their respective leases to revenues, MAR has only 6% while HLT has 13%. With that, MAR has more flexible revenue streams. We can see how advantageous a fee-based model is in their operating revenue. Both MAR and HLT had double-digit revenue growth in 3Q23, while Hyatt decreased by 5%. Hilton has a higher revenue increase of 12.7% versus MAR with 11.7%. Nonetheless, their actual revenue gap continued to widen. In 3Q22, MAR's revenue was higher by $2.94B. In 3Q23, it rose to $3.26B. Indeed, MAR continues to dominate the hotel industry.\n\nMarriott remains a formidable hotel with its fee-based model. But what makes it a durable giant is its sustained expansion and solid brand recognition. Its prudent pricing strategy on room rates allows it to compete even with smaller peers. We can see it in its impressive RevPAR growth. Its domestic growth was a bit slower than expected, but it rose by over 20% in Asia Pacific. It amounted to $129.73 and was higher than HLT with $121.37. Yet, both were much lower than H with $194, driven by its average daily rate. Even so, we must remember that the difference in the available rooms between MAR and H is still over one million.\n\nWhat makes MAR much ahead of the competition is its swift and sustained yet prudent expansion. It is a driving force toward growth as tourism recovers and returns to pre-pandemic levels. With the prevalent remote work setup, many employees can now go on vacation despite their busy schedules. MAR is ready after opening 73,652 new rooms. The total number of 1,581,002 is much higher than Hilton, with 1,159,783 (opened 48,636 new rooms), and Hyatt with 313,257 (18,369 new rooms). Its total properties are now 8,675 (built 503 new properties) versus HLT with 7,399 (built 338 new properties) and H with 1,310 (built 99 new properties). Hence, MAR has a much larger capacity to accommodate guests all over the world and generate more revenues.\n\nMarriott is a capital-intensive company, so liquidity is a crucial aspect to consider. Cash and borrowings substantially increased from 3Q22 to 3Q23. It can be discouraging at this point. Yet, we can attribute it to its increased spending and leverage to cover its expansion. Also, interest rates are still elevated. On a lighter note, its EBITDA rose by almost 30%, showing that its expansion had been fruitful. With that, its Net Debt/EBITDA decreased from 2.67x to 2.64x, both lower than the maximum of 3.5x-4.0x. This shows the company is earning enough to cover borrowings in a short period.\n\nOver the years, the stock market has been through crests and troughs, and MAR is no exception. Despite this, MAR and the whole S&P 500 (SPX) showed resilience as the economy recovered. Even better, MAR has shown double-digit and better-than-market-average stock price returns. I compared the ten-year historical prices of MAR to HLT, H, and SPX. I assessed their performance using their actual returns and volatility using the Sharpe Ratio, Treynor Ratio, and Jensen's Alpha.\n\nBy weighing their risks and returns, the three hotel stocks have outperformed the SPX. Even better, MAR remains the most solid stock with its impressive performance. As you can notice, MAR, HLT, and H have a negative Treynor Ratio due to negative beta. Their slope relative to the SPX is negative, so we can't determine which is the best stock among them. That is why I also used Jensen's Alpha and proved that MAR was the best stock among the three hotels.\n\nHotels and other lodging properties have been experiencing a boom in the past three months. Despite the initial worries about recession, travel spending remains resilient. Primary growth drivers are the pent-up demand for travel fueled by hybrid work prevalence and credit card accessibility. Marriott enjoys this trend with its impeccable revenue growth. These drivers can help the company sustain its growth and expansion.\n\nWinter travel expectations are still rosy even if the Summer and Autumn hype have already ebbed. The extremely cold weather does not seem to stop people globally from traveling this Winter. Various studies show that revenge travel is here to stay. One shows 83% of Americans planning to take at least one trip by the end of this year.\n\nAnother noticeable trend is that air travel is increasing faster than land travel. We can attribute it to the decreasing fuel prices, which help stabilize airfares. Right now, the number of domestic travelers is seen to be up by 2.2% from December 23 to January 1. More specifically, the number of people traveling by air this holiday season will reach 115.2 million. While it is still lower than the 2019 peak of 119 million, recovery is now within reach.\n\nIn addition, the demand for RVs has decreased after RV prices skyrocketed. For a while, people have chosen campsites and domestic destinations to cope with inflation. But as inflation decelerated and the RV prices became less appealing, more travelers turned to other destinations. This is an opportunity for hotels as they also compete with RVs, which serve both for driving and lodging.\n\nAnd now, artificial intelligence (AI) is becoming the crown jewel of many companies across different sectors. Even hotels are already seeing how AI can boost digital strategy, improve system integration, enhance efficiency to reduce costs, and reach out to more customers through social media and its more responsive web design. Marriott also embraces AI to personalize customer experience. For instance, it has extended to social media using organic and paid social content to generate potential customers. Collecting relevant email addresses and leveraging analytics are also part of it. AI can customize recommendations and offer more targeted services based on consumer behavior. It is often partnered with ChatGPT for better customer service and interaction.\n\nMore interestingly, Marriott uses AI algorithms to adjust room prices dynamically based on market demand and supply to increase revenues and occupancy rates. It helps the company keep room rates competitive while keeping its demand. MAR also uses AI to adjust staffing levels and assignments based on business needs.\n\nAs inflation stabilizes again, the Fed has kept policy rates unchanged again. Given this, it is easier for people and businesses to pay their borrowings and attract investments. It is more crucial for MAR, given the high capital intensity. This can help the company keep or even increase its liquidity level. Also, people will be more confident about using their credit cards for non-essential spending like travel amid holiday spending splurge.\n\nInflation has continuously decelerated from its 9.1% peak in June 2022. Despite this, policymakers are keen on the possibility of an inflation increase. Holiday spending splurges may drive this and may affect fuel prices. Also, fuel prices may be affected by the Winter demand. They must also keep watch of the Israel-Palestine War as the OPEC oil cuts remain a concern. If it persists, fuel prices may rebound and impact transportation and airfares. Although revenge travel remains solid, this may affect travel spending.\n\nAirbnb rooms are the primary competitors of the hotel industry. They cater to many backpackers and those who wish to lodge at a more manageable price. They can be predatory and work against hotels. Thankfully, MAR appears to be ahead of the competition as it has already started offering private home rentals in 2019. It is crucial to join this niche to ensure the company can keep customer base.\n\nThe stock price of Marriott has increased over the years. Despite the sudden drop due to the pandemic and inflationary headwinds in 2022, the stock kept rebounding. It has stayed in an uptrend allowing investors to generate returns. At $221.24, it has already risen by 43% in only a year. Investors may see the price a bit high to make a buy position. Yet, MAR still shows promising upside potential. These are supported by the key drivers and the impressive aspects discussed in the previous section. MAR still has room to expand and generate more returns to support the stock price increase.\n\nIts PE Ratio of 23.44x is also much cheaper than that of HLT at 35.79x and H at 28.98x. With that, MAR is still trading at a more reasonable price relative to its earnings. And to better assess the stock price of Marriott, I used the DCF Model since MAR is capital-intensive. The DCF Model is a better method to analyze the intrinsic value of the company. I derived the growth rate in line with the target inflation of the US Fed. Also, I expect MAR's revenue growth to normalize in the next five years. The double-digit growth shows MAR is still in its recovery phase toward pre-pandemic highs. Meanwhile, I derived the WACC by getting the debt and equity components using the Capital Asset Pricing Model.\n\nThe screenshot shows how I got the target price of $304.12. I also made a sensitivity table to demonstrate how the price will vary with the growth rate and WACC. We can see that the stock price remains undervalued regardless of the percentage. The target price shows that the upside potential of the stock price is still high by 36%, so MAR is still an excellent buy.\n\nMarriott International, Inc. remains a formidable figure in the hotel industry. With its massive size and sustained expansion, it caters to a wide range of customers based on their preferences and capacity. It also maintains adequate liquidity to cover its business operations, dividends, and borrowings. Also, it has enticing growth drivers, which may allow MAR to generate more revenues. Travel is still on its way to pre-pandemic peak, and its current trajectory shows MAR will reach it in no time. Even better, the stock price remains bullish and has many upside drivers. That is why I still recommend Marriott as a great buy.",

To create a strong squad, team combinations and squad dynamics must be carefully considered. The right combination of talented players, balanced with the team's budget and playing requirements, can pave the way for victory in IPLAution 2024.\n\nOne important aspect of team combinations is understanding squad dynamics. This involves assessing the strengths and weaknesses of each player, and aligning them with the team's requirements. An effective way to achieve this is to divide the players into different categories based on their roles, such as batsmen, all-rounders, and bowlers. By doing so, teams can identify areas that need strengthening and invest in players accordingly.\n\nFurthermore, teams must also consider playing conditions when selecting their squad. Teams must assess the pitch and weather conditions of the stadiums they will play in and choose players who can perform with consistency. A well-balanced squad with players who can perform under various conditions can give a team a significant advantage in IPLAution 2024.\n\nSquad Dynamics in Action: The Mumbai Indians\n\nThe Mumbai Indians have been a dominant force in the IPL, winning five titles to date. Their squad, which has been a well-balanced team since the beginning, is a testament to the importance of squad dynamics in creating a winning IPL team. One crucial decision that has paid off tremendously is their extensive use of all-rounders. These players can bat, bowl, and field, making them valuable assets in team combinations.\n\nPlayer Role\n\nRohit Sharma Batsman\n\nHardik Pandya All-rounder\n\nJasprit Bumrah Bowler\n\nKieron Pollard All-rounder\n\nIshan Kishan Batsman\n\nTrent Boult Bowler\n\nAs seen in the table above, the Mumbai Indians have a well-balanced squad that consists of batsmen, all-rounders, and bowlers. This team combination has allowed them to maintain a consistent winning streak over the years, making them a formidable team to beat in IPLAution 2024.\n\nIn summary, team combinations and squad dynamics play an essential role in creating a winning team in IPLAution 2024. By carefully assessing player roles, strengths, and playing conditions, teams can build a cohesive squad that can deliver phenomenal results on the field.\n\nBudgeting Strategies in IPLAution 2024\n\nFinancial planning and budgeting are crucial aspects to consider during IPLAution 2024.

And the AI companies with the strongest business models will stand the test of time.\n\nLet's explore some reasons why Nvidia (NASDAQ: NVDA) and Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN) look to be among the best in an increasingly competitive field, and could make excellent buys in 2024.\n\nIf you liken the artificial intelligence boom to the California Gold Rush, Nvidia would sell the picks and shovels instead of mining for gold. This strategy gives the company a massive market opportunity and shields it from rising competition in the more consumer/client-focused side of the industry. And despite its market cap of $1.21 trillion, investors aren't too late to bet on the chip makers' long-term potential.\n\nNvidia's third-quarter revenue more than doubled to $18.12 billion because of surging demand for its data center chips, which are used to train and run the most advanced generative AI applications.\n\nThis level of growth is staggering for such a large company. More importantly, it is translating to record-breaking profitability. Net income surged more than 1,200% to $9.24 billion. This can be credited to Nvidia's spectacular pricing power because of low competition, which has led to high margins.\n\nRivals such as Advanced Micro Devices are racing to bring competition to the AI chip market. But with industry experts expecting the opportunity to be worth $400 billion by 2027, there is plenty of room for more players.\n\nWhile Nvidia's trailing price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 65 looks high compared to the S&P 500 average of 26, this is a backward-looking metric that doesn't account for the company's epic growth rate. With a forward price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 25, Nvidia stock is still affordable relative to its projected earnings.\n\nLike Nvidia, Amazon is another technology giant focusing on the infrastructure side of the AI opportunity, albeit a little bit further up the food chain. The company is incorporating AI-related services into its cloud computing platform AWS, and this could add much-needed growth and diversification to its sprawling technology empire.\n\nIn September, Amazon announced the general availability of Bedrock, a platform designed to help clients build and scale customizable AI models. Bedrock will compete with similar services from rivals like Alphabet and Microsoft. But its association with the AWS ecosystem (the leading cloud service provider) could give it an economic moat. Because of its scale, more users are familiar with AWS, and enterprises may prefer to take a one-stop-shop approach to all their cloud computing needs.\n\nAmazon has also built its own AI-capable chips, Trainium and Inferentia, which could help lower costs and reduce Amazon's dependence on third-party providers for its hardware.\n\nWith a forward P/E of 40, Amazon stock isn't cheap. But part of the premium valuation can be explained by management's ongoing cost-cutting efforts, which are improving the company's bottom line. Third-quarter net income rose 244% year over year to $9.88 billion.\n\nThroughout their histories, Nvidia and Amazon have gone through substantial evolutions in their business models.\n\nNvidia made its name selling GPUs for personal computers before demand shifted toward cryptocurrency mining and data centers. Amazon started off as an online bookseller before transitioning to a generalized third-party marketplace that gets most of its profits from cloud computing.\n\nArtificial intelligence could end up becoming the next big growth opportunity for both companies, and it isn't too late for investors to bet on their transitions.\n\nThe Motley Fool Stock Advisor analyst team just identified what they believe are the 10 best stocks for investors to buy now... and Nvidia wasn't one of them. The 10 stocks that made the cut could produce monster returns in the coming years.\n\nStock Advisor provides investors with an easy-to-follow blueprint for success, including guidance on building a portfolio, regular updates from analysts, and two new stock picks each month.
